<div class="content">There's a lot of benefit to setting up circumstances to make yourself get some things done.  This week, I have:<br><br>- arranged for my work 'babysitter' to come out this weekend and work with me on my consulting contract<br>- arranged for a utility trailer to take a load to the dump (getting me to rip up the last of the old carpet and declutter a bunch of big things, as well as getting me to make a decision on what to toss or not)<br>- had friends over, which forces me to clean the house<br><br>I really must do this more often...<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Why else?  Unless it's to discuss the question of angels dancing on the head of pins?  That's always a lot of fun at parties.  :-)<br><br>The only downside to this is it's just Saturday morning and I'm already wiped...

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>I don't want to tell you something you already know but just in case you are not being ironic:<br><br>In the middle ages, church philosophers had nothing much better to do than debate and at the height of that absurdity was the long debate about how many angles could dance on the head of a pin.  Since that time, the question has come to stand for pointless and unresolvable debate.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Thanks for the info.  My comment was only partly tongue in cheek - I have heard the expression but had no idea where it came from or how it had come about (guess I could have googled it !).  Much as I enjoy psychology I've not studied it in depth, my main knowledge in that area is from various courses but not at great depth.  Likewise with philosophy. I've not studied the philosophers - something else to do when I have time, or consider it of sufficient importance to me to make the time :-)  I usually look up most stuff I need to know on google, or research any references that aren't familiar to me when I need to.  I enjoyed the link to calculation of how many angels it was though :-)<br><br>So thank you - info appreciated :-)</div>

<div class="content">Norman, why would you say that?  Probability would be strongly against it.  :-)<br><br>I've been thinking about this further, and creating external commitments really is a great tool if you use it deliberately on a regular basis where you can.  I tend to work much faster and in a more focused, decisive way because the time is limited.   How well it works might depend on the individual and how good they are at keeping commitments though.</div>

<div class="content">Love the website Norman!!  <br><br>This is what I don't get - if you figure that thanks to the net, office workers are about 25-50% less productive than they were 10 or 20 years ago - why hasn't the number of hours you have to be at work reduced?  Why is it still 40 hour weeks (minimum)?  Then go home and surf the net if you want to.  Or real surfing.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-19 23:41</div>
<div class="content">Mark, no, I think we, as a society, are actually less productive, or at least not substantially more productive in some areas.   And I'm thinking more about knowledge vs. physical work.<br><br>If we consider that technology has improved overall efficiency in some ways - eg. use of computers vs. manual systems, that efficiency has been offset (in the finance industry anyway) by an increase in the volume of work often required.  eg. increased audit / SOX requirements due to Enron/Arthur Anderson style downfalls, and increased reporting requirements overall.   <br><br>In the last 5 years or so, I have seen a tremendous amount of people who abuse internet privileges at work.  Some can spend up to 80% of their time on facebook or IM-ing friends.  15 years ago the only way you could have goofed off that much would be by talking on the phone or visiting with people at work - both of which are pretty obvious.   I'm no saint either, and I would bet that my time spent actually working has probably gone down by at least 10% or more.  I'm just basing my opinion on personal observation.</div>

<div class="content">I guess we are back to my favourite hobby horse, of how do you measure productivity, see<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/716129" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/716129</a><br><br>where it was never really satisfactorily answered. I think you can come up with satisfactory measures for factory workers on a production line, but even for low level office workers it becomes problematical. I believe there are studies which support Jacqueline's view above (I would need to work to dig them out), but if they measure productivity by say the number of routine letters written in a day, I am not sure they are very useful to most people on this forum. How do you measure productivity if you are an author? Surely not just by the number of words written in a day. Or what about a sculptor? What about a research academic like me: do you count the number of ideas I have in a day? If so "abusing" internet privileges may be precisely the best way of making me more productive. Or do you count the number of published papers in a year, even if nobody reads them. In the UK the government spends millions on the Research Assessment Exercise every few years trying to answer this question, generally with highly dubious (dare I say meaningless) results in the opinion of most people (which is why they keep on changing the methodology regularly)<br><br>In any case, I personally am more interested in efficiency, not productivity. I personally am quite happy if I can achieve the same amount with only 50% effort, knowing full well that if I got rid of that "wasted" 50% I would probably not achieve much more overall.</div>
<h2>Reply by Christine B</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-05-20 9:04</div>
<div class="content">Hi Jaroslav<br><br>I think your comment about efficiency is a very good point.  I think productivity can only be accurately measured when used in reference to physical production, eg widget manufacture.  The difference between production of 20 widgets or 30 widgets in a day is specific and measurable.  However when we talk of "personal productivity" we are generally referring to efficiency.<br><br>My own measurement for what it is worth is aligned to focussed attention on qualifying tasks.  The make up of those tasks is largely irrelevant; what matters is that they are specific determined tasks and perceived as having value.Taking an AutoFocus list as an example those tasks can vary from cleaning the floo,r to shopping, to meetings, to writing a novel.  It is the focus and attention that, to me, defines productivity rather than the actions themslves.<br><br>Obviously taking it further issues arise when the tasks are not perceived as having value to the person doing them.  If I am in a meeting not of my choosing, that I feel is a waste of my time, then I will not be focussed and will feel unproductive.  The attention I give to a task, from a focussed point of view will be heavily influenced by my internal feelings of value of that task.<br><br>That is where AutoFocus also has a massive impact.  Rather than just coasting along with a vague feeling of frustration over what we are doing, AutoFocus ultimately forces to look at the tasks that we have entered - which will inevitably form the bulk of our normal everday "doing" - and ultimately question their value.  Those tasks which we identify as having no current value will be dismissed and we will be able to identy, through identifying resistance, those tasks which maybe have someone else's value rather than our own.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>I started my work life in the early 60s, when we had no computers, no internet, no texting, no mobile phones, no email, no photocopiers. Basically all we did have was paper and a big black bakelite phone, which we weren't allowed to use in the morning because the charges were higher. Everything I wrote had to be done in longhand and then passed to the typing pool (I was far too junior to qualify for a shorthand secretary). To contact people in other countries was virtually impossible and indeed would never have occurred to us as an option. We were held accountable for every penny spent. Transport was slow, unreliable, and unpleasant.<br><br>We were certainly just as capable of bunking off as anyone is today. It was easier then in fact because open-plan offices weren't yet widespread.<br><br>But as far as productivity is concerned, absolutely nothing that I do today in a business context would have been possible then. It would have been completely inconceivable. I don't personally think that modern technology and communications have made us necessary more efficient or effective. What it has done is give us gigantically more choice about what we can do and freedom to do it.</div>

<div class="content">Christine and Jaroslav:<br><br>I think ultimately you can only really judge the effectiveness of a time management system by looking back over a period of say a year and asking yourself what the year felt like. Do you have a good year, did you enjoy it, were you satisfied with what you achieved? and so on.</div>
<h2>Reply by Jaroslav</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-05-20 12:34</div>
<div class="content">Mark<br><br>regarding your response to Jacqueline, I agree that the range of what we can do has immensely expanded with technological development and we now have far more freedom and choice. But how many of us (and I would be the first to point the finger at myself) know how to use this freedom wisely and to our benefit. Or to put it bluntly, does it make us happier?<br><br>There is also the question of quality of work. I too started work when what was possible was much more limited (though not quite as early as you) and for instance the practicalities of writing and publishing a paper, or giving a talk at a conference, were much harder and slower. Access to the work of others was often snail paced, at a rate that today's students find inconceivable (for them, if the information cannot be found on the web in 5 minutes, it does not exist). Yet, most of my colleagues and I feel that the quality and originality of what we were doing 30 years ago was much higher (even if the quantity was lower). I heard a talk by a Nobel prize winner (probably Sydney Brenner, or perhaps Francis Crick) a few years back in which they described the practicalities of work in the 50s and 60s, completely removed from today's research environment. Yet the sheer brilliance of what they achieved within those constraints is outstanding.<br><br>I wonder if anyone here has read Fear of Freedom (published as Escape from Freedom in the USA) by Erich Fromm. From what I remember when I read it last time (its on my AF list to be re-read) is seems very relevant to these issues. <br><br>Regarding your 10:18 message, I totally agree, but aren't you really saying that more with your life coach hat on than someone who devises time management systems? A time management system may make achieving those goals a little easier or harder, but you have to have the right goals, and know what gives you a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment before you start. I for one am struggling with that far more at the moment than with the effectiveness with of AF.</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>Totally agree.  Looking back on the last 4.5 months since starting AF I can honestly say it is the most effective system I have ever worked with - and that is despite the fact that I am not using it to it's fullest capacity.<br><br>I get frustrated that I cannot always work effectively for other reasons but the fact is that, despite limitations, I am keeping up with current stuff and am also clearing backlog issues.  Amazing!</div>

<div class="content">Jaroslav:<br><br>In answer to your first point - I certainly agree with what you are saying in many ways. The metaphor I often use is of a menu. The old days are like the menu I used to get at school:<br><br>Disgusting brown soup with unnamed bits floating in it<br>Disgusting sausages and mash (with lumps)<br>Disgusting stewed fruit (needing at least three spoonfuls of sugar)<br><br>Basically you either liked it or lumped it (as we say in England). But it kept you alive and healthy.<br><br>Today is like going into a restaurant with a 40 page menu of stuff all of which sounds fantastic. You are faced with a huge amount of choice, but in the end you still have to whittle it down to what you can eat in one meal.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-20 12:57</div>
<div class="content">Jaroslav:<br><br>In answer to your final point - I don't think I agree with you here. Being able to manage your time effectively has a huge effect on your quality of life quite independent of what your goals are. The stress and misery caused by having huge backlogs and a record of failure to carry things through is enormous.<br><br>Your time management capability also affects the goals you take on. If you know that you are unlikely to be able to handle a difficult or challenging project, then you are unlikely to take the risk of choosing such a project in the first place. Being able to trust yourself to carry through vastly expands the range of things which you are willing to take on.</div>

<div class="content">"I am getting paid, so I read this forum looking for something helpful"<br><br>But, wouldn't that be an "incredible waste of time." The AF instructions are simple, so why do the every thing you claim is in overuse. Why tempt fate? Worse, does your boss know your wasting their money perusing sites during work hours? Moreover I'm not sure why you felt the need to insult those of us that find the internet helpful and pleasurable. Worse, you made the comment using the interwebz. That's akin to walking into a church to use the phone and claiming: "Huh, look at all these sheep roaming about the pews". <br><br>"Can't speak for you; can only speak for I. Sorry."<br><br>I agree. Which is why I found your post most unhelpful. But I wonder if your comments would be better suited to a personal blog? <br><br>"If you are having trouble getting things done, why be on a productivity forum? Go do those things you think you need to be doing."<br><br>Norman - that's truly bizarre. The only people I know who ingest the GTD/COVEY/AUTOFOCUS lit are people who have trouble getting things done. <br><br>As I mentioned in another post, my wife was able to get through 4 years of medical school and 5 years of residency without reading a sentence about project planning, etc. My most productive friends are the same. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Avrum, I was also super-productive when I was in my 20's and had great clarity about my goals and what I wanted to achieve (and the belief that I could actually do everything).  All without reading a single book on time management.   Then I got into jobs that weren't right for me that I had to push myself to do, had my mid-life crisis a bit early, and the more navel gazing I did, the worse I felt ...  <br><br>Which comes back to Mark's point above:<br><br>"The stress and misery caused by having huge backlogs and a record of failure to carry things through is enormous.<br><br>Your time management capability also affects the goals you take on.

<div class="content">Jacqueline, interesting comments about why people are on a productivity forum. It certainly doesn't mean we're not productive. I think I am in need of being more relaxed and forgiving of myself when I don't do everything I thought or said I could do. Though I wish I could plan tasks for each day that would always be completed, I honestly think that would be the most boring and depressing of circumstances for me. I read this forum always looking for something new to challenge me.</div>

<div class="content">Mel, I didn't mean we all aren't productive, just that we all have an issue or something that we want to improve or work on (sometimes that we're too work-focused!) and we're looking for a better way - so maybe "problem with productivity" isn't the right phrase.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>with regard to your post on May 20 at 12:57, I would be the first to agree on the importance of good time management and organization. Indeed I have recommended your books to many colleagues and they are getting pretty bored with me going on about them.<br><br>However I still feel that good time management and organization in itself is not enough, and this is born out with experience over many years with my students, and my peer group at university.<br><br>I see many students who have outstanding time management and organizational skills. They are always on time for lectures and tutorials, have timetabled what they will do when with clear targets, hand in beautifully organized and presented assignments on time and so on. Yet they never seem to amount to much in the long term, and lose their way in trying to find out what they want to do. They do not seem to be particularly happy. <br><br>There are also students who are chaotic as anything, are always late and produce scrappy work. They have no time management system, or idea of what they will do when. But they have very clear cut goals and through sheer determination and persistence often achieve those goals and ultimately are more successful, though probably no happier.<br><br>I see the same with colleagues. Some are very organized and reliable. They get given more and more tedious jobs because everyone knows that these will be done on time to a high standard. However they are not rewarded for this. These people rightly often feel frustrated because their time management skills are being taken advantage of.<br><br>There are others with clear cut ambitious goals who ignore everything else, are hopelessly disorganized, late for anything that does not involve their single minded priorities and generally a pain to work with. However, often, again through sheer single-mindedness they achieve their goals. They are not happier though, since they are highly stressed and discover in their 50s that those goals weren't necessarily what they wanted to do with their lives.<br><br>So, I would say, good time management is important, but if you don't have a clear idea of what you want, and what you will do with the time it frees up, it doesn't necessarily give a positive answer to your question earlier above<br><br>" did you have a good year, did you enjoy it, were you satisfied with what you achieved? and so on."</div>

<div class="content">Jaroslav, I think you're describing perfection which doesn't exist. You're talking about someone who has the "right" goals, ultra-efficient time management, and who is also happy. I also think you're describing personality differences which aren't going to change no matter what goals or time management approach is chosen. I have a friend who is very organized. She doesn't seem to come up with big goals, but when I do and when I convince her she ought to pursue them, she can lay out a plan to get them done. Meanwhile I am on to the next thing and am thankful for her reminders of what the next step toward the previously adopted goal is.<br><br>IMO when people are obsessed with finding the perfect TM approach, the right goals, and perpetual happiness, they are looking for something that can't be found in the physical realm and certainly not in AF.</div>

<div class="content">It just seems to me that the situations you describe Jaraslov, are people who are going after the pot at the end of the rainbow - not necessarily enjoying the process?  There's nothing more important in my mind than going after goals where there's something you love about the process of achieving them.  No effort is wasted then.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Dear Mel and Jacqueline,<br><br>I think you may be taking my last post out of context. I am not looking for perfection or describing a particular class of ideal person. I was simply responding to Mark's comment above that<br><br>"Being able to manage your time effectively has a huge effect on your quality of life quite independent of what your goals are."<br><br>and saying that in my experience this unfortunately often isn't the case and goals are not independent of the means of achieving them. It seems to me that Jacqueline you are largely agreeing with this view when you say<br><br>"there's nothing more important in my mind than going after goals where there's something you love about the process of achieving them."<br><br>since this implies that having suitable goals is important and just having the right tool (eg a good time-management system) for achieving goals is not enough to make you happy. Its the interaction between goals and process that is the key, and many people need as much guidance with setting goals as with providing them with a better process.<br><br>As a teacher, I find my role is increasingly to say "OK, what are we trying to achieve here" which often makes the way of finding a solution much clearer rather than merely showing students how to solve a pre-set problem.</div>

<div class="content">I have been standing back watching this thread evolve and am struck by how it has worked itself right back to the earlier discussions about efficiency vs. effectiveness, planning vs. not planning, goals vs. no goals and now, even happiness.  Fascinating ;-)<br><br>Jaroslov questions:  "... I agree that the range of what we can do has immensely expanded with technological development and we now have far more freedom and choice. But how many of us ... know how to use this freedom wisely and to our benefit. Or to put it bluntly, does it make us happier?"<br><br>I think that before one can consider how to achieve happiness one has to define it … for oneself.  (Note that I am not saying that one has to define it before it can be achieved, clearly many people are happy and have no clue why.  I'm saying that if one wants to deliberately choose to be happy, or to change unhappiness to happiness, one must first define what it is one is after.)<br><br>Does productivity ensure happiness?  I think not.  One can be the award winning widget producer at one's factory and blow one's weekly pay at the local bar (pub?) getting drunk to forget one's misery.  That state is almost our icon of the human toll of the early industrial era.  (And note that is where productivity measurement, time and motion studies, and all of that had its heyday.)<br><br>Does choice ensure happiness?  Similarly, I think not.  Choice without some personal standard by which to choose almost guarantees frustration.  OTOH, lack of choice can also frustrate us.<br><br>My conclusion here is that neither productivity nor choice has meaningful impact on our happiness unless we define goals for ourselves and have a methodology to achieve our goals.  IOW, the perfect time management system will only get us SOMEWHERE faster … but if we don't want to get there in the first place, what's the point?  Having infinite choice likewise is not helpful if we don't have some means of choosing a path that will get us to our own personal nirvana.<br><br>Once again, I am not saying that no one who does not consciously choose goals and personal standards is doomed to misery.  I am saying that if one is not already sure of ones path, then the only way to consciously find that path is through conscious deliberation.  Clearly there are some who just always knew what they wanted.  Star athletes often report that they only ever wanted to be athletes.  Great musicians were born humming a tune.  Great artists were never without a Crayola in their hands to decorate the walls.   But some of us are interested in many things and so have the dilemma of choice … and  so must have some way to choose … and focusing on the best time management system to get things done more efficiently does not help with that need.  Indeed, it can make the situation worse.<br><br>Jarsolov further notes: "…  (for them, if the information cannot be found on the web in 5 minutes, it does not exist). Yet, most of my colleagues and I feel that the quality and originality of what we were doing 30 years ago was much higher (even if the quantity was lower)."<br><br>I see this as analogous to having a more efficient time management system without first setting one's goals.  It seems to me that much of what passes for thinking these days is simply regurgitating what others have said.  It has become so easy to find what someone has said about something on the web and post a link.  That is not bad in itself, but much of what has been posted on the net is crap by "experts" who are only experts because they have manufactured that reputation for themselves.<br><br>I remember reading about some of the "debates" between Jefferson and Adams in their later years (after their feud had subsided).  One would write a thoughtful letter posing some ideas.  He would send it off through the mails, by horse, and it would arrive possibly weeks later for the other to read.  That person would then chew on the ideas for some weeks more, then write a thoughtful reply … which in turn would go by horse and arrive weeks later.  One can see that process as intolerably and wastefully slow ... or part of the process that led to thoughtful development of profound ideas.<br><br>I see the short attention span of today's culture to be problematic.  I don't think it is conducive to thinking or a high quality of work.  OTOH, it may simply be that we have not found our way yet … it may take some more years for us to learn to deal with the faster flow of information and instantly available access.  The jury is not in on that one yet.<br><br>Mark replied to the question of choice: "Today is like going into a restaurant with a 40 page menu of stuff all of which sounds fantastic. You are faced with a huge amount of choice, but in the end you still have to whittle it down to what you can eat in one meal."<br><br>I'm not sure how that addresses the point.  Yes, we have more choice but still need to reduce it to only a few items, and yes, a system to help us choose is a good thing.  But the system to choose depends on some input from us about what we like to eat, what our health requirements are, what our financial status is, what our dinner partner might like, etc.  Those are the kinds of choices that require some standards by which to measure.<br><br>If I have diabetes, I'm going to want to avoid certain foods in favor of others ... if I am overweight, I'll avoid other things.  I do not use a mindless system whereby only eat white foods, or those begging with the letter "Q".   Likewise, if I'm saving to pay for a new car, I'll probably pick a cheaper meal than if I'm out to impress a date and feel that I should hang the expense.  To make choices requires standards of choice.<br><br>To bring this directly to AutoFocus, the items on my list are not there out because of some random process.  I chose to put them on the list in the first place.  Likewise, I periodically remove things I decide no longer contribute to the support of some goal.  AF may be a largely mechanical system, but nothing gets on the list that I don't consciously put there.<br><br>Mark further notes: "Being able to manage your time effectively has a huge effect on your quality of life quite independent of what your goals are. The stress and misery caused by having huge backlogs and a record of failure to carry things through is enormous."<br><br>It certainly does, and that is a point much overlooked on our conversations here.  It is why I posted some time ago about Thomas Leonard and his ideas about "tolerations".  OTOH, I think it cuts both ways … one can make the argument that managing your time effectively without having clear goals is much less helpful than doing so having such goals.  What good does it do me to be highly efficient in my garden if what I want to do with my life is to cure cancer?  I really ought to be working in the lab, not in the garden!<br><br>And continuing: "Your time management capability also affects the goals you take on. If you know that you are unlikely to be able to handle a difficult or challenging project, then you are unlikely to take the risk of choosing such a project in the first place. Being able to trust yourself to carry through vastly expands the range of things which you are willing to take on."<br><br>I could not agree more … and I think this idea also ought to have more prominence in our discussions here.  And yet, there are those who optimize efficiency and simply stop there … they never take on difficult and challenging projects because they don't WANT anything from life.  They become super efficient at doing not much at all.  (I recall in the book "The Double Helix" Francis Crick was described as a person who flitted from one problem to the next and was not able to focus on completing his doctorate.  Yet his focus on the problem he wanted to solve led him to be one of the three (IIRC) people to break the code.  It could be argued that he really ought to have been writing his thesis and not wasting time chasing down some illusive ghost.)<br><br>Jaroslov observes: "I see the same with colleagues. Some are very organized and reliable. They get given more and more tedious jobs because everyone knows that these will be done on time to a high standard. However they are not rewarded for this. These people rightly often feel frustrated because their time management skills are being taken advantage of."<br><br>I once had a boss who was a brilliant technician.  He was trying to get ahead and when his boss moved on he was passed over in favor of someone who was much less technical but more into the management culture.  That very day he (literally) threw his computer terminal into his trash can and never touched a terminal again.  He was quickly promoted.  LOL ;-)  It certainly made the point clear to me!  It is not the most productive who are rewarded … they are often only used and discarded.<br><br>And continuing: "So, I would say, good time management is important, but if you don't have a clear idea of what you want, and what you will do with the time it frees up, it doesn't necessarily give a positive answer to your question earlier above: " did you have a good year, did you enjoy it, were you satisfied with what you achieved? and so on." <br><br>I'm frankly at a loss as to why this seems to be such a polarizing debate.  When last I was discussing this Mark commented that we were agreeing using different language … but somehow the debate about goals seems to be alive and well ;-)<br><br>Mark comments later: "I'm wondering how you got the idea from my post that I thought that time management and organization were enough by themselves - especially as I specifically said that the quality of one's time management and organization affects both your likelihood of achieving your goals, and the goals you are able to trust yourself to take on."<br><br>I'm so confused.  Mark seems to be agreeing that goals are important while contending that they are pretty much a poor cousin to an efficient time management system.  I may be dense, but I simply can't figure this one out.  In my view of things one FIRST chooses goals, then SECONDLY aligns actions with goals through a system of time management.  If we all agree that goals are necessary, why does the debate about it continue?<br><br>As I say … I'm so confused. <br><br>As if I were not confused enough, Me thenl adds: "IMO when people are obsessed with finding the perfect TM approach, the right goals, and perpetual happiness, they are looking for something that can't be found in the physical realm and certainly not in AF."<br><br>I'm not sure where the statement about "perpetual happiness" is found.  I think that what was stated was that happiness does not follow from efficiency if one does not have goals that lead to happiness.  (Or words to that effect.)<br><br>Jacqueline then elaborates: "It just seems to me that the situations you describe Jaraslov, are people who are going after the pot at the end of the rainbow - not necessarily enjoying the process? There's nothing more important in my mind than going after goals where there's something you love about the process of achieving them. No effort is wasted then."<br><br>I'm not sure about rainbows and pots, but clearly goals are driven by one's personal definition of happiness.  Mozart did not become a musician because he thought his picture would look neat in modern encyclopedia … he composed music because he could not imagine doing anything else.  I do think that some people are out for the pot of gold, but I doubt that they ever find it.<br><br>Jaroslov attempts some integration with: "... this implies that having suitable goals is important and just having the right tool (eg a good time-management system) for achieving goals is not enough to make you happy. Its the interaction between goals and process that is the key, and many people need as much guidance with setting goals as with providing them with a better process.<br><br>As a teacher, I find my role is increasingly to say "OK, what are we trying to achieve here" which often makes the way of finding a solution much clearer rather than merely showing students how to solve a pre-set problem."<br><br>Exactly.  I'm not sure how one can give priority to either goals or methodology.  Neither one is sufficient … both are necessary.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Wow! I think that must definitely qualify as the longest AF post to date! :-)<br><br>If you look at the term "job satisfaction" it is generally something most people can relate to as a concept.  To have job satisfaction you will generally be in a job you want to be in, and doing something you enjoy and which you find fulfilling to a degree.  There will always, in any job, be some areas you don't enjoy, but if you believe you have job satisfaction then those annoyances are accepted as being of less value than the overall benefits.<br><br>If you look at the term "life satisfaction" in the same way, I think that is probably a pretty fair description of how people would view happiness.  It is not necessarily about goals and targets but how you feel about what you are doing in life, whether you feel fulfilled, whether you enjoy life, and where you believe that the things you don't enjoy are worth retaining in your life for whatever reason you made the choices that allowed them into your life in the first place. <br><br>Getting to that point may not be easy, but who said anything worth having came easily?  Of course there are exceptions but that is a whole other debate .... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>You Said: "If you look at the term "life satisfaction" in the same way, I think that is probably a pretty fair description of how people would view happiness."<br><br>I'm not so sure about that.  "Satisfaction" seems to be aiming a bit low, don't you think.  Would not "joy" be closer to what we want from life?<br><br>You said: "It is not necessarily about goals and targets"<br><br>Again, I'm so confused.  What is it about the very word "goals" that seems to put terror in people's hearts?  LOL ;-)  It is as if we are bending over backward to find some other word to use so as to avoid the dreaded "G" word.  ;-)<br><br>You said: "... but how you feel about what you are doing in life, whether you feel fulfilled, whether you enjoy life, and where you believe that the things you don't enjoy are worth retaining in your life for whatever reason you made the choices that allowed them into your life in the first place."<br><br>And that is just another way to describe goals!  I know MY goals certainly come from a list of things I think I'll enjoy or will make me feel fulfilled.  I know that MY goals include a list of things I don't want in my life.  The actions I put on MY AF list (or into any previously or subsequently used time management system) are chosen based on my wanting and not wanting (respectively) those things ... those goals.<br><br>For a trivial example:  I have company over this weekend.  I did a bunch of house cleaning and came across my trusty ice cream maker.  I love ice cream and I can really make a mean batch of strawberry.  It is the heat of summer right now and nothing will taste better than a nice batch of cold creamy strawberry ice cream.  That was what I WANTED and DESIRED and seemed as if it would make me FEEL GOOD and and allow me to ENJOY LIFE!  (At least for a few moments this weekend!  ;-)<br><br>So I set a GOAL:<br><br>"Make a batch of strawberry ice cream for my guests."<br><br>Then I made a list of REQUIREMENTS and ACTIONS for this PROJECT:<br><br>- Dust off and wash Ice Cream Maker (Done)<br>- Put chilling drum in freezer over night to freeze (Done)<br>- Buy strawberries (Done)<br>- Buy cream (Done)<br>- Check that I have adequate sugar on hand (Done)<br>- Check that I have vanilla on hand (Done)<br>- Check that I have lemon juice on hand (Done)<br>- Check that I have recipe book for the maker (YIKES ... Can't find it!!!)<br>- Go on line to Cuisinart site to get a PDF of the book<br>- - No PDF but they had a listing of the recipe (Done)<br>- Marinate the strawberries in lemon juice.  (by 4:00 pm -- Gotta get cracking on this one)<br>- Mix up the other things two hours later<br>- Run the machine<br>- Put ice cream in freezer until desired<br><br>Now there you have a DESIRE, a GOAL, and a PLAN with ACTIONS to support the previous.  What problem can there be to acknowledging that this is goal setting and planning?  No, I did not actually even write any of that down.  I ran through it all in my head and it is unfolding as I intended.  But that does not make it any less of a goal and a plan.<br><br>Tonight I'll be sitting around the family room eating cold creamy strawberry ice cream as my wife and her brother jam on the guitar to the tunes of the 80's.  Life is sweet!  (And so is ice cream!  ;-)  And my planning will make it so.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>While I take your point about "joy" being what we want from life the term "life satisfaction" was meant to convey the overall impression in the same way as "job satisfaction", not to use "satisfaction" as a rather bland measure of quality.<br><br>I do think it is still a matter of semantics - I do have goals and targets, I just don't necessarily call them that, not for any great psychological reason or fear factor, just that I don't look at them in as fixed a way as I suspect you do.  That's not to say I don't plan, that's not to say I don't have goals, just that I don't sit down and ask myself where I am in relation to my goals every day or so.  I guess I know the path I am on, and if it is the "right" path then I will happily travel it until I come to a fork in the road or some obstacle.  At that point I then take action, to change direction or to clear the obstacle.  It feels that I could waste a lot of energy crossing bridges before I reach them, and provided I know I am on the right path I would rather expend my energy in travelling that path.  Of course if I do not believe I am on the right path, or am unsure, then I will definitely stop and identify what path I do want to be on. <br><br>Oh, and I'm sorry Mike, but your Action List above is incomplete - you forgot the steps to investigate shipment of an extra refrigerated batch to England ......... :-)  You do realise everyone reading this thread is now craving Strawberry Ice Cream .... :-(</div>

Basically, I define things so that I know what I mean by what I'm thinking.  A goal is a goal because ... well because it is a goal.

I have yearly planning sessions and monthly and daily, etc.  All I do on a daily basis is see if there is anything important to do that day and how much of what I've planned to do I can actually get done.

I don't expend energy on crossing bridges in advance.  I do plan for the bridges to be sure I'm ready to cross when I get there, but I always get to the bridge ... that is why I plan ... to know in advance that I'll need to cross a bridge.  Otherwise, I'd always be parked on the side of the road looking for pontoons or something ;-)<br><br>Honestly, it takes no energy at all.<br><br>You said: "Oh, and I'm sorry Mike, but your Action List above is incomplete - you forgot the steps to investigate shipment of an extra refrigerated batch to England ......... :-) You do realise everyone reading this thread is now craving Strawberry Ice Cream .... :-("<br><br>ROTF ;-)  One of my most fun "investments" was that ice cream maker.  We got a cheaper one when we were married.  It involved putting ice and salt in a bucket and was a mess.  At least it did not need to be hand cranked ... but it did make good ice cream.  The Cuisinart is a dream.  You put the drum in the freezer over night and so don't need the ice and salt to make cold.  You mix ingredients, put them in the frozen drum, and turn it on for 25 minutes.  Easy peasy ;-)  BTW, my strawberries are macerating in the sugar and lemon juice now.  In about two hours I'll start the machine and about a half hour later will be comatose from sugar overload!  I mean, when it comes to real ice cream or real mashed potatoes, forget about diet!!!

<div class="content">Good Morning Again Will,<br><br>And thanks for that great chuckle in the other thread.

It is about how one approaches all of one's tasks all of one's life.<br><br>Continuing: "I struggle to back this up, as the quotes have aquired a twee patina over the years, but there's something in them nevertheless:<br><br>"There is no way to happiness: happiness is the way"<br>"It's not winning or losing: it's how you play the game"<br>"t is better to travel hopefully than to arrive."<br><br>Yes, I get that sentiment.  OTOH, once you get past the fluff in that kind of greeting card philosophy, you find some pretty hard questions have to be asked in order to make any sense of them.  They are all metaphorical, of course.  And in order to be useful, one has to resolve the metaphor in some sensible way.  Life is not REALLY a journey ... it is actually a state of being.  In order to continue that state of being one must experience the world and act within it.  Upon closer examination we observe that what one experiences influences how one acts and how one acts influences what one experiences.  So it really does matter how one approaches one's daily tasks.  I can tell you that my personal experience that there is something above and beyond simply accomplishing a task well.  I get an additional feeling of having done it according to my plan.  If I hit an obstacle and get over it because I foresaw the possibility and planned for it ... I get something positive from THAT experience.  Had I just "lucked out", I'd feel relief, but not competence.<br><br>You said:  "Statements of the blindingly obvious to some, weak minded, woolly hatted anathema to others. I think the others are missing something important."<br><br>Or perhaps they really have gotten it and seen how empty they are?  I'm all for a well turned phrase.  I think poetry can communicate more information more efficiently than prose.  But I know that my job is not done until I unravel the rhyme and metaphor and ask what is REALLY underneath it all.  Those who wander the world starry-eyed filled with fortune cookie philosophy are apt to fall into open man holes!  IOW, use the stuff printed on gum wrappers to hold the idea in mind ... but be damned sure you can express the idea in simple English and can defend it logically.<br><br>You said: "A life of joyful purpose is it's own reward."<br><br>Yeah, but does that not contradict what you have been saying about taking action without planning ahead?  "What purpose?  I don't need no stinking purpose!  I've got stars in my eyes.  Wind in my sales.  A good compass and my course set on the north star.  I've got ... yaddeyadeda!"  LOL ;-)<br><br>A pleasure exchanging ideas with you always, Will.</div>

<div class="content">Fascinating discussion!  <br><br>I do agree with Will about happiness being more about attitude than achievement - there is a lot of truth in that statement.  Abraham Lincoln once said "Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be" and there is a definitely an element of choice in how we react to things.  That is not to say we enjoy everything but attitude counts for a lot.<br><br>I feel the metaphor of life being a journey is a good one and, for me at least, sums up pretty well my take on things.  I was thinking about planning this morning and whilst there are some projects, goals, targets, call them what you will, that I feel uncomfortable about until I have a more formulated plan, that is not a guiding factor in my life.  If I go on a long journey I don't plan every step of the way; I will have an overview but will probably not plan out each day's route in any detail until the day before.  A few years ago I had to drive from Dallas to Chicago to Indianapolis to Cincinnati to New York to Washington and back to Dallas in the space of about 10 days.  This was before Sat Nav and all I had was a Road Atlas.  I took each day at a time - I chose my route to the next stage the day before, and my detours were dictated primarily by what I felt like eating or which hotel was available to stop at at around the right time of evening.  That minimal level of planning - and in a way expectation - made for a pretty relaxed journey and allowed for pleasant diversions, like the fact that I had time to stop at a small independent motel in the Blue Ridge Mountains rather than a standard Holiday Inn or similar.<br><br>Mike, it seems to me that planning is what is important to you - is that correct?  For me, if I don't plan in detail, I will feel a varying level of discomfort, according to my perceived importance of the project and certainly I will want to plan some things in a lot of detail.  Some things absolutely need to be planned - and to the nth degree - but I like to have an element of spontaneity available to me.  If I needed to be in Chicago for a meeting on Wednesday and had all of Tuesday to get there, I would work from the basis of Journey = x hours, time available = y hours, therefore I can afford to spend up to x-y hours stopping to look at things that catch my interest (or use that time for meeting planning, or keep it as a buffer in case of breakdown or emergency).   If I meticulously planned every hour, any deviation from that plan would cause me anxiety.<br><br>Does that make sense? I guess for all of us it is getting the right balance between spontaneity and planning that works for us.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>I plan and the level of detail as well as the level of strict adherence to the plan varies.  On a road trip such as you describe, I'd have it all planned out.  BUT, I'd build in slack time so that if I wanted to change the plan on the fly I could do it.  But again once I changed the plan, I'd have a way to get back to the plan or at least stay on track.<br><br>For a friends wedding I went to Bangkok, Thailand, not speaking the language nor even having a hotel.  I stopped over in Japan and had to find the name of a hotel in a flight magazine ad so they would let me off the plane.  The Japanese DEMAND that you plan these things ;-)  The only thing I had planned about that trip was the duration and the date of the full solar eclipse I could see from Bangkok which I would not miss for all the world.<br><br>The only prep was to haunt the web and talk to people about hotel and travel experience so I had some general ideas about what I would do.  Oh, and I did buy a Japan rail pass in advance ... in the U.S. where it is cheaper.  The only hard dates were the wedding date and my flight home.  The rest was open to serendipity.  But then nothing more was required and I had no information I could use to plan.  I did know of a week long cooking school I wanted to attend but I could not get firm dates and when I got there I found it would have gotten in the way of the wedding.</div>

<div class="content">Holy cow! This thread was so long I needed a goal and a TM approach to get through it all. ;-)<br><br>Mike, you said (a long time ago lol):<br>"As if I were not confused enough, Me thenl adds: "IMO when people are obsessed with finding the perfect TM approach, the right goals, and perpetual happiness, they are looking for something that can't be found in the physical realm and certainly not in AF."<br><br>I'm not sure where the statement about "perpetual happiness" is found. I think that what was stated was that happiness does not follow from efficiency if one does not have goals that lead to happiness. (Or words to that effect.)"<br><br>That statement comes from my observation that the reason most people are dissatisfied with their goals, their TM, and their lives is because they believe happiness should be continual. IOW, many appear to think that if they just choose the right goal (often they're searching for the one biggie) or the right spouse, or the right job, etc. they will never be unhappy for any extended period of time. Once unhappiness comes (and it always does!), they're convinced they've made the wrong choice in one of these areas. In my experience, happiness is fleeting. Joy is the only thing that can last for in my definition it is independent of circumstances and can even coexist with grief. <br><br>What if Michael Jordan wasn't happy playing basketball? What if Jonas Salk didn't much care for developing a vaccine? Would we then say that they had chosen the "wrong" goals? IMO there is more to life than happiness. I believe very much in goal setting and planning and enjoy these processes very much, but I believe in life purpose which for me is even more important and all-encompassing than goals. I'm not suggesting that I can determine anyone else's life purpose; I certainly can't! But having a faith-driven life purpose makes it easier for me to set goals and plan to achieve them while enduring the times when I'm not happy at all--like right now for example! ;-)<br><br>Mike, you said (I'm too lazy to copy and paste - sorry) that setting a goal that you achieve with proper planning allows you to feel competent. That's obviously quite important to you, but do you allow that there are those who don't much care about feeling competent? Feeling competent happens to be very important to me as well, but I've known many people for whom competence is a very weak motivator. <br><br>Hope I didn't confuse you further. :-) There is also the issue of having weak links between tasks and goals. For example, I have all sorts of housekeeping tasks on my AF list. What is the goal? To keep my house clean? Why again? LOL Is that the right goal? No, because honestly it doesn't motivate me. My real goal is not be stressed out or embarrassed because of mess. Ugh. My goal right now is to quit typing nonsense and enjoy a movie with my family.<br><br>All the best to you very competent goal setters out there who are hopefully having a happy weekend!!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim,<br><br>You said: "I don't think there is any disagreement about the necessity of goals.

Well, maybe not THAT many ;-)<br><br>You said: "What if I have five goals, and all of them are good, but it's not really practical to go after all of them?

You already have the goals, now it is a question of how you allocate your time to achieving  them.  One option is to work them one at a time.  At the other end is to work them all a little bit at a time.  Then there is everything between.<br><br>You said: "This can be further complicated by the degree to which the goals have been clearly articulated.

We just have a general idea. So, how do I choose which of the five goals to pursue, if some are well-articulated and others aren't? "<br><br>I would say that a not well-formed goal is not a goal at all … it is a wish or a dream.  One can only achieve goals that are well-formed … those that are in the wish/dream stage can't be started on until they are completely defined.<br><br>I can hear you saying now ;-) "Well, what if I don't know enough yet to define the goal completely?"  Well, then you redefine the goal to something interim.  You don't know enough to "Climb Mt. Everest", but you can set the goal: "Learn about mountain climbing".  Once you have achieved that you are in a position to define the goal: "Climb Mt. Everest", or something possibly leading up to it.  Or maybe bag the whole thing (based on your new understanding) as a dream you once had but was foolish.<br><br>You said: "And then again, goals can change over time, as life experience, values, priorities, and circumstances are all changing. At what point does an idea become an aspiration, and an aspiration become a goal?"<br><br>I guess it is all in how you define the terms.  For myself, I define a GOAL as a desire that is well-formed so that it can be achieved.  You are right, things change over time.  But I would not put it the way you did.  It is not that the goal is changing, it is that it may cease to be a goal.  Or a new goal may come into being.  Or a goal may be completed … or abandoned.  What defines it as a GOAL is its structure.  IOW, my goal to "Climb Mt. Everest" might be your DREAM to "Climb Mt. Everest" or your feeling that anyone who wants to do that is loony.  "Climb Mt. Everest" is nothing, in and of itself.  It is how we structure it for ourselves that makes it what it is.<br><br>You said: "You can't "choose" a goal until you can articulate what that goal is, and how it balances in priority with all your other goals. <br><br>How do you deal with that? "<br><br>I deny it ;-)  You can have a goal but not work to achieve it -- so long as in principle you have the intention to achieve it when certain well-defined conditions are met.  That is part of what a well-formed goal is made up of.  The priorities you have are not part of the goal, but part of how you manage your time to allocate it to the accomplishment of the goal.  Personally speaking, I have a number of "interests" ranging from wishes and dreams to goals to projects to actions on my current list which lead to some of those goals.  Some of my dreams may become goals.  Some not.  Some actions may move me toward the completion of goals I'm working on.  Some may be abandoned along the way.  As you say, life changes.<br><br>You said: "I suppose one way is to make it a habit of calling it a "goal" only when it's clearly articulated and fits all the SMART criteria.

"<br><br>Not so much.  If I want to "Climb Mt. Everest" and put that on my list as an entry, what I am REALLY saying is: "Think about what I might have to do to Climb Mt. Everest and decide if it is something I really want to do."  So that is not a goal to climb Mt. Everest but a goal to learn about mountain climbing.  And since that is so simple, it barely qualifies as a goal … it is more of a "project" which may or may not lead to more things.  And the first action I might take is "Go to the bookstore" and then I'm off and running.  I still maintain that if I decide to actually commit to climbing Mt Everest, I'm going to plan that big time.  In fact, you can't even talk about getting on a team without having demonstrated that you have a BIG plan and have followed it successfully to a certain point.<br><br>You said: "For myself, I have so many incompatible goals and interests, and it is so difficult to sort them out and decide how to prioritize them, that the SMART approach doesn't work very well except in very limited and specifically defined contexts. But the Autofocus method of goal-setting has really done wonders. It's helped me sort out what is really most important."<br><br>I can only suggest that you form the goals well and then put the implementation into your time management system and allocate resources from that vantage  point.  SMART does not have anything to do with WHEN you will start a goal.  Well, it has just a bit to do with it if you define it that way.  But you could define a SMART goal to "Climb Mt. Everest by XX/XX/XXXX … this will take 1 year of research, 5 years of conditioning, and as many as 3 years to get on a team.  It will take 10 years to save the money  so if I want to do it before I'm too old to accomplish it, based on my current age I need to START the process by January of next year or I'll have to forget it."  So now you have a SMART goal and you know what you have to do from a time management perspective to get it done.  You can choose to do it or not, but if you do, you have a well-formed goal to work on.<br><br>Just my thinking on it.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike,<br><br>Regarding your Mt Everest example -- Yes, that kind of planning is useful and has it's place.  But I don't find it useful as a general-purpose planning tool for sorting out all my different goals (and wanna-be goals) -- and making it into a requirement before calling something a goal just doesn't work for me.<br><br>I compare it to the GTD requirement to always define a "next action".   While at first it seemed interesting and useful, the "next action" requirement was enough to stop me from using GTD effectively, since it added so much processing overhead to the system.    With AF, I just write down the task as it occurs to me, and usually that's enough.  A few tasks might get rephrased or rewritten down the line, but for most tasks, it's enough to have the "rough draft".<br><br>For general goals (whether "life goals" or "annual goals" or "what am I going to make for dinner" goals), I think it works the same, at least for me.  SMART is nice, and SMART is a very useful discipline, but making SMART into a hard requirement before I can call it a goal, is just too much overhead and gets in my way.  Processing goals with AF the same way we process tasks with AF -- writing down the "rough draft" version and not worrying about it overmuch, unless you decide it's useful to -- really seems very effective.  For me, it's the very first time I've found *anything* that is so effective and so universally applicable.<br><br>But hey, if SMART goals work for you, and unSMART stuff gets in your way, then make your goals SMART!   I don't think there's really any essential conflict here.  I just don't think SMART is always necessarily the most useful approach.  At least for me.  :-)    But that doesn't mean I think planning is wrong or any such nonsense.</div>

Some of my dreams may become goals. Some not."   It is those very things that AF enables me to define.<br><br>Whilst I may have often felt that I "ought" in some way to have a set of clearly defined goals and to know that I was "on track", it has always felt right to me to be as sure as I can be that I am on the "right" path and to use that as the guide as to what needs what level of planning.  When I started my company there were of course a number of areas that required detailed planning.  Within that business I was able to be spontaneous about what business opportunities we accepted and sometimes that changed our direction significantly.<br><br>As Seraphim says, AF handles that approach so well, enabling me to plan what needs to be planned, and to not only identify what else is on my wish list, but to know that it can be elevated at any point.  I guess my overriding "goal" or whatever anyone wants to call it, is to do my best at whatever I am doing at any point in time.  There may be times in life when what I am doing is not necessarily the result of an original goal, but down to amended choices following amended circumstances.  That does not mean that I cannot maintain my ultimate standard of "doing my best" or that I cannot continue to plan for other things, but does ensure I can deal with the here and now in addition to someday/maybe.<br><br></div>

If I'm in the middle of one and it's going quite badly, I simply change the rules a bit to get the same thing done.<br>Also, if my life seems a bit out of hand, I'll simply wake up at about 4 or 5 am and do my work session then.  There's not too much that will likely disrupt you during those hours.  Works like a charm every time........coffee makes a great work partner!  LOL!<br>Give it a go.  You'd be surprised how effective it is.  Also, when I take a break in the form of a walk or sit outside, the world is truly magnificent during these hours.  Even the creatures seem to enjoy it as the sun begins to rise.  Sometimes I'll set a goal and try to get it done 20 minutes before the sun rises.  Then cook my breakfast and eat it while watching the sun rise while listening to the birds chirping and the squirrels quarreling with each other!  LOL!  Also, in the heat of the summer, it's a great time to get labor intensive work done because it's the coolest time of the day.  Your physical energy doesn't get as spent by the heat factor.  Also, you don't have to worry about many people coming up to you and breaking your conversation with small talk and questions (many people will pick your brain just to avoid reading it for themselves....especially gardening!  LOL!)<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning<br><br>That sounds like a great idea but I struggle to be a morning person.  I've seen the dawn a couple of times recently but unfortunately before going to bed rather than after getting up :-(  Whenever I am up in time to watch the sunrise I always regret that I don't make more effort to enjoy that time of day - something else to plan into my time I think.<br><br>I am fortunate enough to live on a marina so early mornings are always special - sometimes the water is covered with mist, sometimes completely still with almost perfect reflection, sometimes forming the playground of gulls and cormorants or just a sleeping swan - magical.....</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine B<br>Again, you're preaching to the choir.  Currently my pain issues keep me perpetually sleep deprived.  (I pray for at least a 3 1/2 to 4 hour sleep chunk once in awhile). In my "previous life", I did many different shifts.  4am-noon, 10pam-6am, and almost all the different times.  Also, I usually either worked 2 jobs or took classes and took in lots of contract work.  (I hate boredom so I always kept things "alive".  In my experience, if you're REALLY INTENT on accomplishing something, you won't settle for "finding" the time, you'll CREATE it!   <br>Usually, from about 11:30 to about 7 or 8 am, you can be assured that the distractions imposes on you will be far less than during the normal bussle of day.  Just choose one or a few depending on how INTENT you really are.<br>My dad used to say "Stop pay lip service to the job"  That was his military way of teaching us that most complaining and excuse making does nothing to advance your aims.  It's funny how I can actually hear people of my past's voices "echoing" in my brain when my normal stream of thoughts keeps me stalemated.  He used to also say, "You don't  chance to find the time, you CREATE the time!"  He always had a great way of teaching us how to think and conduct ourselves.  He was big on creating your character and your own life.  He was also the guy who taught me about building flexibility into my plans.  He used to say that the opportunities of living are far more vast and compelling than I could ever imagine....but I need a trajectory of some sort to be on alert to notice them as they appeared.  He said, "If you don't have a target, you're aimless."  He always integrated play time with learning and appreciating the experience peppered with hearty laughter and great commoraderie.  He was serious when he worked and serious when he played and loved!  Although he was quiet and shy, he always had a wonderful vibrancy about him.  I think it was because he really was awed by living and cherished our free agency to create ourselves and our lives.  His youth was very hard and limited. Maybe that's why he squeezed the most out of each moment as he could....even when he read......he was appreciative!<br>Bottom line:  Chrisitne, if you really want to be or do.....create a way....or just admit that you don't and find something else that adds to you and your life.  Cull the dreaded stuff to the lowest denominator that you can get by with and still uphold your responsibilities and character traits.  Mine is 90'daily scut cap unless I'm intentionally doing extra to clear a future time.  It's YOUR ONE and ONLY LIFE (that I can positively attest to). <br>learning as I go<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I hope that my post wasn't too passionate or pedantic, but sometimes when I read your posts........it sounds like you're shooting yourself in the foot with your thinking.  It seems as though you have an intent and then talk yourself into believing that you can't do what you want to accomplish......You're highly intelligent and resourceful.....don't allow  the unsubstantiated limitations you tell yourself,  pull you away from your aims!  Use your cleverness to work in alignment with what you really want.  We all tend toward this at times.  Sometimes we need to counter our shaky thinking with different thoughts that champion our aims, not inhibit not interfere with them......just a thought.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning<br><br>I do totally agree with you when you say "if you really want to be or do.....create a way....or just admit that you don't and find something else that adds to you and your life."  I really feel I've done that with the areas primarily under my control - it's the areas that are not that I am struggling with currently.  I so admire the way you do get on with things despite your circumstances.  <br><br>You are right when you talk about shooting yourself in the foot with negative thinking - I've definitely done that in the past.  I really don't think I am doing that at present - on the contrary I am more likely to be told I am being unrealistic about my current circumstances :-)  And although I know folks mean well when they tell me that, it is not always helpful when I am trying everything to sort those circumstances out - and sometimes just need some physical assistance rather than sympathy.  Sympathy on it's own is a lot more likely to leave me feeling sorry for myself and I HATE that!!!<br><br>It is hard enough sometimes to accept that you cannot do all you want to do and that you do need assistance but finding that assistance is not always easy either.  I feel like I have been fighting "the system" for ever!!  I guess I am still trying to deal effectively with situations despite health issues over the past couple of months and it is not always easy to differentiate between what is currently possible for me and what is not - this is a somewhat new experience for me :-)  Having made the assumption that a lot of tiredness was just procrastination or stress when it actually had a physical cause plays havoc with your thought processes when you always believed you knew your own capabilities :-)  <br><br>Again I so admire your ability to work through these things - you are not just learning as you go but teaching as you go and I really thank you for that!  Your statement "It's tricky to recognize when it's actually happening because when under the spell, it seems so logical" really sums it up well - I know what I "should" (for want of a better word in the circumstances) be able to do based on my "normal" levels of health etc. - I know what I "feel" I can do but what is hard to identify is what I can "actually" do as things stand at present.  That is really what I am struggling to identify.  I believe I can do 100% but I feel I can only do 10%.  What I can actually do lies somewhere between, I am just not sure where.  I guess the other thing I am finding frustrating, is that, in recognising that at present I cannot do 100% and need assistance with that, finding that assistance is stressful in itself added to which I resent time spent on that which "feels" wasted as I still feel I "should" be perfectly capable of doing everything without assistance!!  <br><br>I was also quite struck by the Twitter post on Mark's site today which said "If you were to act consistently in your own best interests, how would life be different?"  That question may not in itself be difficult to answer (I can easily think of a number of things I would change) but I suspect that few of us would ever wish to only act in our own interests - there will always be others we want to include in our consideration of what we do.  That's not to say that there aren't times when we need to put ourselves first in order to able to continue to support those dependant upon us but that is not always easy or even possible.<br><br>Thanks so much for your sage advice - I REALLY don't want to come over as feeling sorry for myself and I WILL get there - maybe just not as quickly as I would have expected a few months back ........ :-)</div>

Selfishly grabbing things without regard to other people's feelings is not in our own best interests.

<div class="content">re Mel's comment: "What if Michael Jordan wasn't happy playing basketball?" <br><br>That actually happened at least twice, he staged two comebacks. He regained his passion for basketball in the time he was away. At one point he tried to play baseball because of it's significance to him and his dad who was killed. He wasn't an exceptional baseball player, but I'm willing to bet he had a meaningful journey. He left in his prime, which everybody hated. In his second comeback he came back way past his prime, which again, a lot of people hated since it might have tarnished his 'legacy'. In both cases he listened to his own drive. <br><br>Goals are interesting, they can definitely cut both ways. The power is in the way they are defined and the purpose on which they are made. Goals set to achieve results often don't give real satisfaction, like chasing after something and being disappointed when you have reached it. <br><br>On the other hand, one of the reasons things don't get done, whether they are juicy goals or trivial ones, is when they are not concrete or measurable. I think there have been a few citations on the forums here linking to the research done on students who were tracked on their performance when comparing abstract or fuzzy goals to clear, concrete and achievable goals. The result were dramatic, the latter group performed much much better, while the first group didn't achieve much of anything. <br><br>So it's interesting when you think about goals that are meant to enrich our lives. Set them fuzzy and they aren't like to happen. Set them unrealistic or shallow and you have a recipe for disappointment. If you don't set them at all, depending on your life style, you're likely to stay in your comfort zone. <br><br>The interesting thing is, we're learnt to make are goals 's.m.a.r.t.' but the ones that really make a difference are usually fuzzy, unrealistic and unobtainable. <br><br>Take for instance the goal of 'world peace'. If you really think about it, it's an insane goal. What would success look like in that scenario? Everybody bending to your will of being 'peaceful' is not likely and you might even say born out of a desire to control (which is the reason violence exists!). What is the definition of peace anyway? I do think the Gandhi's of the world believed in a different 'world peace' than the example I'm giving now. Maybe a world peace that is already here, simply because you choose to tune solely into only the things that mirror that reality. In that case you don't have to make any 'effort', it's just a matter of focusing your attention, which means the goal is attained by merit of the intention. <br><br>But these type of goals like striving world peace, or being the best dancer, or ending world hunger are incredibly powerful catalysts of behaviour and experience, even though they can be considered abstract, unobtainable and unrealistic. <br><br>Just recently I set myself a number of 's.m.a.r.t.' goals, while at first they gave me conducive pressure, I felt motivated, pulled toward and I made a lot of progress, but they subtly transformed into goals that gave me negative pressure over an amount of days. It took a while for me to realize I set the goals simply to focus my mind and enhance the process, but as soon as the goals became a weight on my shoulders, I had difficulty realizing the goals were set simply to enhance the process/journey. I had fallen into thinking I was failing a goal which created it's own resistance. I soon snapped out of it though....goals are simply aids for focusing. And life is as rich or painful as what you are focusing on. <br><br>I think Michael Neill said it in a remarkable way: "goals are meant to make you fall deeper in love with life".</div>

<div class="content">The following article refers to studies of Ariely and Steel <br><a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/01/how-to-avoid-procrastination-think.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/01/how-to-avoid-procrastination-think.php</a><br><br>I went though Ariely's book last week. It mentions a lot of interesting studies. I don't agree with all the man conclusions/suggestions though.<br><br>My professor adopted the same 'deadline' method as Ariely talks about. I hated it the first time around because that professor was the only one on campus using that type of system, I was screwed when I missed one deadline which meant I had to do the course the next year around with no way around it. But the technique does work, had my highest grade the following year. <br><br>the basic premise is that people underestimate their tendency to procrastinate and that by setting spaced 'mini' deadlines with incentives and punishments throughout a semester you can ward of procrastination and last minute work. It's a way of regularly precommitting that promotes regular work...or in MF terms a way to encourage the little and often way of working.<br><br>Now I wasn't referring to the 1953 study, but that was a very interesting article, glad you posted it! The author of the article does make a similar mistake as the guru's made however as evidenced by the title. But speakers love pulling out percentages and numbers because it draws the attention, regardless of their validity. Even when the facts are technically correct, most numbers are taken out of context and are compared to incomparable things. Even when people are using the real numbers, they are in essence manipulating it to make a point on a different subject(their point). Numbers do weird things to the reasoning of people!<br><br>Mark, are you planning on writing more articles about 'goalless' living? Sort of a paradoxical question hehe!<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>Forgive me if I've lost the thread a bit.  I've been out of this discussion for a while so I may have forgotten some things.<br><br>You said: "Mike, you said (I'm too lazy to copy and paste - sorry) that setting a goal that you achieve with proper planning allows you to feel competent."<br><br>I don't remember saying that and I can't find it in this thread (with an only very quick search.  I can say that achieving goals does enhance my sense of competence, but I don't do it for that reason.  Subtle distinction, perhaps but a real one.<br><br>You said: "That's obviously quite important to you, but do you allow that there are those who don't much care about feeling competent? Feeling competent happens to be very important to me as well, but I've known many people for whom competence is a very weak motivator."<br><br>I actually don't feel that I am motivated by competence.  I'll have to think more about this but while I do like to achieve things but achievement is not my main motivator.  At least I don't think it is.  As I say, I'll have to chew on that one.<br><br>You said: "Hope I didn't confuse you further. :-)"<br><br>No doubt you did ... I'm easily confused ;-)<br><br>You said: "There is also the issue of having weak links between tasks and goals. For example, I have all sorts of housekeeping tasks on my AF list. What is the goal? To keep my house clean? Why again? LOL Is that the right goal? No, because honestly it doesn't motivate me. My real goal is not be stressed out or embarrassed because of mess."<br><br>Yes, there are all kinds of weaker goals and things we do without really having well thought out goals.  Cleaning house as a good example.  Why do it?  Does it really represent some kind of goal?  Probably technically, but not so much in the normal sense.  I seldom think of it as a goal of its own.  It is usually supporting some other goal.<br><br>- Like to have friends over<br>- Don't like spouse nagging<br>- Enjoy the feeling of an organized space<br>- Don't like dust irritating breathing<br>- Like to impress others<br>- etc.<br><br>Regardless of the rationality of the reason, it feels to me as though cleaning only supports other things.  If I take a rock climbing course it directly supports my goal of climbing Mt. Everest.  If I go on a house cleaning binge it supports many "real" goals, as in the list above.<br><br>In any case, I don't really get much into planning these kinds of goals.<br><br>I'm not sure that clarifies anything ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine B.<br>I can't remember the whole of your post, but I'll try to reply to what I interpret as the gist of it......you stated:<br><br> I REALLY don't want to come over as feeling sorry for myself and I WILL get there - maybe just not as quickly as I would have expected a few months back ........ :-) <br><br>It's natural to feel sympathy for yourself.  You'd feel even MORE sympathy for another person slammed in the same way, yeah?  I don't know the particular nature of your health and life challenges, so I'll attempt to offer up more generalized thoughts extracted from my own experience.<br><br>It's been 8 years for me and my brain is STILL STRUGGLing with adjusting my personality to fit my new circumstances.  The main thing that keeps me either afloat or optimistic is to change my focus from brittle shoulds.  The key for me is my true to the gut intentionality towards my aims.  If you allow yourself a blanket free pass, then your courage and confidence will erode......on the other hand, I had to learn the hard way that I've got to be flexibile yet true to my intentions.  That's why I plan by the week.  <br>Example:  Tuesdays and Fridays are my accounting days.  I changed it to ROUND-UP DAYS  for all my categories.  Say on Tuesday, my pain levels are very high....I'm not going to mentally flaggelate myself over it.  Instead, I'll shoulder into something that doesn't require accurate and detailed results.  I can accomplish an hour of work to substitute it how ever I can manage it.  Mondays and Thursdays are house round-up days.   Easy.....make that my aim for the meanwhile.  If my pain abates, I can switch back over to my accounts chores.  The trick is to be SHARP on your INTENTIONS using RATIONAL assessments of what efforts you can offer toward your work.  Also, my pain doesn't lead to further injury.  My only challenge is to master my attitude and abilities around it.  IOW, withstanding pain doesn't physically threaten me, it's only painful.<br>Again, I don't know about you specifically.  If your issues are lifetime ones, then I hate to be the bearer of bad news........get used to working through chronic fatigue and chronic pain......I might take awhile to learn this.  They gave me biofeedback.  Since I was in athletics most of my life, I already knew how to push most of the pain far enough away from polluting my focus/intentions.   More bad news, even with biofeedback, you still feel it.....you're simply telling yourself that your accomplishing your aim has higher ranking than coddling the pain...........Not pretty...........but it works.<br>Most important, staying true to FLEXIBLE and RATIONAL intentions will help to keep your courage and confidence in tact which will carry you further in your life than the actual aim/goal/work that you pressed on with.   Sometimes it takes me a couple of hours to complete a 30 minute job.......I could berate myself, hate fate, etc.........Instead, I think....I'm not benching myself yet, world........I'm still in the game!  ROTFL<br>((((Christine B))))  Be kind to yourself by not being overly harsh/critical .......nor.....by being toooft<br><br></div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>The main trick is to try to stay as current/slightly ahead on the important stuff.  I treat my home upkeep and office processing as habits and background bits.  I do the maintenance in "stolen" bits of time so that my devoted work sessions are only that........not neglected maintenance stuff.  That goes a long way.....It's also great because if life offers you a surprise gift, you are at peace to enjoy it with no drag of worry/guilt.  Even if my pain is a monster, I can spread out things.  Don't laugh, but my AM habit is to make bed, allow dog to relieve herself, freshen her water, take meds, review/adjust today's aims and personal care.  Sometimes it might take FAR LONGER than the usual 30 minutes.....Do what I can....rest....do what I can....rest.....<br>TIP:  rest must be only physical. for the habituated rituals....no escape activities to dilute the intention and strength of the habit.

<div class="content">Hi learning<br><br>Thanks so much for your inspirational post.  That is so much what I am trying to do and I AM determined to beat this.  At this point I have no idea how permanent this situation will be but everything is a learning experience and I fully intend to use it as such.  And you're right - I would feel sympathy for someone else in the same situation.  I AM still getting things done - and my AF stats are a great tool for me in seeing at a glance that I AM making progress.  I may feel like I am not achieving much at present but my stats prove that I am - YAY!<br><br>It is the emotional adjustment that is hardest and you do have to learn new tricks. Of course when it has an impact on what you are able to do where other people are involved there are other areas to deal with rather than just personal inconvenience and that can be quite frustrating.<br><br>Thank goodness that AF is providing me with the tools to deal with my old procrastination habits so that I can keep on top of maintenance.  There is my "neglected maintenance backlog" still lurking (which I had expected to have cleared by now at previous progress levels) but that is still reducing - will just take longer.  And as for all of the external demands on my time, well I just have to accept certain limitations, and ensure that I can arrange alternative cover for those things I cannot do currently.  Once those things are put into place it will be easier - I'm looking forward to the time when as you say "if life offers you a surprise gift, you are at peace to enjoy it with no drag of worry/guilt."  <br><br>My "maintenance habit", as it were, is AF - that really is all I need to keep on track and by cycling between tasks that does give the ability to make progress by taking "productive rest breaks".  If I need to sleep during the day then I do so and by defining my leisure or "do nothing" sort of activities then they become tools to manage low energy times rather than guilt inducing procrastinators (or black holes as you put it).<br><br>I am learning not to be too harsh/critical of myself and not to be too easy/soft either!  Mind you I liked your original sentence before you amended it to "too easy/soft"  I liked toooft much better!  I'm going to print out a poster for my desk reminding myself - Don't be Toooft! <br><br>Right then - having had to be out by 7:30 this morning I am now off to action one of only three tasks remaining on page 47 - "Make bed!"</div>

<div class="content">Hi Learning<br><br>It's funny seeing how the content of my AF list has changed since I started. On day 1 of Beta Testing I added absolutely everything I could think of, including make bed, stack dishwasher, clean sink etc.  The interesting thing was seeing how and why tasks stood out - I've already posted about my "dishwasher experience" but the "make bed" task was also interesting in that I realised that once the bed was made the room became a sort of haven, a place to relax.   Most routine maintenance tasks don't make it back to my list, except say if I have friends round and end up with a "tidy kitchen" event to organise once they have left :-)   <br><br>I do however have a few "make bed" tasks peppered through my lists, not so much to do the task, which is generally pretty automatic (although it does get actioned from the list occasionally!) but it does remind me each time I see it of the impact on my psyche of seemingly trivial tasks.  <br><br>Of course today it was useful - to reduce my 3 remaining tasks from p47 from 3 to 2!  P47 was started on 11 March and the bed has definitely been made since that time!!!</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br>I think I was quoting you as saying that accomplishing a goal or goal-related task allows "you" to feel competent, but I meant you as in "one." You weren't personalizing it, but I suspected that feeling competent is important to you as it is to many of us. Don't mean to misquote you, especially when I didn't quote directly! ;-)<br><br>In terms of tasks where the goal is vague (e.g., housework), it seems to me that this is precisely why we often battle to get these tasks completed. Certainly there are tasks that I don't strongly associate with a goal at least consciously (e.g., showering), but such tasks are no problem as they have become automatic habits. Loading and running my dishwasher has become that for me. I couldn't go to bed without running my dishwasher any less comfortably than I can go to bed without brushing my teeth.<br><br>As you mentioned, housework can have a goal of preparing for guests. It's amazing to me how quickly I can work and how motivated I am to clean in these situations. I wonder if I need a real goal like this to keep the motivation flowing or if I can create an artificial one that would be as effective? I don't really struggle with housekeeping anymore, but I don't get tasks done as fast as I could either. <br><br>Speaking of housework and habits, I need to do some laundry and sleep. :-) Did you make any other fab desserts this weekend?</div>

Therein likes the trick ;-)  What you are basically talking about here are things like affirmations and such.  If you can convince yourself that you feel a certain way or have a certain desire, then it works.  So I imagine you can make a goal for yourself to have your house clean (just to continue the same example) so that you can invite friends over on the spur of the moment.  Then I'd guess to make it real you'd have to imagine the fun times you'd have when you were all frolicking and rollicking deep in your cups ;-)<br><br>>>> Did you make any other fab desserts this weekend? <<<<br><br>Not so much.  I'm not really a desert person (5w6 and all of that ... we are basically minimalists ;-)  From time to time I'll make the odd batch of fudge brownies or bananna muffins, but sweets don't ring my chimes.  Other than ice cream, of course.  I mean, what soulless neanderthal would not like ice cream ;-)  In any case, my lovely spouse (or SWMBO, as Will puts it ;-) is winding up the school year and we are celebrating our short time together with a cruise.  We will do some snorkeling and too many treats can make that more work than fun ;-)  She's also getting down to fighting trim as she wants to cycle the C&O Canal later this summer.  (I told you that 7's were 20 pounds in a 10 pound sack people!  ;-)  But the short of it is that it's no more ice cream for a while either as we both watch our figures!<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>Love the Haiku poems!<br><br>Mel<br><br>One trick that is good for cleaning/tidying tasks is to have a strong visualisation of the area as it would look once cleared.  Then as you look at it as is, the items out of place are just that - out of place and needing to be moved to get the picture "right".  It's strange but it makes it more like a game - instead of "sigh, I must clear xyz up" it's "hmm, now that dirty mug is in the wrong place, needs to be moved to get back to the "true" image"<br><br>It almost makes it fun - in some ways it reminds me of the famous Michelangelo qoute that when he started a sculpture he "saw" the angel in the block of marble and just chipped away everything that was not the angel.  Not that i'm saying that my clear and tidy kitchen is as beautiful as a Michelangelo sculpture ........ :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike, you said:<br>"So I imagine you can make a goal for yourself to have your house clean (just to continue the same example) so that you can invite friends over on the spur of the moment. "<br><br>I love this! I really think this could work for me. As it is, I still feel as though I need plenty of devoted cleaning time for this to happen. And you can imagine with 6 children, my house isn't always company-ready. I will give it a try.<br><br>You also said:<br><br>"In any case, my lovely spouse (or SWMBO, as Will puts it ;-) is winding up the school year and we are celebrating our short time together with a cruise.

Leave that AF list behind. ;-) Enjoy the food too!<br><br>Christine:<br><br>The visualizing how it's supposed to look is an excellent idea, too. The only problem may be my frustration with my kids messing it up all the time. LOL I like to say I'd be the most organized and productive homeschooler ever if I didn't have kids. ;-) I was thinking of you this morning and I am hoping you see your backlog continue to dwindle! I was alarmed to realize that I have 36 pages today. I am going to use a new approach to reduce that which is to work on the pages with 3 or fewer items only. The number of pages is giving me fits. :-) I'm also going to track my stats every day. I quit doing that when I stopped using Toodledo. I hope it helps my motivation!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>Hope the visualisation works - perhaps you can get the kids to visualise a section each and have it a goal to keep their section clear (and not by dumping into someone else's !!)<br><br>I'm still running at over 50 active pages but with my tandem mode it is not causing me any anxiety.  My number of o/s items is down to 378 and I genuinely feel in control of my lists.  My backlog is another matter though but the fact that I am not just keeping up with new stuff but still reducing my tasks gives me a lot of hope.  I am having to take some drastic actions as a result of my backlog issues but I just have to live with that for now.  The great thing is that I now have my backlog clearly defined with a detailed plan of action and clear targets - Mike would be proud of me :-) - so I guess I am making progress even on that front!!</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>A couple of thoughts on the house:<br><br>1) Clean enough is clean enough.  People come over to enjoy YOU, not inspect the house.  (At least you strike me as the kind of person who would attract that kind of friend.)  Just so they don't stick to the chair when they try to leave, you are probably fine!  ;-)<br><br>2) Maintenance is key.  It takes only minutes to vacuum once a day but a much longer time to do it weekly.<br><br>3) Get the right equipment.  I saw a vacuum that straps on your back so you can move like a gazelle through the house.  I've noticed the pros using such things.  Those plastic "bottles" of wet wipes (Kirkland or Lysol) are great for a quick wipe of the fixtures before people come over.  WAY faster than scrub brush and Ajax and good enough.  ;-)<br><br>4) Get the kids involved.  Each one has his area to be responsible for and gets to have friends over if his area is clean and inviting.  A life lesson as well so they will never have a problem with cleaning.<br><br>5) DO have friends over frequently.  No point having a goal if you never reach it.  Learn from the experience what is important and what is not.  (I inspect the output of the dishwasher since someone found some junk left in a cup after I ran a load.  Yuk.  I really need a new dishwasher!)  OTOH, I find that dust on the top of door frames is never noticed ;-)<br><br>Cruise:  I can hardly wait!!  We like NCL.  I do especially because they serve raw salmon with lemon, capers, onion, and tomato in the morning.  I am first at the early morning breakfast just for that.  Screw the pastry.  I gorge on the salmon!  I'm no dummy ;-) ;-)<br><br>This time we are going to Bermuda and so (since it is not a third world country) are going to skip the expensive ship sponsored excursions and go off on our own to snorkel at the public beaches.  It should be loads of fun.<br><br>Of course, my lovely 7 wife is running off to marching band practice two hours after we return.  OY!  If she does not have dozens of things lined up to do she does not feel right ;-)<br><br>But yes, I'll leave the AF list behind.  I WILL have a book and a laptop, though.  I can usually work my way through at least one book on a cruise.  I'm up while the staff are vacuuming the hall ways and polishing the brass!  ;-)  I sit on the bow of the ship, in the moonlight reading and listening to the sound of the water.  Heaven ;-)  And YES, that is so RELAXING!  (Admit it now, you were thinking it!  "Nut, does not know how to relax and have a good time."  LOL ;-)<br><br>Also, the crew are interesting at that hour.  You can get to talk to some of them for a moment and they come from everywhere.  Often, I'll look up their home town on my phone GPS (Google Earth) and they can see their village.  Makes for a fun learning experience for me and they get a kick out of it.<br><br>This time I'm going to try something slightly different as well.  I've been looking at some journaling sites devoted to travel and have some new ideas.  I like this guy:<br><br><a href="http://www.kahunna.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kahunna.net/</a><br><br>and I have struck up a bit of a conversation with him.  I like what he has done.  KEWL!  But I REFUSE to by a damn Moleskine to write in!  ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mel, my 8 y.o. loves playing with the remote on my roomba.  He vacuums the whole house just playing with it.  I can't recommend them highly enough!!!  Good times, good times... <br><br>I brought my AF list on my camping trip this last weekend and am glad I did.  I got around to a few things I might not have otherwise.  I made up a special one page list for it, and still managed to sip on a few wobbly pops, work on my tan, and read a couple of good books.  :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>What a great idea.  My only problem is that many of my rooms are simply functional and I don't think of them as galleries.  But still a great idea for the living room, perhaps.<br><br>Stick to the chair:  You think that's a joke!  LOL ;-)  It happened to me once.  Some woman had kids and no idea how to manage them and the place was covered in what I can only describe as some kind of sticky goo ... wet lolly pops? ... anyway, I literally stuck to things.  I could not wait to get out of there and shower!  Good God!!!<br><br>Roomba:  Those look great.  Do they work well?<br><br>AF List::  Not likely.  What I will do is write out a list of goals for myself for the trip and take that ... just an index card's worth.  It will be mostly reading goals as I want to use that time to do things for ME.  I mean, things I enjoy rather than things which support things that I enjoy, if you know what I mean.  "Read" rather than "Organize space so I can read."<br><br>My rule now is to take ONLY one book and work on that.  (And you have no idea how much pain that involves if you are not an ADDer like myself ;-)  I confess that sometimes I'm seduced by the ship's library.  I'll find a book I'd never think of reading but it calls to me.  Last cruise I found a book that discussed research on neuroplasticity using Tibetan Monks as study subjects.  (Along the lines mentioned in the article on attention someone posted a link to recently.)  It was pretty fascinating ... if not all that immediately useful.  I calculated how much time it would take to do enough meditation to get to that point necessary to produce the physical changes noted and it worked out to be 10 years of meditating 8 hours a day!  (Sure you've changed your brain for the better but so what?  You don't do anything with it but meditate. ;-)  But I'm sure the research will have more useful results later on.  But who knows what I may find on my next trip ;-)<br></div>
