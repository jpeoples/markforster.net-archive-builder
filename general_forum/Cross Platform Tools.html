<div class="content">There are lots of tools and methods for better organisation and time management.  (I'm looking at you, BuJo!)    There are also a number of apps on phones and a few on PC's to support these.   I'm experimenting now and will probably develop something that's a hybrid of BuJo and something else.  <br><br>I live on my (Android) phone AND my PC, so I want something cross-platform so I when I make an entry on my phone it appears on my PC and vice versa.   What are my options.   Thanks in advance.</div>

<div class="content">www.dynalist.io is an super-powered outliner with Windows, iOS, Android, and web versions.  Data is stored on the cloud.  It's very easy to implement an Autofocus type system within it, using indent to form a page (if you want; pageless systems are another option) and the Move command to re-enter something at the end.<br><br>And of course it's a spot to put all your other notes, though fancy formatting and pictures are included more as an afterthought as it's a note organizer, not a word processor.</div>

<div class="content">I also live on my phone (android) and laptop (windows). In general I've tended towards web-based apps that work on both android and windows.<br><br>1) Quick notes - Google Keep - web & android app - <a href="http://keep.google.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://keep.google.com/</a><br>2) Outliner - Checkvist - web & android mobile web - <a href="http://checkvist.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.com/</a> & <a href="http://m.checkvist.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://m.checkvist.com/</a><br>3) Calendar - MS Exchange/Outlook - web/client for windows & samsung calendar app<br>4) File sharing - Dropbox - web/client for windows & android app.<br><br>Those are my main time management and organiser tools. I'm currently undecided on productivity tools (word processing, spreadsheet, presentation). I'm using both Microsoft's online Word/Excel/Powerpoint and Google's Docs/Sheets/Slides. Both work well enough on Windows and Android.</div>
