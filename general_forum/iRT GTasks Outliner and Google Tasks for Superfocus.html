<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Today is my first full day using iRT GTasks Outliner <a href="http://www.irtgtasksoutliner.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.irtgtasksoutliner.com/</a> and Google Tasks https://mail.google.com/tasks/ig?pli=1 for Superfocus. <br><br>I was happily using Checkvist (CV) for Superfocus on my desktop/notebook until I realise that I don't really do SF when away from desktop/notebook because of limitations of CV for web mobile devices. <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1494088" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1494088</a><br><br>However, I really loved working with the collapsible outlining in CV. That leads me to iRT GTasks Outliner that claims to be "Simply the best Android Outliner". It syncs with Google Tasks, so on desktop/notebook I can access the same list, though not as "full featured" as on Android. <br><br>I'll report more of my progress with it later. I'm basically re-implementing almost exactly the method I used on CV ...</div>

<div class="content">Hello Tiger, looks interesting, however I'm still steeling myself to carry on with Toodledo on PC notebook and synchronising with Ultimate To-Do List.  My setup is working well with my Android Galaxy SII.  I just wish the Galaxy had a handwriting appl;ication similar to that even with my old WIndows Mobile 6.5 where I could scribble rough notes with the stylus.<br><br>But I enjoy reading about your experiments/developments and those of others.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger,<br><< steeling myself to carry on Toodledo >><br>Yeah, you need to "steel", or maybe even "titanium" yourself. But then renewal is good right? ;-)<br><br><< handwriting appl;ication  >><br>I think you would love Dan Brinklin's Note Taker, as he personally demo in this video, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRUy0fg6yj8" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRUy0fg6yj8</a> , but that may make you wish to get an iPad. This forum post <a href="http://www.xoomforums.com/forum/motorola-xoom-apps/237-note-taking-app-6.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.xoomforums.com/forum/motorola-xoom-apps/237-note-taking-app-6.html</a> said "when asked about an Android version, Dan Bricklin (Noter Taker HD) commented that he wants to get the backlog of features in the iPad version completed before he begins an Android port." And the rest of that Motorola Xoom thread have other handwriting apps suggestions including Handrite and Genial Writing. <br><br>An update on iRT GTask Outliner. I initially did SF on notebook via Google Task, it's workable but its outlining is always open, not collapsible. So now I'm getting myself to do SF exclusively on my Viewpad7 with iRT Gtask Outliner. On day 4, it does feel as good as Checkvist or Toodledo for SF.</div>

<div class="content">I'm continuing SF on iRT GTask Outliner at least for the full month, even though I have some inclination to go play with Thinking Space for the same purpose. :-/<br><br>Two snapshots of how I'm using iRT GTask Outliner on Viewpad7 while doing tasks on my HP notebook.<br>* <a href="http://www.smsabri.com/random/getting-everything-done/superfocus/2011-06-1515.23.54SFViewpad7hp6530bs.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.smsabri.com/random/getting-everything-done/superfocus/2011-06-1515.23.54SFViewpad7hp6530bs.jpg</a><br>* <a href="http://www.smsabri.com/random/getting-everything-done/superfocus/2011-06-1515.24.11SFViewpad7s.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.smsabri.com/random/getting-everything-done/superfocus/2011-06-1515.24.11SFViewpad7s.jpg</a></div>
