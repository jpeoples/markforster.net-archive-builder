<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>For some reason I clicked on the Amazon link and realized that it is Amazon UK.  I'm not apt to oder from them as it seems more reasonable to order from Amazon US.  I wonder if you don't want to set up a pass through for US residents so you can get a piece of that action.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>The problem is that my books are not that easily obtainable from Amazon.com so many people in the US order through Amazon.co.uk</div>

We have not gotten it yet but it does look like the wave of the future.  I don't know the mechanics of it but it seems to me that you could even self-publish in Kindle format.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I'm sure it's possible to self-publish in Kindle format. Amazon have facilities for self-publishing. It's certainly something I will be investigating for the future.</div>
