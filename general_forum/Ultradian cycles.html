<div class="content">I'm reading a book now about personal energy management. The core thesis is that to be most effective you must balance effort with relaxation. To work at a continuous pace is draining and unhealthy. The solution is to recognize biological rhythms and work with them. Expend energy when high, rest when low.  Vary exertion between hard work, pushing into fatigue, and thorough and deliberate recovery. This pattern applies to Physical life, but also to mental, emotional, spiritual energy, the same way.  These cycles appear in small and large timescales. <br><br>Having breaks recharges you and enables better decisions and more effective work - provided you put the effort in also.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting, and quite related to "little & often." I Googled "Ultradian" and found some material that goes really well with Mark's techniques:<br><br><a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/09/07/ultradians" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.43folders.com/2006/09/07/ultradians</a><br><a href="http://lateralaction.com/articles/productivity-ultradian-rhythms/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lateralaction.com/articles/productivity-ultradian-rhythms/</a><br><a href="http://www.ernestrossi.com/interviews/ultradia.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.ernestrossi.com/interviews/ultradia.htm</a> -- see item #4</div>
