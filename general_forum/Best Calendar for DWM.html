<div class="content">What is the BEST calendar to use for DWM implementation (that can be purchased online in the U.S.)?<br><br>I need one that has LOTS of spaces in the daily pages.</div>

<div class="content">How about this one? I saw it in Staples too - <a href="http://www.ataglance.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product3_10052_10002_144148_-1_false_10052##" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.ataglance.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product3_10052_10002_144148_-1_false_10052##</a><br><br>Or use any notebook that has the numbers of lines you need and date the pages yourself?</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Do as Lillian recommends and date the pages yourself.<br><br>It's only a hassle the first time as you can stop dating one month, or 28 days from now as I do.  First thing each day you just enter the next date, the rest of the notebook can stay blank or used fpr other purposes.<br><br>Another advantage of this is that if you miss some days due to travel, illness whatever, and don't manage to enter or process DWM for a few days, you can just start the next page by dating it one month or 28 days from your restart date..</div>

<div class="content">Since my work and home books are separate, I put Fri, Sat, and Sunday's dates on the same page in my book for the office.  It works since the Week tab will never fall on a Sat or Sun and it cuts down on the number of pages.  It also means that I am closing out one page per day, everyday, and not 3 every time a weekend comes up.<br><br>If there is a Monday holiday, I try to remember to put it on the same weekend page just to keep those days all together.  It also helps to put into perspective that there is a short week coming up.</div>

<div class="content">If you are looking for a very flexible system (although you have to write the dates on your own,  since it's a notebook, not a calendar), try the Atoma notebooks, e.g. here:<br><a href="http://www.manufactum.com/Kategorie/Suchergebnis.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.manufactum.com/Kategorie/Suchergebnis.html</a><br>I switched from Moleskine when I started with DWM and I like it.</div>
