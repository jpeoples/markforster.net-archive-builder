<div class="content">I like the classical AF1 and 4 <br><br>as I said in my last topic about the AF4R there is something very adictive in AF1 and AF4 systems. But extracting or reformulating tasks on a special sheet call unfinished or active seems to block my intuition. <br><br>So this afternoon I tried something else. <br>I simply reported all my tasks in AF1 or 4 (i dont know yet) and put a red dash in front of all my active (unfinished) tasks. Miracle ! All my intuition came back right away and reformulating increased considerably my work capacities. <br><br>I kept the recurring scheduled, someday  of my binders. <br><br>Dismissing is much better. i dove right away into action and my energy came back imediatly. <br><br>Please just dont ask me why I wont be able to explain. <br><br>As anyone tried this ? <br>As any one noticed the same experiences ?</div>

Treat it as GTD project manner. <br><br>Tasks <br>Put AF1 on a one page per day agenda a cheap travers  A5 (French) 2,50 € !<br>Divide it page in half verticaly if it helps.<br><br>- Left part put appointements and tasks (I dont have many appointments it's just a remind. <br>My appointment are on my Ical calendar synchronized with my iphone. <br>- Right part, put summerized notes about what happened or new information. <br>- In front of each task put a red dash if it is unfinished and follow.<br>- If something is due or planed at a certain date just put it on the corresponding future page. <br>- Use as a AF1 list date by date. (Mark Forster rules)<br>- If you dont have enought place for tasks goto where there is some <br><br>Well nothing to say it works.<br>Its so simple.<br>Its easy to carry anywhere<br>If an information is un usefull just cross it.</div>
