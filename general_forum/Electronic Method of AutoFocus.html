<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">It was mentioned that ideas to convert  DIT ideas to an electronic format might be helpful, and I believe I've found a usable one. As an IPhone user, I have available to me the program called Zenbe. <a href="http://www.zenbe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zenbe.com/</a>  It's extemely usable on the IPhone and could be helpful in other formats as well. It's simply a list management program, but it has two other issues that could be useful in the system. 1. It syncs with a computer model allowing updates and access from other sources, and 2. It's readable and easily updated by others you care to share it with.</div>
