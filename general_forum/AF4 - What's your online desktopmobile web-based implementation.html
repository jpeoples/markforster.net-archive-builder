<div class="content">Hi Gang,<br><br>I've been implementing AF4 since 14sep09 using Google Docs Spreadsheet from my desktop (WinXP/Firefox) and mobile (WM6.1/Iris). Works colourful and fine  on the desktop, but the Ajax is a bit slow on the mobile.<br><br>Anyone else doing the same? Tips? <br>I've earlier tried autofocus.cc but that's on AF1.<br>Any other online applications that I should be looking at?<br>While searching for "online shopping list" I did notice a number of them could easily be adapted to do AF4 ...<br><br>regards,<br>sabre23t =^.^=</div>

<div class="content">Sabre,<br><br>I've done the manual - electronic - manual circuit a couple of times.<br><br>At present I am using OneNote 2007 along the lines of Alan Baljeu, see <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/903819" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/903819</a><br><br>Although I still miss my Moelskine notebook list, highlighting, crossing out etc, I find the convenience of OneNote 2007 good and flexible.  Being able to drag task from one section to another, keeping notes and emails within the note for recurring or multi-task projects etc is nice.<br><br>I did try ListPro on my Toshiba and WM 6.1, mobile, but it reminded me too much of the "structured overhead" of GTD.<br><br>I haven't tried Mobile OneNote, may do that later after I've upgraded my HTC TouchPro 2 to WM 6.5 next week.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Roger</div>

<div class="content">I'm using Alan's implementation method in OneNote too. Done the loop myself and used MLO, but reverted to paper after finding there were considerable overheads in tweaking it to fit AF. MLO is a very nifty program, and I still use as a tickler and storing some reference material.<br><br>However, AF4 on OneNote has settled down very nicely for me. I print the Active Page on ruled paper when on the go, so I can add tasks as I go along.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the feedback RogerJ and JD. ;-)<br><br>OneNote is on the desktop, right? Mobile OneNote is on the WindowsMobile device. Wouldn't synching the OneNote desktop and the Mobile OneNote would require USB connection between the two right? Is there a way to use/synch OneNote and Mobile OneNote via the internet cloud?<br><br>The attraction of Google Docs Spreadsheet for me is the always up-to-date copy in the internet cloud that I can access/update from any web browser devices.</div>

<div class="content">I use an Excel file with several macros that I programmed, and it works really well.<br><br>I can access it from every computer I use through Dropbox. If you don't know it: It's a software that allows you to access a directory that is always synchronized through the internet.<br><br>Of course, it has to be installed, or at least carried with you in a USB stick in order to use it.<br>You can also run any program that's portable from your dropbox directory.<br><br>An all web-based solution would be preferable, I need to check Andreas' app., but for now, I've been using it for several months very efficiently.</div>

<div class="content">I use a plain old outlook task list, sorted by created date. I print it off when I'm away from the machine.</div>

<div class="content">TQ Walter and Will for the feedback. ;-)<br><br>That XLS spreadsheet synchronized on Dropbox for access anywhere is a good alternative. Since my WinMobile Excel also reads/writes XLS files, and my desktop OOo Calc also reads/writes XLS. I think I'll consider that option, if I get too tired of some of the cut&paste process I do in Google Docs to maintain my AF4 list. Just checked that rumoured Google Docs spreadsheet macros have yet to surface.<br><br>That Dropbox synch would also be good if I want to implement my AF4 list in Blade Wiki that runs on both WinMobile and WinXP. I used to do my GTD in Blade Wiki. But AF4 list is much simpler than GTD.<br><br>I just checked my WinMo 6.1 Outlook task. No "created date", but have "start date" and "due date". Could use start date for sorting. I can do cloud synch to my Lotus Notes server for the Mobile Outlook task. May be doable, but for some reason I'm not too keen on this. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I now have "Explore AF4 on OutlookTasks/NotesTodo/WebTodo" task on my AF4 Google Docs spreadsheet list. <br><br>I know using MobileOutlookTask is much easier than using Google Docs via Mobile Iris browser. But I'm not sure using LotusNotesTodo and LotusWebTodo on my desktop would be as nice as using Google Docs via Firefox.</div>

<div class="content">"Explore AF4 on OutlookTasks/NotesTodo/WebTodo" have resulted in <br>"Move tasks to Outlook Mobile Tasks / Lotus Notes ToDo" where about 75 tasks were moved.<br><br>So my current online desktop/mobile web-based AF4 implementation is ...<br>(1) Outlook Tasks on my Treo Pro WM6.1<br>(2) Lotus Notes 7 client ToDo sorted by due date  (all tasks or incomplete views)<br>(3) Lotus Notes 7 Webmail Access ToDo sorted by due date  (all tasks view only )<br>(4) All three synchronized over the air via Nokia Intellisync.<br><br>Only prob so far, is I find myself losing track of position in the list; after executing, going away, and coming back to AF4 list later ...</div>

<div class="content">I was interested by Walter's post...I'd be interested to know more about his macro's and excel approach...I'm using a very simple excel approach at the moment and keeping it simple feels good.<br><br>Just regarding his comment re: having to install or take dropbox with you...in fact you can access your dropbox account via the web...so as long as you have internet access you can sign in from any computer and download your file to work on.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Bernie,<br>I did try dropbox, installed its apps, and have a "My Dropbox" folder on my PC that is always synchronized with the one on Dropbox website. The synchronization is as simple as advertised. ;-)<br>Based on my experience with Google Docs, I'd guess Walter have programmed some macros to at least cross-out a task, add new task and cross/readd task. Ain't that difficult to record a macros while doing such spreadsheet command in Excel.<br>regards,<br>sabre23t =^.^=</div>

<div class="content">>> When I lose my place I start at the top. I fond it does no harm. <<<br>So far I haven't done that yet. Instead, I go back a few places to where I'm sure I've been before in the last cycle.<br>When I was using Google Docs Spreadsheet for AF4, I occasionally take note of my current location in the list by item number. So I go back to that item, when I lose my place.<br>Now using OutlookTask/LotusNotesTodo I no longer have item numbers, only "due date". I guess I'll occasionally now take note of current "due date" of tasks being processed, so if I lose my exact place I'll go to that due date.</div>

<div class="content">I use MyLifeOrganized, currently structured around @AutofocusHome and @AutofocusWork. Works very well, is highly flexible (so you can structure it any way you want).It's light, there's a version both for PC and Windows mobile, and you can run it off a stick as well.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Bernie<br><br>I uploaded the excel file. You can get it from this address:<br><br><a href="http://www.4shared.com/file/145362302/5a7905fe/AF_online.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.4shared.com/file/145362302/5a7905fe/AF_online.html</a><br><br>After opening, you can press CTRL-Shift-H to get help on the shortcuts.<br><br>Consider each column as a page on your "notebook", and you can keep more than one notebook in a single file (let me know if you need help with this).<br><br>Regards,<br>Walter</div>

<div class="content">Hi Walter<br><br>Thank you so much for posting your workbook...that is really cool and the hotkey are easy enogh to remember - this works a real treat and is much more attractive (and user friendly) than my smple sheet.<br><br>Thanks again! ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Walter...is there a way in which the cells in each of the main columns could be split into two...I'd qute like to be able to add a date or context (or other comment/note/tag) to items in my list so if necessary I can sort and filter.  Is this possible while still maintaining the functionality of the macro's etc you've created?<br><br>Just an idea<br><br>Thanks<br>bernie</div>

<div class="content">Hi Bernie,<br><br>Sorry that it took me some time to answer.<br><br>A few people asked for similar features before.<br>I believe that would go beyond the scope of Excel, and would turn to be more complex and prone to errors. (It's kind of difficult to validate things, for example).<br><br>I'd like to develop a small portable app, but the problem is that I'm mostly a .net programmer, and that'd demand from the users to install the .net framework.<br><br>I've been checking some other (simple and free) programming languages, but haven't made my mind. If somebody has a suggestion I'd like to hear it.<br><br>I could develop a web implementation, but Andreas is already doing that. I didn't check if it already supports AF4, though (for some reason I can't login).</div>

<div class="content">I find Google Tasks is fine - I have one list for my Active List and one for my Backlog.<br><br>The advantage of this is that I can access it from my mobile wherever I am, as well as from my computers at work and at home.</div>

<div class="content">Anton,<br><br>How do you highlight tasks for dismissal?</div>
<h2>Reply by antonvaltaz</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-11-16 18:48</div>
<div class="content">When I get to the point where I need to dismiss the last few items of the Backlog, I delete all the completed tasks off the list leaving just those few for dismissal. Then I rename the Backlog list to 'Dismissed', rename my 'Active' to 'Backlog' and create a new 'Active' list, and away I go!</div>

<div class="content">Walter:<br><br>If you contact me at andreas@autofocus.cc, I can look into what's the problem with your account. Autofocus.cc still only supports AF1, though. <br><br>I also wrote a small portable application, AutofocusAHK. Its last stable release supports AF3, if you download the source from Github and compile it yourself you can choose between AF1, AF2 and AF3. I'm currently adding AF4 and will release a new binary once it's ready. <br><br>Together with csvAF4, there are currently two portable AF apps written in Autohotkey. Perhaps you can take a look at it and see if you can do what you want with it. Or collaborate with AutofocusAHK. Another interesting language might be Python. You can create portable executables of python programs using py2exe, and python can also run on Linux and Mac Os, which is not the case for Autohotkey.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas,<br><br>I managed to login from my job's computer, since the browser stored the password. I see that it changed quite a bit! Are you planning to update it to support the later AF versions?<br><br>I've been checking the languages that you mention, AutoHotKey, AutoIt (nicer syntax?), and finally Python, which seems like a really nice language.<br><br>The problem with it is that, in order to build client applications, you have to choose between dozens of UI frameworks!<br>None of them seems to be the "standard", and knowing myself, I would spend weeks until settling with something (only to regret it one month later). It's a pity, since I'd really like to learn Python.<br><br>I would go for C++, but that would demand a lot of time and I don't really have it.<br>Then there's FreeBASIC, that also supports Linux, but I'm unconvinced.<br><br>Should I try AutoHotKey or AutoIt?</div>

<div class="content">Walter:<br><br>AutoHotKey vs AutoIt is a topic I won't touch. I know that both communities hate each other with a passion, find their respective language far superior and that there were some ugly disputes in the past concerning licenses. I just happened to get started with AutoHotKey and stuck with it. If you like the AutoIt syntax better, then go for it. All technical and ideological differences aside, I think they are very similar in what you can do with them. And they both share the same weakness of being Windows only.<br><br>Concerning GUI frameworks, I would probably make a decision between QT and GTK. Both are supported by many languages and operating systems, so learning them will benefit you even if you don't stick with python.</div>
