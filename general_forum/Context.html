<div class="content">I've run into a snag...I'm at on break at school.  <br><br>I'm looking at my AF list.  On the active page, I have "Call IRS for tax form", "take car to shop" niether of those can be done right now, because I'm at school and only have ten minutes.  <br><br>On the next page, I have "fill out financial aid form."  this could be done right now.  It doesn't make sens to me to dismiss the items I just listed because I can do them later today.  <br>It seems like this is the advantage of David Allen's context based lists (I'm another GD refugee!)  What's the procedure here in AF? <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Zack<br><br>Just move on to the next page - you only dismiss items items if nothing stands out on the first pass through a page.  Given that it will normally take many passes through a page before you reach that point, you would normally have been in the correct location to do those tasks at some point when actioning the page.  If they have not stood out by that time then they should be dismissed. Provided you have already actioned at least one item on the page then just move on.</div>

<div class="content">This is good advice, but this is a strength of GTD contexts in terms of tools needed and location.  Why even look at tasks that cannot be done in a particular location.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>AF also handles the GTD contexts in that you can have separate lists for work and home for example but AF is extremely simple and can work very well with just one list - if additional @context lists are essential I find that they tend to work themselves out as and when needed.  Can give additional info on that if required but don't want to overcomplicate my reply.</div>

<div class="content">You have rule:  "DO use a separate notebook and list for each location, e.g. Home, Workplace." in original  instructions so it is not always like this that you have to look at the task that can't be done in particular location.<br><br>There are some exceptions of course and sometimes you find a task which can't be done in current moment (sometimes even if location is good but you don't have phone right now or something)... but main advantage of this system is it's SIMPLICITY and adding contexts would ruin it :)<br></div>

<div class="content">Zack, <br><br>that's a good question, and IMHO it's really a bit of a problem with this system. <br><br>Yes, technically (true to the instructions), you should use a separate list for every location, so you should have a dedicated "school" list. If you visit school full-time (or work as a teacher) you might indeed keep a seperate list like many people do for work items (so I'll refer to a 'work' list from here on). <br><br>But it's my impression that splitting the system in too many lists isn't always helpful. It's a bit like micro-managing GTD 'contexts'. You'll run into tasks you could do at either place (like some phone calls), or that you have to do today at work because you didn't manage to do yesterday from home (like some errands at lunch time) etc. For these instances, you could add it to the other list ad hoc. However, you might have to wade through the whole 'home' list just to find that one item you want to transfer to the 'work' list. Another solution would be to take your 'home' list to work and have a peek every once in a while what you could do from that list even though you're at work. But in my mind, this won't adhere to the 'spirit' of AF.<br><br>Another restriction you mentioned is time, which poses another problem. Myself, I experienced another example a few times now: I often stay late at the office, or I might even go to the office on Saturdays or Sundays, to have some time without random interruptions. Unfortunately, I can't do all the "Call X" tasks on the list then, because nobody will take the call at the other end of the line. Or I need a colleague for a task who's not there.<br><br>Any way you put it, you *will* run into task that you're not resisting, but that you cannot do right now. And that you most certainly don't want to dismiss.<br><br>If I'm not mistaken, this has been discussed here before (although I can't find it right now). <br><br>The first solution - which, IIRC was favored in that other thread - is to say to yourself, "Well, at least I thought about it and that's *something*", cross it off and re-add it to the end of your list. This will keep the list in motion. However, it might feel a bit like 'cheating' or even a little ridiculous.<br><br>Another possible solution would be to just ignore the instructions in this point, and move to the next page nonetheless. It's like saying to yourself, "Well, it's not my fault, so I'll just move on." However, that way you might block the page from being closed by dismissing the other items. If it takes a long time to do the item that's blocking the page, those semi-rotten pages could pile up.<br><br>Personally, I would opt for the first solution, but not whole-heartedly. <br><br>-- <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I think it would make a fascinating study to look at the ways in which our approach to things impacts on the ways in which we use systems (of any kind) and in particular our approaches to system structure.  I love creating systems and creating structure but in my field of consultancy would approach things from an overview - identifying the bigger picture and then working to systemise it appropriately.  Starting outside the box as it were and defining or creating the boxes needed.   I would imagine that in your line of work it would require a very different approach - almost the opposite in fact - in that you would literally be looking at "the smaller picture" and the impact that has on the bigger picture. <br><br>I have not used GTD so am not qualified to comment from a position of experience but the detail of the system both appeals to me and repels me at the same time.  The appeal is in the structure and systemisation - I can see how I could lovingly spend hours creating my perfect lists of contexts, categorising my tasks and planning my reviews.  However it is that same level of detail that repels me - but from a position of self-preservation.  I know that it is the type of system where I could end up with making the system an end in itself, rather than actually getting things done.  I have often said that I love creating systems but hate following them and I think that is why I have taken to AF so well.  Part of me would love complexity but it is the self preservation side that wins hands down for me with AF! <br><br>There is clearly a deep seated need in many of us to have structure and systems, otherwise there would be little or no discussion on type of notebook, digital solutions, highlighters, tags etc.  But wouldn't this forum be very bland if we all looked at things in exactly the same way!  Now I'm off to work out how to "add something" to my system - perhaps create a turquoise notebok, and use a purple fountain pen ....... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Zack<br><br>The beauty of AF is it's simplicity but that is very much simplicity of use - not of effect.  Because the system is so simple it really does work best by sticking to the instructions and not trying to tweak it to fit particular scenarios.  Yes there are occasions when the rules need to be broken or bent a little, but even those are allowed for in the common sense rule, i.e. if something needs to be done now, do it now and the permission to have more than one list (ie by location) if necessary.  What I would not want to do is to influence you to try anything other than sticking to the basic system, as written, as I believe that is the only way to get AF working effectively.<br><br>Where AF gets complicated as it were, is in the way in which it gets to the heart of the reasons for our procrastination and our resistance to items.  There comes a point at which we are forced to decide - we either do the item or we dismiss it.  However, before we reach that point we will invariably have discovered that the reasons for our procrastination may be something totally unrelated to the item itself.  We can choose to ignore those factors and "just" use AF to get things done, or we can make changes based on what we learn about ourselves in the process.  For example someone identified fairly early on that the reason for their resistance to a number of items was down to the fact that they were in the wrong job.  Once a realisation like that is made, a decision needs to be made - stick with it and work through the resistance or change job!  <br><br>With reference to the issue of contexts, which was the subject of your post above, the instructions say to use a different list for different locations.  However Mark has stated that he uses one notebook for all - in that he is home based - and others, myself included have found that to be an ideal way of dealing with AF.  One list captures everything, and if I am not in the right place (context) then the common sense rule will always apply.  What I have found however, is that other lists naturally develop out of the usage of AF.  This is particularly true in the context (no pun intended!) of projects, and I have just done a fairly detailed post on this at<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/669745" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/669745</a> <br><br>describing how project lists can be incorporated within AF even though they are actually part of a project management system which would be kept outside of AF.  It must be kept in mind that AF is for use with discretionery time and works alongside a calendar/diary system and project management system, rather than replacing everything.  There will be times when a separate list is more practical - for example if you are working at a location where your list is viewable by colleagues, you may not want to have "sort sock draw" next to "prepare agenda for Board Meeting", even though those items can sit next to eachother quite happily for the purposes of AF.  I have just one notebook, but do have a system for identifying "like items" if I need to, the equivalent of contexts as it were.<br> <br>Mark has pointed out in another post the fact that AF is not GTD and it can cause some confusion in trying to marry up some of the concepts as they work on very different lines.  I would again recommend that you try as far as possible to action the system without the preconceptions of use of context etc and I think you will find that all of those things will just fall into place quite naturally.  Hope I haven't overcomplicated too much :-)</div>

<div class="content">There are lots of ways to handle this.  No reason to think AF is broken.  :-)<br><br>AF is meant to help manage your discretionary time.  I wouldn't count ten minutes between classes as an ordinary block of discretionary time.  So, I wouldn't expect to follow all the normal AF rules then.  I'd just flip through my book till I happened across something I could actually move forward in those 10 minutes.  But the next time I have some "real" discretionary time, I'd work the AF book as normal.<br><br>If these little snippets of time occur frequently, you can set up a separate list in the back of your notebook, like a "shopping list", with a few items copied from your main AF list.  So, when you have those little opportunities, you can flip right there and action something.  Back in your main AF list, you can have an item "Review snippets list" or something.   <br><br>But there's no pressing need to systematize this and create similar lists for absolutely every "@context".    You can try several approaches and see what works best.   It's easy to tie everything into your main AF list with single task entries.</div>

<div class="content">I find that AF lists work so much better for me than GTD context lists ever really did, based on the fact that I'm really doing or chipping away at a lot of tasks.  My problem is that when I'm at work, I will always eventually look at my AF lists, since, well, they contain my work and I'm at work.  It's not quite as easy with my home list, since I do other things at home besides stuff on my list, like relax, read, watch shows, cook---things I really don't want to include on my list, since they're just life---and I just want to "be" and not "do" all the time.  Consequently, sometimes I don't look through my home list often enough.  Maybe I need at-home "work" hours, but that's never worked out for me (for example, paperwork/desk appointments haven't ever worked for me).  So, I haven't solved this, but it's still working far far better than my context lists.  <br><br>Also, I have separate lists in my PDA for when I'm not home or at work, including shopping lists and just out-and-about to do lists.  I haven't developed a really good way to do the out-and-about lists, I just keep them on my PDA calendar, which involves copying uncompleted items forward.  <br><br>Any and all advice very welcome.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark, I have / am working on the same problem as you have described:<br><br>    "It's not quite as easy with my home list, since I do other things at home besides stuff on my list, like relax, read, watch shows, cook---things I really don't want to include on my list, since they're just life---and I just want to "be" and not "do" all the time.

I try to pick something that can be done while I'm cooking supper during that time.  I'm not strict with the page I pull the task off from, because I just want to get naturally pulled into the process.   I don't really care that selecting this way is not following the system, I'm a person, not a robot.  On weekends I follow it properly 95% of the time.<br><br>Well, it worked really well last night as I burnt supper again and got annoyed with my son for interrupting me while I was working on my list.  I didn't stop until close to 11 p.m. (I was up this morning at 5), and was all wound up and couldn't sleep.  An example of 'be careful what you wish for cuz you just might get it."  <br><br>Needless to say, my 10 minute task this morning (not off any list) was tickling my son awake for school and my 10 minute task tonight will be just that - 10 minutes with a timer set and everything - prior to playing the Wii / watching a movie / cracking open a book.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I think everyone has such different circumstances that it is difficult to lay down any rules about how many lists should be used. But my gut reaction to the question is: "As few as possible".<br><br>The question about whether one should dismiss items when you can't physically do them at that particular moment of time keeps coming up, and my answer has always been "Yes, you should". My reason is that you will already have had numerous opportunities to do the item, so there's no reason to think that you would do it even if you were able to.<br><br>Also bear in mind that if you have a policy (as I have) to dismiss items even if you can't do them, then that policy is going to be part of your subconscious thinking when visiting a page. For instance you might come to an item which you can do, but is one of the few remaining items on the page. If you know that you might not be able to do it next time you visit the page, then that will encourage you to do it while you can. Note that for this to work properly, you need consistent use of the policy.</div>
