<div class="content">Hi, David<br><br>I've been out most of the morning so haven't had much chance to work the list today. This is a good thing as it will enable me to test out what happens when I can't get everything done that I'm supposed to - that is a very important part of the new system.</div>

<div class="content">Perfect!  This indeed was exactly what you were looking for.  Maybe have some more distractions....go for a walk, have some tea, read a magazine....put yourself way behind....smiles.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Oh heck... If you told us about your new system before actually launching it in order to raise your book sales before possibly disappointing us with the actual system... It worked. I just ordered DIT from Amazon ;). Still have to finish reading GED though...<br>I'm curious about the new system! Now I have my iPhone and running FocusPad by Tony, I'm finally getting consistent with AF4 :).<br>Regards,<br>Tijl</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br><< Are you close enough to provide a rough estimate of a release date >><br><br>Not really. I can't assume that the testing will be ok. If there is a need to make further adjustments, then those are going to have to be tested too.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Okay -- of course....was just wondering.  Like so many others, am anxiously waiting to see this new version.  But take your time!  Like I need to tell you that....smiles....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I just wondered if you had any update on DIT2 - the original DIT is an excellent system so I am really looking forward to V2!<br><br>Jason</div>

<div class="content">If we look back at the history of Autofocus v1, Mark originally announced his intentions on Dec 18, 2008, and the beta instructions were released Jan 5, 2009 (18 days later).  See <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/category/autofocus?currentPage=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/category/autofocus?currentPage=2</a> for the chronology.  It seems the seeds for AF were planted with this article: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/11/17/the-simplest-time-management-method.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/11/17/the-simplest-time-management-method.html.</a><br><br>If we apply the same timeline to DIT2, Mark pre-announced it on Jan 26, 2010, so maybe we'll see it 18 days later, around Feb 13, 2010 (the perfect Valentine's gift for your loved ones?).  :-)<br><br>Still re-reading DIT to refresh my memory in the interim.</div>

<div class="content">Hi MartyH<br>I regard DIT as a reference book now.  Every time I go back to it, I seem to either learn something I forgot (memory issues) or it stirs me to more carefully consider aspects concerning how I govern myself.  I've referred to it quite often and will probably do so again.  It's a great source of re-aligning my thinking when I get lazy or overwhelmed!  *blush*  It re-affirms that it's always doable if I approach it correctly.  <br>learning as I go.</div>

<div class="content">How about lazy and overwhelmed!  Some days are like that.  But it usually is overwhelmed at work and lazy at home.</div>

<div class="content">I totally empathize with your feeling Marty.  The feeling is going away though as I follow the system: write everything down where it won't be lost (the List) and go through the list in regular fashion.  I'm becoming aware of the things that need doing and that helps me choose which things to do and which to put off.  That makes me less overwhelmed, and also less tired when I get home.</div>
