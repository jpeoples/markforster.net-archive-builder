<div class="content">In the book "Making It All Work" by David Allen, on page 297-298, there are six horizons of focus. <br>This is covered in detail from pages 200-265. <br>From highest altitude to lowest altitude: <br><br>1. Purpose and principles <br>2. Vision<br>3. Goals<br>4. Areas of Responsibility<br>5. Projects <br>6. Actions <br><br>Is there anything equivalent or comparable in any of Mark Forster's blog or books? <br>I have not read all of Mark Forster's books, and it is likely that he has dealt with this.</div>

<div class="content">Mark F. has always had a more fluid approach to integrating what GTD would call the various horizons. Long list methods are intended to have both "Ground Level" and "50,000 Feet" stuff and everything in between put on the list, both in the form of questions and in the form of statements, goals, outcomes, etc. The intent is that you "action these" by, at the very least, reviewing them often as a matter of working your system. <br><br>However, that's not the only approach that Mark has given. The SoPP book goes into some good detail about the use of questioning as a means of exploring these ideas. Even further, Mark's Dreams book covers an entire time management approach driven entirely by a vision/goal statement that pulls you towards it, coupled with a system of daily accounting and monitoring and a method of questioning to diagnose systems level issues. Because this book is so different than the others, it's worth reading simply for that alone.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, <br><br>I did read the posts.  Thanks.  <br>However, these two seem to contradict each other.  The top 10 post recommends major goals, but the goalless post does not recommend goals.</div>

<div class="content">Aaron, <br><br>Thanks for answering this.  I have brought this up before in previous posts, and have wondered about it. <br>Yes, I am aware that Mark Forster has the 50,000 feet stuff and lower altitudes in the long list.  However, those items are the ones that tend to remain on my long list.  I think it is because they require a different thinking mode than tasks/next actions, and cannot be handled as rapidly as those. <br>I haven't read the Secrets book, but there is a blog post on Questioning.  I'll have to get that book. <br>I started to read the Dreams book years ago, but I had trouble understanding it.  It was in a PDF file, I think.  (Is that still available for download?)  It seemed quite different from the other books, and I didn't know how to integrate it with those. But the title "Dreams" would imply that this is higher level.</div>
