<div class="content">I just finished reading DIT. Thanks Mark for this great book with indeed some interesting ideas. I was happpy to see that i already applied some of advices. <br><br>I love the concept of good principle of time management, emergency, CLOSED LIST, WILL DO LIST, Manana principle, CURRENT INITIATIVE, Keys of dealing with project and the summery at the end. I liked the principle of pratical exercices witch made me understand where some of the difficulties i still already have and how to cure them ASAP. <br><br>Mark, Sorry about this question, but there is something wich is not clear at all for me and i want to understand it now before filling the beautifull new diary A4 day by day i bought yesterday for nothing but DIT. <br><br>- How AF comes into the DIT system ? Is there any link with closed list with the two methods or are the fully and totally separated  ? <br><br>I may be wrong but i perceive AF4 like a general list mixt of list of current initiative, close list, will do list. <br><br>1. In other way I wonder if i have to choose a method of doing things ie it would make me choose between  AF4 or DIT... ?<br><br>2. I thought there would be another solution. There is a Link beetwin the 2 methods. The link is the close list. Then, it means that i use AF4 like a general list during my all day. It includes a Close and an open list. The close list contains items wich are reported day by day on my day to day diary with the DIT method. If there are really urgent thing (sens of dit) then they are reported under the line on my todat page of my day to day diary. I could pick too things little by little on my AF4 open list and complete my DIT diary. When item are picked on AF4 they would be definitivly crossed. <br><br>Then during the day i will work on my diary with the DIT method + AF4 used as a report and checking tool for my current initiative (projects with don(t have anay dead line). <br><br>- Please MARK could you precise your point of view ? What is the solution ? Do I have to choose or can i use both ? How did you think the system ? <br><br>Many thanks indeed for the answer.</div>

<div class="content">AF (any edition) is not intended to be related to DIT. They are two quite distinct systems. They do obviously overlap in some respects, and if you find a way of combining the two that works for you then I'm certainly not going to complain!</div>

<div class="content">Mark Thanks for the answer. There are some very intresting ideas with DIT. I found some too with GTD and zen GTD. At last I like using AF4 because it's indeed perfect for following actionable tasks and following almost all of my activities. I have summerized all these methods. I gona work on my own trying to apply the best of them.  I am sure it is possible and easy. There is a real power with AF4. I noticed than even on the rush and whatever happened in my life AF4 was still working perfectly and operational. May be the idea could be ti separate actionbable items than non actionable items. May be the idea would be to work on 3 ways the first one the PROJECT, the secont the ACTION, the third the TIMING to do it. I am indeed sure tht AF4 must be reserved for acting. I gonna report my ideas either on this forum and on my blog when the system will be tested and fully operationnal. Thanks for all.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark T.<br><br>I think what Jupiter is referring to is ZTD (Zen to Done) by Leo Babatua.  Here's a link that  explains it:<br><br><a href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/04/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/2007/04/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/</a></div>

<div class="content">Thanks jacqueline. Exactly I bought the  ebook and found it very interesting. I think Leon Barbotta in indeed right about the way he understood GTD. AS you know i have been working since 3 years with GTD and there is alway some very big problems about doint in my activities. <br>So try to keep the best of it and do my ow method wich gona be a mixt of all. Anyway leo's ebook is really interesting have a look on it. DIT too and for me AF4 is the best system i ever found for acting and following stuff. Nothing is better than it it still resist since i worked on AF1 (over 6 mons) and for me it is prodigious ;)) :)) Best to all.</div>

<div class="content">The key principle from DIT, which I use all the time with AF, is Little and Often.<br><br>This is what makes the Mark Forster systems superior to GTD, from my perspective.<br><br>The key concept for GTD is the Next Action. Before I stop working on something, in GTD, I need to figure out what the next physical action will be. I always had trouble with this back in the day when I was a GTDer, before I ever heard of Mark Forster. The concept of "next physical action" cannot be uniquely defined. "Murder boss?" "Shoot gun?" "Pull trigger?" "Flex right index finger?" There are so many ways to describe an action. <br><br>The great thing about Little and Often, is that I don't have to worry about defining the next action because I know that when it comes time for me to start working on that item, I will redefine the action at the time I begin working on it. I can write anything I want in my list. Let's say I write "Murder boss." From reading the DIT book, I know that I don't actually have to murder him right now, in order to mark the item off, and then re-enter it at the bottom of the list. I merely have to take any action related to the project. I might pull the Murder Boss folder out of my file cabinet and review my notes. I might look in the safe to make sure my revolver is in good working order. <br><br>If I didn't have Little and Often, I don't know if I could get AF to work for me at all. Little and Often is what allows me to make some progress on the kinds of things that, with GTD, I would put off for months, or even years.</div>

<div class="content">AF4 vs DIT is an interesting question.  Viewing it from my limited knowledge, I see similarities between AF4 and DIT.  Both system use a closed and an open list, where the closed list gets most of the focus. In both systems there is a possibility to work on items on the open list.  DIT is strongly time bound, as closed lists only exist for a day. Imposing to AF4 the same time constraint(clock) could make the two methods look very similar.  <br>But that's maybe only for me, as (over)focusing on similarities is often my way of working.<br><br>Damien</div>

<div class="content">Moises thanks for your 'murder boss' analogy - LOL what a great way of describing the little and often approach!<br><br>Another principle I have found useful in DIT is the LIFO principle (I know Mark doesn't call it that in the book) so that if you do things as they come up instead of leaving them until the deadline and panicking, you can keep on top of things.</div>

<div class="content">@moises:<br><<The great thing about Little and Often, is that I don't have to worry about defining the next action because I know that when it comes time for me to start working on that item, I will redefine the action at the time I begin working on it.>><br><br>I think, one of the differences between GTD and AF is the time when you think about the next action. In GTD you do some kind of pre-planing in AF the thinking starts when the AF-instructions show you the next task/project. I'm not really sure if the pre-planing method isn't more successful for the "murder boss"-project ;-)<br><br>- Jens</div>

<div class="content">The AF-DIT methods also involve preplanning. The difference is that I can tell myself that if I get a paper-clip out of my drawer I have advanced my plan, and, if I wish, I can get the thrill of "completing" an item. Of course, I will re-add the item, but  at least I know that I have advanced towards the goal and I don't beat myself up as badly for having avoided the item or procrastinated.</div>
