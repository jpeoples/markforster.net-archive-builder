<div class="content">Paper or digital ?<br><br>I've wandered back and forth the first weeks? But now I have settled on on an "intelligent" notebook, always at hand : <br>* it unifies calendar and AF list<br>* it "swallows" new items I may have created elsewhere<br>* it records behind the scenes creation date (when I enter an item), finish date (when I tick it done)<br>* it opens where I left, hilites where on the page I was, crosses out done items, and archive dismissed when there are.<br>* it let me enter a due date if I need, and reminds me items that have now become urgent.<br>* urgent items are displayed (and can be managed) from calendar.<br>* easy export in worksheets<br>* light, tiny, against my heart (my shirt front left pocket), I can use it even in the dark !<br><br><br>My « notebook » has three lines when I first open it in the day: NOW - THEN - LAST.<br>I wrote « Notebook », because — you guessed it — the notebook I use for this is in fact a handheld, with an outliner.<br><br>Lines can be expanded like this :<br><br>->NOW<br> ->->Hot items (close to deadline)<br><br>->THEN<br>->->AF pages filled with items (AF rules compliance !)<br>->->-> items (outstanding, done or dismissed)<br><br>->LAST<br>->->Last AF page being filled with new items<br><br><br>I stated  "intelligent" because it brings me many benefits :<br><br>* Calendar and AF list are always together in my pocket and I can enter anything at any time (aven in the dark !)<br>My above Now-Then-Last is an outliner file :<br>* it lets me jump to bottom for a new item, and then jump back to the page I came from<br>* I can zoom on the page I'am working to avoid distraction ...<br>* when I create an item, the creation date is silently recorded<br>* when I tick an item as done, it is crossed out and the finish date is silently recorded<br>* it can filter with a tap all items (if any) for which I entered a deadline that is Today items, tomorrow,.. this week items.<br>* it allows to drag in "NOW" from a page an item that is now urgent.<br>* if I tick a second box (end of line), the item is copied in the Todo database (and remain synchronized), and appears in Calendar view today if undated, or at the target day if I entered one.<br>* if I mark that item done either in calendar or in "Notebook", it is marked done in the other too.<br>* same if I delete.<br>* any list of new todos produced while using another tool (for me mainly A&B and Personal Brain) can be appended to ->LAST (via an imported memo)<br>* I may tag items I'd want to easily filter out ( "DISMISS"... I finally never used other tags since I play AF : cycling again and again has engraved in my mind my current items !)<br>* Dissmissed items can be filtered out and archived in another file.<br>* I may export to Excel for history, reviews or updating other tools.<br><br>(Those who still have, or have had a Palm may have guessed the outliner I use for that is ShadowPlan from Jeff Mitchell. You can probably do more or less alike with other lists managers, and on other PDAS or smartphones).</div>

<div class="content">Jacques, <br><br>thanks for your description. <br><br>While I'm not so sure that your implemetation is true to the spirit of AF (I guess Mark would regard it as overly complicated), it's quite intriguing. I happen to be a registered user of ShadowPlan. <br><br>I don't think this solution could be replicated easily with other outliners or on other mobile platforms, since ShadowPlan's capabilities are really outstanding. So is the program's complexity, unfortunately, and I have to admit that I've given up on it quickly when I tried to learn it way back then (another reason for that were some issues with the Mac desktop, as I'll elaborate below). <br><br>However, there is an important distinction between 'ease of use' and 'easy to learn', which many people confuse. Often, the investment in learning pays out, and once you 'got' it, it's not *that* hard anymore. Sometimes it's exactly the 'easy to learn' programs that are most cumbersome to use (e.g. by making you mouse, click and type through several form fields where setting up two or three templates or using a command line with a few arguments would speed things up considerably). But I digress.<br><br>I'm tempted to try your implementation. One advantage of ShadowPlan is that it also has a Mac desktop companion program (which is very rare). OTOH the desktop app is not only butt-ugly (the same goes for the Windows desktop) and not really Mac-like, but also partially disfunctional (some buttons of the interface overlie others), and the nice OmniOutliner add-on has been abandoned for years. <br><br>One final remark: As clever and tricked-out as your solution is, I'm afraid that not many readers will be able to follow your description. I know for sure that I don't fully know how to realize your concept, and I hope you don't mind if I contact you directly when the time has come for me to put it into practice. <br><br>Kind Regards, <br>Alex</div>
