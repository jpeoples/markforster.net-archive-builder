<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content"><br>I started with AF in February and it worked out remarkably well. What appealed to me was the simplicity of writing my tasks in a notebook. Nothing more.<br><br>Now, I have scanned the forum and found many people having problems with dismissing, getting through their active pages and handling urgent tasks. Interestingly, these are exactly the things I found AF handling exceptionally well. Let me explain why:<br><br>Firstly, I spend most of my time on the last page. This is the work area, this is what I am doing right now: the automatically established focus. Reentering tasks, adding follow-up and new tasks, I often stay on the last page for a whole day and more. Peace of mind is retained, because I know I have everything else noted down on earlier pages.<br><br>Every once in a while I loose steam. That is when I return to the first active page. Going through the active pages is a realively quick process. It is also more of a review than a work process. »Standing out« for me means looking for tasks that are urgent or important or somehow ›fell‹ from the last past. Then I do some work to get them going (again) and move them to the last page.<br><br>At this stage I also dismiss pages. This is very important for me. Without dismissing I feel I would procrastinate, do unimportant stuff only to ›save‹ a page. Only when I dismiss I can focus on the important things. So I dismiss everything unless (a) it is more important than what I am doing right now (i.e. is on the last page) or (b) I have promised someone to do it.<br><br>Some of these things are urgent. Fine. So I start it, it moves to the last page and this allows me to focus on it as long as necessary. Urgent stuff had alway been somewhat of a problem for me, because I would loose sight of the more important things. This is where AF helped: sure, I might loose focus on something I worked before, but I know I will pick it up again once I move though my active pages.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Olaf<br><br>Great post - really sums up well how AF moves items along.  Makes me realise though that at the beginning I had a lot of "obligation" items which were/are difficult to move along and have a high resistance factor.  AF has made me aware of the need to reexamine what I say "yes" to and to remove many of those obligations.</div>

<div class="content">This is good.  It does, once again, raise some questions in my mind.  Do you start your morning on where you left off the day before -- marked in some way -- or do you automatically start on the last page in the morning?  If I remember correctly, Mark said that one should continue where left off, but if you have been gone a bit, it is best to start on the first active page.<br><br>I can see a real benefit in making a stance to start every morning on your last page, work through that as you deem necessary, and then go back to the first active page and work forward.  Interesting....any comments from others?  Mark, what do you suggest?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content"><br>David,<br><br>usually, I start with the last page. This weekend, however, I did not use my list. So, tomorrow starting with the first page seems like the right thing to do. But most of the time I do not get stuck in the middle of my book. As I said, going through my active pages does not take very long. For me, it's a change of pace. Let's say I come upon a book I have to read. Now I don't sit down and read for two hours. (I might do that once it is on the last page.) Rather, I jot down some questions, read the table of contents, skim through the introduction, think about some more questions, etc. Then I move the task to the last page and proceed (most likely to the next page).<br><br>Christine,<br><br>at first the AF approach seemed very unstructured to me (but I confess, that also somewhat appealed to me). I think the reason AF works so well for me is that using more complicated systems, I never had the feeling of being in control, there always was another list to review or a reminder file to check.<br><br>I forgot to mention an important modification I made: I use the last (full) page and the "very last" (half-filled) page as a unit: that is my work area. Every time the very last page is filled, the focus shifts and tightens a little.<br><br>Altogether, AF allows me to be as unorganised as possible, while still providing indispensable structure:<br><br>- the ability to focus on my work as long as I want (the last page);<br>- the ability to shift focus (radically) and still return to the previous focus (it remains in the active pages): this works for urgent tasks as well as when I am bored or tired;<br>- the ability to add new tasks as they come in without the need (but the possibility) of working on them right away;<br>- the ability to retain tasks on my active pages without the need to commit to them instantly;<br>- the ability to dismiss anything I do not get around to without loosing (it remains highlighted)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Olaf<br><br>I find the feeling of control with AF really amazing - the system is so simple it feels like it shouldn't work - but does!!<br><br>Interesting what you said about your last page + modification.  I have to say I did something very similiar when clearing a backlog; because tasks were interdependent I found myself working on a batch of "last items".  That seemed to fit naturally into the AF flow - I could have done a prject time block instead but found that I wanted to have everything relevant in AF.  It worked really well on that occasion and I continued to move on from the last but one page in the normal way very naturally until the project was complete.</div>
