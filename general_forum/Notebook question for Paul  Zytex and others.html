<div class="content">Here in Ireland they are known as 'Nature Study Notebooks' and are used in schools and colleges where a combination of writing and diagrams are needed.<br><br>They can be hard to find here, but the larger stationary stores stock them from time to time - so I buy a few of them at a time. I have found only one supplier online (see URL below).<br><br><<a href="http://www.schoolbooks.ie/school-books/2456-0-Notebooks---Hardback-School-Books.php>" rel="nofollow">http://www.schoolbooks.ie/school-books/2456-0-Notebooks---Hardback-School-Books.php></a><br><br>While the notebooks have the following brand names and URL printed on them, the websites don't actually exist (weird).<br><br>Supreme Stationary 200 Page Nature Notebook www.supreme-stationery.com (does not exist!)<br>Lismore 120 Page Nature Notebook www.kempis.com (empty website!)<br><br>The notebooks have a sewn-in ribbon book-mark which I use to mark my place among the active pages. I staple two wide elasticised markers on the front and back covers. The front one marks the oldest active page and the back one marks the newest page. That way I can flip open the book exactly at the page I need.<br><br>By using un-ruled pages for note-taking I am encouraged to be artistic and graphic and creative. I find this stimulates the right hemisphere and promotes better integration between left- and right- brain thinking.<br><br>Oh, by the way, I have settled on using a propelling pencil for these books. Fountain pens are great - but often dry-up or become patchy at unpredictable moments. Ball-point pens get blotchy when you use them to draw lines (crossing-out entries and drawing mind maps) - I got blobs of ink on the pages, my fingers and clothes. The pencil (I use B or 2B graphite) slows my writing down enough to keep it legible - and has a lovely tactile feel. It also encourages me to shade things and doodle in 3D on the blank pages.<br><br>I have, in the past, used a hardback A4 Sketchbook - with blank pages only. This allowed my right-brain stuff to flourish, but its difficult to keep the lists neat and tidy without the ruled lines.<br><br>I hope this helps.<br>Respect</div>

<div class="content">I'm surprised Moleskine hasn't produced this format, I would use it for non-DWM stuff, and for DWM if I went back to paper 100%.</div>

<div class="content">Hi -- longtime lurker here chiming in for this thread.  I just saw a notebook like this in the Levenger catalog.  Here's a link to the info online:<br><br><a href="http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=Category=322-325|Level=2-3|pageid=7194" rel="nofollow">http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=Category=322-325|Level=2-3|pageid=7194</a><br><br>Levenger's gear is usually expensive but good quality.</div>
