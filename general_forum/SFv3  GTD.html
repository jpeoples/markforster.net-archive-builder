<div class="content">Bob >>> That said I don't think you need GTD to do SFv3; but GTD has needed SFv3 for a long time....>>>><br><br>Alan >>>Would SF people be more successful if they processed things through GTD and used SF for Doing? I doubt it. >>>><br><br>I agree, but I think some of the teaching of GTD could help make SFv3 more fluid. I think that some GTD vertrans will be successful sooner in SFv3 is they have internalized some parts of GTD.<br><br>Amongst those would be:<br><br>1) Recognizing multiple step project in the GTD flavor. So that you can put the project on the list; start a phase of it; check it off; move it to column 2 as unfinished; finish that phase of the project check it off in column two and then give yourself permission to put it back in column 1 because the next discrete step is a different action of a larger project that might take weeks. That approach saves you having to remember to put each discrete system into the system. <br><br>2) Learning to write tasks in an clean actionable manner that make them more appealing to do.<br><br>3) Keeping everything in your trusted system when possible; don't demand it; but strive for it when it fits the moment.<br><br>4) Reviewing the entire system as often as necessary. And reviewing trigger lists when you have that nagging feeling that you forgetting something.<br><br>5) Learning to get back on the wagon really fast when you fall off. seems a common gtd problem<br><br>6) Recognizing when a days "context" has nothing to do with anything else on your list; putting the list away and getting through the day without guilt knowing that tomorrow you can get back on list and start cleaning up the mess...<br><br>7) Having checklists for recurrent procedures and just putting "do checklist XXX" into the system and not trying to manage the details.<br><br><br><br>There are others; and I don't claim they are unique to GTD; but learning GTD teaches them and they make you more efficient in any system if you can taylor them to your unique reality; which is key. <br><br>Perspective is king: In my world I can't make the "timed" start on the coffee pot save enough effort to justify using it; and yet the delayed start on the oven; I use that all the time to ensure dinner is started on time.</div>

<div class="content">Hm, I don't consider myself to be following GTD. Yet I do all the above except 4 and 5.  Well I do occasionally read through everything which Mark also advises (4).<br><br>(5) there really isn't much falling off. If I put the list away for a week, I just pick it up again, no big deal. GTD was harder so it was easier for one week to become one month, but it just doesn't happen for me in Autofocus.</div>

<div class="content">GTD is made to be efficient with the work at hand.<br>Problem is, it has a hefty overhead so over all, it's not efficient.<br><br>AF is made to be effective.<br>And I find that it is.</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><<it has a hefty overhead so over all, it's not efficient.>><br>yes, the weekly review with some much people struggle. But the review leads to well thought out tasks (next actions) which should be considered as a kick-start to move forward. What makes GTD more complex for many people is the misunderstanding, that projects have to be scrambled many many little doable task - this isn't the case.<br><br>I liked GTD very much and it worked quite well. But I use AF1 since Marc released it and an small hack which combines DiT with AF1 in a simple way. Now I use SFv3 and it works pretty well - by now ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>Funny: I just read a GTD fan saying the exact same thing the other way around: he felt that GTD is a complete productivity system while DIT/AF/SF just help you manage tasks efficiently.</div>

<div class="content">Will - <br><br>The problems arise when GTD users rely exclusively on GTD's guidance for managing tasks (there really isn't much there, in any of the GTD books at least that I can see).<br><br>And they arise when DIT/AF/SF users expect DIT/AF/SF to replace their calendar, filing system, tickler system, and project management systems.<br><br>If we understand what the tools are designed for, and what their strengths and weaknesses are, we can be a lot more effective overall.   And then Erik and the GTD fan you mention can all live together in harmony.  :-)</div>
