<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2013-07-29 14:56</div>
<div class="content">I wanted to make a separate thread for this, but I already posted this idea here:<br><br>     <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1908142?currentPage=2#post2167090" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1908142?currentPage=2#post2167090</a><br><br>My idea was to take any Autofocus-style system and split it into two lists, a Focus list and a Whenever list.  All urgent tasks and tasks with hard deadlines belong in the Focus list, everything else belongs in the Whenever list -- no matter how important.  (e.g. if you can answer "yes" to "Can this slide if necessary?")<br><br>However, to provide some focus on task completion, my idea was also to allow a very few (~3 or fewer) other tasks to be in the Focus list.  (This could be a "current initiative" task, or a "Top 3" selection of tasks, for example.)  Having too many of these would defeat the purpose of the Focus list.<br><br>To process the two lists, you alternate between them (starting each day on the Whenever list), following the rules of the underlying Autofocus-style system on each list independently.  After each task actioned on the Whenever list, switch to the Focus list, where you stay until nothing "stands out", then switch back to the Whenever list again.  However, each time you switch lists, you have to action at least one task before switching back.  If nothing "stands out" on the first pass, then search for the task with the most resistance and work on that before switching back.<br><br>Thoughts?  Good approach or not?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Devon<br>This sounds fairly close to assigning MITs. If an MIT has a lot of resistance, I'll choose "relief" tasks until I'm shored up enough to go back to the highly resistance task. If there is more than one MIT that creates high resistance, I'll simply focus on finishing one using relief tasks or chipping away at the other resistance laden MITs but my focus is to finish one at a time. This gives me enough leeway so that I don't get too frustrated or bound by rules. Sometimes when I have completed my one focus MIT, I'll discover that I've also chipped away at other MITs as relief. I keep doing that until my MITs are done. After that I can choose other work or not. Once the MITs are done, it's my choice whether to continue working or not.<br><br>Maybe it's me, but I like flexibility and also focus. Once I've chosen my MITs for the day, I find that I'm more successful if I'm not constrained by rules of what to do in what order.<br><br>Also I don't like the rule of "Must be done today" or a hard deadline to allow it into the focus list. RARELY do I have work I MUST do today. I feel more calm when I can stay ahead or at least current. I don't trust myself to wait until the due date to do my work. I prefer the flexibility of using my time to prevent having to do it today.  If it gets put on me then I have no choice. If I do have a choice, I'd prefer to do it leisurely ahead of time.<br><br>Also some of the most important work does not have a true deadline. I flexibly make them up as in a timeline.  I also do this with recurring work.  I don't have to have inbox zero, all mail processed everyday. I just review it to make sure no bombs are going to detonate if left neglected.  I'll add it to my MIT list when it's timely to do so in relation to it's relative importance.  Rules just seem to get in the way.  It's far easier to decide what's important and do it.  Add to it if somebody puts something on you or adjust it as you do your work.  Some projects need to be put aside while my mind catches up to it's progress to continue the plan or adjust itor figuring out the reason for it's failure.  <br><br>I like your ideas. Unfortunately my mind needs more flexibility to decide how to approach my important work.  Rigid, stagnant rules just bungle up it up for me.  Only I know how to approach my high resistance work and keep at it. Only I know when I need to switch gears for awhile.  For me, if I put too much on myself or not enough, it'll cause me to scrap the plan.  Sometimes I need to adjust the plan midstream if my brain or body fights against me. Sometimes my poor attitude needs a different workaround.  I envy you guys who can easily work a plan within rules.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Sounds promising. It feels like a more formal version of Learning's MIT / Relief Task method, without the "MIT's all done, day's work is done" feature. Maybe it's a matter of timing, but this feels better than Mark's variations on the same theme. Maybe it's because there's more flexibility while in the Focus list.<br><br>I predict a temptation to give important things dates just so they can go on the Focus list, rather than admit they're Whenevers. Probable Result: Bloated Focus list and mix of hard and soft deadlines. Confusion.<br><br>Allowing a few Whenevers onto the list will probably work much better.<br><br>Part of it might be the title Whenever. It sounds like Someday/Maybe (or Dismissed or Hibernating). Maybe something with a bit more ooph, like "Next Best Use of Time". Learning's phrase "Relief Tasks" might work. They need to be things that, while not as important as the Focus tasks, are still good uses of my time, and don't risk re-activating projects that should stay in hibernation.<br><br>I like that you can only do one task on the Whenever list before returning to the Focus list. Discipline! It sounds like a good balance between the two.<br><br>I'm going to give it a try. I'll start small, with today's list (which happens to have 12 items left, all somewhat important but only some with firm deadlines), and let you know.</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go:<br><br>This idea isn't based around planning for a particular day, but rather a way to adapt any Autofocus-style system to maintain focus on tasks which might otherwise get lost in the master list.  The rule is "urgent", not "must be done today".  That might mean something that needs to be done ASAP, but will take a week.<br><br>The other automatic focus category was tasks with hard deadlines -- this was meant to keep them "on the radar" so the deadline isn't neglected.  Tasks with soft deadlines (a goal date that can slip without consequence) belong in the Whenever list, unless it's one of the "very few" that you want to promote as focus tasks for the sake of completion.<br><br>The idea behind the Focus list is for it to contain the tasks which MUST be done -- and if the Focus list is empty, that's a good thing.  That means you have flexibility to work on anything using the underlying Autofocus system's usual rules.<br><br>As far as resistance goes, the idea behind that rule was to try to break the "motivational surface tension" of high-resistance tasks by making a point of working on the one with the highest resistance (even if it's just to "get out the folder") if you come to a point where you have a list of actionable tasks where nothing "stands out" to work on.  The assumption behind that rule is that you're probably procrastinating on one or more tasks and need to force some progress, no matter how slight.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>When I'm choosing a relief task, my head simply thinks of it as giving my brain a break from the highly resistant MIT. It might even be another MIT that's easier.  If I don't choose to work on another MIT as a relief task, it's usually safe for me to choose recurring tasks that need to get done but don't blow up in my face if I let them lay dormant for a day or three.  Also, sometimes I'll push myself too hard to get a high resistance task done and I'm almost at the point of throwing something against a wall. Then I might need about 10-20 minutes of worthy relief tasks to wait until my frustration has quieted down.  In 10-20 minutes it could be one task or 5. I don't see the point of counting tasks when I'm simply biding my time until I'm ready to belly up to the dreaded task again!  If I'm really vexed (especially if I can't see what's causing it to fail), I might do an hour or so or easier one offs and recurring work until I'm ready to go back to that MIT.  Sometimes it only takes 2 or 3 minutes.  I never know.  I just work on easier stuff of take a break until my mind and body is ready to go into attack mode again!  LOL!  My only rule is to stay current or slightly ahead whenever possible. It's easy to choose daily MITs so I have focus. As long I successfully complete them, I don't care how I did it.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br>I'm not sure how this relates to the MIT/Relief Task idea.  I wasn't familiar with it.  It took a bit of searching to find that MIT means "Most Important Thing".  I guess there's some similarity, but it feels mostly different to me at first glance.  The goal here is to maintain focus on a few tasks and retain flexibility with just enough compulsion to be helpful.<br><br>Adding tasks to the Focus list indiscriminately will defeat the purpose, as you surmise.  That's why soft deadlines go into the Whenever list, no matter how important.  (In my current system, AF2NDP5, those tasks can still be prioritized within the Whenever list.)<br><br>Pretending to have hard deadlines on tasks in order to put them in the Focus list is subverting the system.  Instead, the idea is to use the "very few other tasks" rule to select maybe one (a "current initiative") or three (the "Top 3") tasks to the list, give or take.<br><br>Note that tasks on the Whenever list might be MORE important than tasks on the Focus list, though obviously those would be good candidates for the "very few" rule.<br><br>As for the name, that's just what came to mind.  Perhaps it would be better to call the list "Main" or "Master" or "Everything" or "Everything Else" or something along those lines, if the "Whenever" name has negative connotations.  It is NOT meant to be a "Someday/Maybe" list to set aside and forget; that's exactly the reason for the rule to start every day on the Whenever list.<br><br>I'm leaning toward renaming the "Whenever" list to the "Main" list, since I think that captures the intent I had better...<br><br>Anyway, if you're giving it a try, what are you using as the underlying system to process each list?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Devon<br>WOW!  Thanks for the explanation. That sounds like it would very closely fit my needs except for the rule about only one whenever task at a time.  Sometimes the structured procrastination phenomenon works wonders.  As a relief task I might make progress on a task which would ordinarily cause resistance if it wasn't up against an even worse task!  LOL!  <br><br>We do seem to think alike in that we feel compelled to make sure the important work is in our focus. It's also useful to have relief tasks so that ultimately I can accomplish more in a day rather than throw my hands in the air and give up if an MIT hits stalemate status!  LOL!<br><br>You did an excellent job creating your system. Kudos to you!</div>

<div class="content">Freedom to work on anything, rather than the next most important thing? It makes sense. The next most important thing might be another complex task, when what's really needed is a break before going back to the main task.<br><br>My first attempt at sorting today's list into two categories came to a screeching halt. 11 of 12 went to Focus. Half of them were things I'd like to do daily (e.g., exercise) -- deadline of today. A few were things I've put off for way too long, but can slide another week with no consequences. I'm going to try it again another day.</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go:<br><br>Based on Cricket's feedback, I've decided to rename the "Whenever" list to the "Main" list to better capture the intent, so I'll use that terminology from now on.<br><br>The idea behind only allowing one Main list task at a time is to prevent a slew of low-priority tasks to be used as tools for procrastination, if you might be wanting to avoid something on the Focus list.  But you're allowed to stay on the Focus list as long as you want, since it theoretically contains the tasks you should be focused on.<br><br>Note that the rule on having to take action before switching lists only applies if there ARE any actionable tasks on the list.  If everything on the Focus list is something that you can't reasonably be taking action on, then you can go right back to the Main list.  But if there's something actionable and you're just avoiding it, that's when the "most resistance" rule applies.  But you can still just "get out the folder", or write down a GTD-style "next action" perhaps.  (With a time estimate for that next action, I'd suggest.)  Even if it's a token action, it's better than nothing, right?<br><br>Thanks for the kudos, I really like AF2NDP5 and hope that others will too.  Time will tell if anyone will give it a try, but so far one person has agreed to.  (Yes, I know the name sucks, but I'd rather let the system evolve first, then come up with a name for the final system.)</div>

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br>If you've been working on a Focus task and need a break, you're not required to stay on the Focus list for the next task -- after looking through it, if nothing stands out, then you switch back to the Main list and select something.  If what you need is a "relief task", that's where you're likely to find one.<br><br>As for sorting your list, if you have tasks that you want to do today but don't HAVE to do (such as exercise), put those on your Main list.  The Focus list isn't for self-imposed deadlines, but for hard deadlines you have no control over, such as filing your taxes by April 15.  And for things that are truly urgent, drop-everything must-do tasks.  Not for everything you're behind schedule on.<br><br>How many of your 12 tasks are truly urgent?  How many have a hard deadline you can't control with consequences you need to avoid?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Devon<br>If I didn't already have my system, I'd certainly give it a go. In fact, much of your system embraces the same principles. We just want to make sure that we are current with our important work and free enough to choose work we like.  For my mind, I like choosing MITs and get the option of quitting for the day (or an early week) if I get all my MITs done. That's my carrot....freedom to do what I like along with being responsible. When I'm able, I've gone into overdrive just to end the week early guilt free or even a couple of weeks (surgery).  I just want to keep that nagging out of my brain. It interferes with my higher thinking....or lower thinking when I want that!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Oops, you're right - Learning's version is just a few MITs. Your Focus list can be longer -- as long or as short as it ends up when you sort the tasks.<br><br>Of my 12 tasks, none are urgent today. The family would suffer if I put off 5 of more than a few days. Others would suffer if I put off 2 for too long. And I'd not meet my personal goals if I put off 5. Looking at them like that, maybe I have too many personal goals. Something to consider.<br><br>Your Focus list is much shorter than I'd thought at first.<br><br>I'm going to play around with up to four lists and see what happens. First attempt:<br><br>1. Focus. Has a firm deadline.<br><br>2. Milestone. Intermediate deadlines for a project with a hard deadline. (Hmm, those are already on the Focus list.) Also for personal goals, such as exercise and studying.<br><br>3. Whenever. (Mostly reading and hobbies I can pick up or drop easily.

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>You must have an iron will.  If I had exercise, reading, hobbies et al on my work list, I'd surely resent my work far more or  I'd surely cave in and do them instead. LOL!  I intentionally choose more lukewarm breaks such as visiting a few allowable internet visits, walk my dog, listen to music while I work and music that doesn't cause me to want to pick up an instrument, etc...I know what activities can put me into a trance.  For the sake of my work, it's best for me to keep them separate from my work hours.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Exercise needs to be on the list, or I won't do it. I have goals for several of my hobbies, to keep my mind stretching, but those often slide. In theory, working on them will keep up my stamina for when I return to work. In practice, though, they often slide and I wonder where my day went. My problem isn't too much that I have to do for others, but the inability to get done what I choose. Fingers crossed that, when a paycheque rides on my ability to focus, it will be easier.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Now I see why you might have better willpower than I have. Our "problems" are the exact opposite.  I can always do what I choose to do unless my disabilities make it absolutely impossible.  If the work is heavy with resistance, it's much harder but I can still do it.  My greatest problem is what I have to do for others. They are the only work on my list that causes resistance. I would never choose high resistance work for own projects.  If I chose the project, even if I fail several times before successfully completing it, that doesn't cause long term resistance.  When I get overwhelmed or stalemated temporarily, I want to go back and try again even when it vexes me.  I chose the challenge.  OTOH, meeting responsibilities that are totally inimical to my thinking process (think boredom and tedium) are NEVER chosen my me. These are invariably responsibilities I must meet.  Over 90% of all my mental resistance would disappear if I no longer had to do required work.  LOL!  If I decide it's an MIT, I'll do it but it's sometimes an arduous, uphill battle to the end.  I'm always glad when my responsibilities are finished for the day.  Phew!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I can attest to the fact that good pay for work can be a fabulous incentive.  When I was in the workforce, sometimes I'd work 17 hour shifts Friday, Saturday and Sunday on top of my 40 hour workweek. At that point, exhausting myself like that was almost always for the money. Sometimes I'd put extra work on my back when I opened doors for me. In fact, when I was crunching through mountains of work during those 17 hour crunches, I'd mentally attach what the payoff way. It usually related to a great vacation afterwards or a new car or a better house.  Visualizing the WHY got me to stay the course (with the help of lots of coffee!) After that, I'd sleep about 9-10 hours. It was hard, blissful sleep...just to start at my day job.  But it was worth it. In my job, the money was mostly in side jobs, not the salary.<br><br>Good luck with your new job.  I hope you enjoy it!</div>

<div class="content">Cricket,<br><br>I'm not suggesting that exercise shouldn't be on your list, only that it doesn't need to be on the Focus list that I'm suggesting.  The criteria was urgency or hard deadlines, not importance.  (Of course, that's just my current theory -- maybe there's a better way!)<br><br>I'll be curious how your experiment with four lists turns out, though you could just as easily name them (1) Must, (2) Should, (3) Can and (4) Won't. :)<br><br>In my experience, every time I try to make a separate Someday/Maybe list, everything on it gets forgotten forever.  Therefore, I've tried to avoid it with AF2NDP5.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Devon<br>I disagree with your assertion that exercise shouldn't be on Cricket's Focus List.  In most cases, Importance trumps urgency.  If you allow urgency to always rule your prioritization, you can get mired in busywork.  Cricket stated that she needs for it to appear on her list. Otherwise, she won't do it.  I'm surmising that since she put it on her focus list, it's a habit that has much importance for her.  Many times, I've used my CI to fine-tune habits or learn something new. I admire Cricket for prioritizing learning a habit that's obviously so beneficial to her well-being.  I'd rather have good fitness habits than being led by the nose by all and sundry urgencies. She's appealing to higher principles and quality of life issues. I find her efforts to be laudable.</div>

<div class="content">I was giving Cricket feedback on how THIS idea works, and for this idea, exercise doesn't meet the criteria I was suggesting for a Focus list, since it isn't urgent and doesn't have a hard deadline.<br><br>As I recall, Mark's recommendation for things like exercise is to block out regular times on your calendar for regular commitments (such as exercise), rather than treating it as a to-do task.<br><br>Also consider that my system (AF2NDP5) already has prioritization, and if she uses that system, she could certainly mark exercise at a top priority level.  I'm just saying it belongs in the Main list, not the Focus list.  (Unless she wants to include it as one of the "very few" other tasks to promote from the Main list.)<br><br>Mind you, I'm not claiming this Focus/Main list idea is the best approach to take -- it's an idea that I only just thought of the other day, and it may not pan out well, for all I know.  For now, I'm giving it a chance before considering more tweaks to the system.<br><br>This idea isn't about ignoring importance, nor about letting urgency trump importance.  It's about recognizing that you can only focus on a short list, not a long one.  You can have a lot of critically-important tasks on your Main list, but if you automatically put them all on your Focus list, it defeats the purpose entirely.  (Cricket said she assigned 11 of 12 to the Focus list when she tried sorting her tasks!)<br><br>The idea behind the "very few" rule was to allow 1-3 of the MOST important tasks (whatever they may be) to occupy the Focus list, because that's few enough to actually focus on!  You can always promote another important task from the Main list every time you finish one of those "very few" tasks on the Focus list.<br><br>I also admire Cricket for prioritizing exercise in her life; I haven't managed to do that.  I'm just saying that by default, it belongs in the Main list, according to THIS particular idea.  If she doesn't care for this idea, she can always take another approach.  I may end up discarding this approach and come up with something different for AF2NDP6, but for now it seems workable.</div>

<div class="content">Arghhh! Two hours ago I wrote a long reply, and it didn't go through! Sigh.<br><br>Reading later posts, I see a difference in the way we work. You work from your main list. I work from a day list which I create from the master list (or from a week list). The day list usually includes a mix of priorities. It's intentionally optimistic.<br><br>It's your system, so it applies to the way you work. I'm just playing at the margins.<br><br>How long is your Focus list? What time-frame does it cover? I have room in my life for several mid- and low-importance projects, although some weeks I have to focus on only the high-importance ones. Your life is probably different.<br><br>I try to block out routine times for routine tasks. Some things work best done at set times and in a set order. Even then, I like having those tasks on the day's list. It gives me flexibility if I don't finish the routine tasks in the block, or if I need to use the block for something else. Also, blocking out time for routine tasks can, if done blindly, lead to doing unimportant things just because it's the right time.<br><br>As for exercise, it's important, urgent, and has a firm (but unknown) deadline. I have middle-age creep, which increases the chance of permanent problems. I have time now to work through the "takes more energy than it gives" stage, but might not have the time later. So, it goes on my Focus list. (I don't expect it to go on yours, just saying why it goes on mine.)<br><br>I started today with an intentionally optimistic list, sorted by Daily, Focus and Other. Kept to schedule very well in the morning, but lost ground at lunch and when shopping with the kids.<br><br>I like Must, Should, Could, Won't. MSCW.<br><br>Must is urgent and important, usually but not always things for other people. Includes new routines (in moderation). Urgent means staying on schedule, not just final deadline. <br><br>Should is maintenance that can slide a bit and studying. I was going to include getting ahead of schedule here, but this category usually bloats. I'm comfortable leaving pulling ahead of schedule for the next category, since my schedules are usually conservative.<br><br>Could is getting ahead of schedule. I'm rarely in this section, so it cannot include projects that benefit from consistent effort. Those projects are either On (M or S) or Off (W).<br><br>Won't is those things I'm sacrificing now so I can finish other things more efficiently.<br><br>And now I'm thinking of Covey's four quadrants. Must is Q1. Should and Could are both Q2 (important not-urgent). Q3 doesn't exist for me -- if it's not important, it cannot be urgent. Won't is Q4 -- not urgent, and not worth doing, but might get promoted when I have time to do them right.</div>

<div class="content">It's your system. I admire the operating principles but I'll leave the rules to those why do better following rules.  <br><br>When I hear a recommendation, I'll process it.  Mark recommends scheduling exercise. That's a good recommendation but some people prefer to exercise at different times in the day. That's the way it is with rules and recommendations.  They work for some but not others.  OTOH, principles can be applied in many ways.  Example: "Vickie when I wake up I'll call you to go water skiing. It'll be about 2ish."  If what I already planned for 2-6pm isn't as enjoyable as water skiing, then I'll say, "Heck, yeah! thanks!"  When everybody is done skking, somebody says, "Let's go dancing tonight. Who's in?"  These are not scheduled exercise. It's lifestyle. <br><br>Cricket makes her list to suit her lifestyle needs.  I think she was keeping to the principles behind your rules. She simply made them work for how she best operates. OTOH, you want people to test your system.  When Mark presented AF1, I honestly tried it and failed miserably with it.  He was gracious and said thanks for giving it a go.  I love his DIT. I've been using it for years.  I changed it to suit me. He never gave me grief for now following the rules.  He said he was glad it helps me.  All I'm saying is that some people will be able to follow the rules. Maybe many more will be helped by just applying the principles.  You did a fine job with both the principles and the rules.....but I think the true power is in the great principles you employed to create your promising system.  I hope it goes well for you and whoever can benefit from it.  Nothing personal, I've always been led by principles vs rules unless I was in a situation where I was forced to follow the rules.

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br>To give you a snapshot of my current list (at work), my Main list contains 1 triple-starred task, 13 double-starred tasks, 12 single-starred tasks and 46 unstarred (low-priority) tasks.  My Focus list currently contains 1 quadruple-starred task (a long-delayed task for someone that I just elevated to a top priority), 3 triple-starred tasks (monthly report due today, a very important task that's relatively urgent which I want to focus on completing ASAP, and another important task that I'm supposed to work on before I go on vacation next week),and 1 double-starred task (an easy task which is neither important nor urgent, but seems like it should have been done long ago, so I elevated it as one of the "very few" tasks to focus on).  There are currently no unstarred or single-starred tasks on my Focus list.<br><br>So I have 72 tasks on my Main list (of varying priorities) and 5 tasks on my Focus list (almost all high-priority).  My intent is not to work exclusively from the Focus list, but simply to make sure those tasks are guaranteed more attention in the task selection process and are therefore more likely to be selected.  I would rather if the Focus list were shorter, but at the moment I have to juggle some high priorities.<br><br>As for the time-frame of my Focus list, the concept doesn't really apply.  There is no time frame for the Focus list except perhaps ASAP.  It's not "today's list" as yours appears to be.<br><br>I see your point about blocking out time for flexible routine tasks, and I tend to agree it might be problematic.  I was just passing along what I had seen Mark say about such things.  (I think the example he used was learning a foreign language?)  Do you think the Focus rule should be modified to account for this?  My concern is that this could cause the list to become unfocused as too many tasks end up on it.  Having a third list is clearly an option, but is that needed complexity?  I'm not sure about this.<br><br>Your mention of "rarely" being in the Could section reminds me of the neglected "Someday/Maybe" list again.  That's part of what worries me about separating Should from Could.  Using AF2NDP5, I can use prioritization within the main list to give the shoulds more attention without completely neglecting the coulds (and even the won'ts)...</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go:<br><br>Rules worry me somewhat, as I don't want to feel like the rules of a system are attempting to put me into a straitjacket, especially rules which say you MUST do something.  It doesn't take much compulsion for me to resist the system itself.<br><br>I completely agree that what works for one person won't necessarily work for the next, and several of Mark's systems don't work for me at all.  Of all of Mark's systems, AF1 seems to have the most staying power, and if it just dealt with urgent tasks better, it would be ideal for many people.  A number of systems since then have attempted to keep what's good about AF1 while improving on it, usually finding that's easier said than done.  AF2NDP5 is my latest attempt, following up on several attempts by Mark and nuntym.  I'm happy with it so far, but I'm always open to ideas for improvement, so AF2NDP6 is quite foreseeable, even though I have no idea what I might want to change.<br><br>I'm sorry if you feel like I was giving Cricket grief for not following the rules.  I wasn't -- I was trying to clarify that what she was doing was something different than what I was suggesting, and therefore she might get different results.  If she finds a way that works better for her, more power to her!  I'd like to hear what she does and maybe try it myself.  She and I seem to think alike and have similar needs from a system, so if she comes up with a beneficial tweak, I'm quite interested.  I consider all of these systems to be works in progress, open to improvement.<br><br>I absolutely agree that principles are more important than rules, and the principle behind the rule I was discussing with Cricket is that you can only focus on a few things, and allowing too many items into the Focus list runs the risk of turning it into an Unfocused list, at which point you might as well not even bother with having the separate Focus list in the first place...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Devon<br>Firstly, I apologize for misinterpreting your words and intentions.<br><br>Secondly, I'm not saying that rules don't have their benefits in certain contexts. I only wish that I was better at following rules made by others.  Unfortunately, I'm fairly independent so I usually just quietly follow my own rules after I've given the rules a try.  If my actions are under somebody else's watch, (i.e. a salaried job, driving on roads, paying taxes in a timely manner, etc.) I can follow rules where it's smart to do so.  LOL!<br><br>Maybe my brain is too quirky to blend in with rule following folks.  I'm sure that following the rules makes their life easier for them to function.  Although I got top grades in school, I was banished from the class because I couldn't function and learn like the others.  Ergo, I'm used to making up my own rules because I wasn't closely supervised or monitored growing up unless it was something an authority figure wanted me to learn or obey.  LOL!  I rarely got punished for wrong-doing but I got punished plenty for thinking differently. LOL!  Maybe I'm used to governing myself because I am more successful that way.  Don't go by me!  LOL!  I truly think you're on to some great ideas here.</div>

It put me in the hot spot with my bosses, but ultimately, they saw that I accomplished far more with better results when I did things my way and finally left me alone knowing that my crazy methods get great results for me and for them.  LOL!<br><br>Instead of just drawing, sometimes I'd lay my head on my desk to recreate the surgery I saw and envision what the surgeon wanted to project with my work.  I'd play rock and roll or reggae to juice up my thoughts.  LOL!  True, it looked bad but helped tremendously to get the thing done faster than if I wasted time doing thumbnail sketches.  LOL!

<div class="content">Hi Deven,<br><br>Don't worry, I didn't hear "grief for not following the rules".<br><br>And, after all is said and done, I don't think the system will work for me. However, it's given me better questions to ask before putting each task on my Day list.<br><br>I'll put a Focus list in the front of the Master list (from which I create my Day list). This would be a good page to list my Roles. It would force me to pay attention to each one while creating my Day list. Yes, the Focus list will be longer than yours, but covers more parts of my life.<br><br>When creating my Day list, I'm going to ask more questions:<br><br>Would this project go on an overall Focus list? If it wouldn't, maybe it shouldn't be on the Day list, or maybe it's part of a larger worthy project I haven't consciously identified.<br><br>Do I really have time in the next few weeks/months to give it the attention it needs to be worthwhile, or would it be better to focus on already-active projects?<br><br>What will happen if I don't work on it today? Will it fall behind? Will I lose momentum on an important project?<br><br>Then, when picking what to do in the next hour, use the same questions.<br><br>I'm already doing some of that informally.<br><br>+++<br><br>Why I don't think your system (as I understand it) will work for me:<br><br>It opens all the possibilities on the Master list every time I leave the Focus list. This risks reviving too many projects, and going through the Master list takes time. Best done less frequently). Your stars might solve this problem.<br><br>It's tempting to spend time reprioritizing tasks that have no chance of making the Focus list in the near future, and even more time fine-tuning the stars on tasks that are close to being added. A long list might be worth dividing into "likely to go on Focus list soon" and "won't go on the Focus list until after year end." Beyond that, though, it's re-organizing with no benefit.<br><br>It doesn't look ahead to see if the day (and week) will be balanced, and doesn't tell me in advance if I'll have enough time to finish what I plan.<br><br>Without a time-frame, it feels like as I finish the Focus list I'll find more things to put on it, and the list will never end. (An open list.) I'll be stuck doing things on the Focus list and then burn out, meanwhile ignoring things that are "almost" on the list. The feeling is partly inaccurate because Sharpening the Saw (Covey's phrase) is important enough to go on the Focus list fairly often. It's partly accurate because declaring something "important enough for the Focus list" turns it into a chore.<br><br>+++<br><br>"Could" is things that, while I'm happy to let them sit, don't need long-term commitment to be worth reactivating. Thinking about it, I do spend a fair amount of time in Could. Most reading is in this category. I keep my Hibernating page tidy, so I'm not afraid of losing things on it. <br><br>+++<br><br>Yes, your Focus list is much shorter than my Day list. Am I right in saying urgent tasks stay on it until done, and new urgent tasks can be added any time. Non-urgent but important tasks stay on it until done, and can only be added when you expect to have time to make significant progress. ?<br><br>+++<br><br>I'm mixed about using a time frame when creating the Focus list. A time frame keeps the list smaller. It can have less-important items that will be of most benefit done early. On the other hand, it makes it easier to say, "Yes, that's an important project, but not today," repeatedly.<br><br>Nothing's perfect.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Thank you so much for articulating it for me. Sometimes it's even more bizarre than that. There's a part of my brain that I'm not privy to. When it finally has it's eureka moment, it gives a feeling that somewhere in my head I know what to do.  I just get the supplies and go to my desk or my easel and pick up an implement. It's like I'm in a trance with this hidden part of my brain directing me. The real me is just passively enjoying the ride.  It's almost like watching another artist painting or drawing. You don't know what they're thinking. You're just watching them produce.  LOL!  I can't explain it but I live for those times.  I can't do anything to make it happen. The best that I can do is gather information, doodle, research, whatever.  When it clicks, I know it. I turn off my active mind and let it do it's thing.  LOL!  During the early stages it does in fact feel like I'm watching a film and I'm the narrator. Spontaneously that hidden part of my brain will stop the flick and saturate my consciousness with the answer. Of course, I don't always know what the answer is but when all thought abruptly stops, I know that the answer is there.  I just have to abdicate my active control and allow it to happen.  LOL! When that would happen, I'd feel VERY GUILTY because I was getting credit for something I didn't really have control over.  But it was futile to try to explain the phenomenon to anybody. I didn't want them to think I was crazy.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Learning, no need to feel guilty! You did a lot of work so that part of your brain had all the tools, information, and space it needed. You did a lot more than your coworkers to learn anatomy and find out up front what the authors wanted to show.<br><br>(In the middle ages, they taught anatomy by having a servant dissect the cadaver while the instructor read from Aristotle. Anything that didn't match Aristotle's words was called an abnormality or worse -- even things that were in every single cadaver.)<br><br>I can see, though, why your boss's boss would be worried. You didn't use the method that most people find works best to unleash their creativity. You had a blank page for much of the time. Your boss didn't get a chance to help you pick the best view.<br><br>Some people are stuck on thumbnails because That's The Way It's Done. Others (like me) find they open the door. Blank page to final product is intimidating. What if I spend hours on something, only to realize I missed a key concept? What if I don't understand the assignment or know what the author is trying to show? (A valid concern, especially for their boss) What if I think of a better solution after investing all that time? A dozen thumbnails are quick and solve all those problems.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Thank you for assuaging some of my guilt. I went the extra mile to learn the anatomy of some of the animals while the others depended mostly on either the medical photographs taken by their department or by what they saw in the operating room theater. My beef was that you couldn't see it all or understand just by watching it.  They had MSMI (master of science medical illustration.  Many took premed for their undergraduate b.s.  Some of the courses are shared by 1st and 2nd year medical students.  That includes cadaver dissection....but only a human or a pig usually.  But this is all related to human beings.  Because of my quirky brain, I had to UNDERSTAND what I was drawing, especially animals whose anatomy is different (especially if the physiology was different as well.)  Trust me, their education is grueling, expensive and hard to get admitted.  There are few universities offering an accredited MSMI.  One of the ladies got her MSMI at Johns Hopkins no less plus she had a Ph.D. in something to do with oral biology. (She was head of the Dental Research Medical Illustration Department.) My boss's formal medical illustration education was supplanted with 2 tours of duty as a Naval Corpsman attached to the Marines Recon Unit in the Viet Nam War (Most dangerous war duty) Sometimes he was the only guy who could do any surgery in the field after he was transported down from a chopper.  He knew surgery first hand!   Naaaa, I just wanted to understand the animals' anatomy first hand so it would be easier to understand and be able to do what the surgeon wanted of me (in case some of what he wanted in his drawings were hidden by blood or other organs.)  I had total respect for all the artists and photographers in that department. Both of the medical photographers were also trained for medical visual arts plus they were corpsmen in the Viet Nam war also.  Truth be told, I was forced to make a choice by the dean.  Either drop out and take my courses again or get expelled.  It was punishment because they had some film of me on campus during the Protest strikes. Eh...they did it on purpose.  I was carrying a 3.9 and they waited until final exam week to do this to me even though the protests were months before.  I was NOT going to pay another 20 plus K to take the same semester again. (This was the early 70's. Now it's about 50-60K.  I wasn't that rich!  LOL....I didn't care. I like the challenge of studying extra to learn my assignments.  The doctors appreciated it also.  My boss also did lots of extra beyond the 8-4:30 day.  That's why we made so much extra money. Plus I LOVED the experience of combining science with art.  If there was such a thing as an art position coupled with mathematics, I would have loved that even more!  LOL! (I minored in mathematics) Doctors from other departments came to us because their artists weren't very ambitious. Government workers....pfffft!  LOL! <br>Even though they weren't particularly ambitious, I still respected all of them.  It's a difficult job. I don't blame them for not wanting to get immersed in it.  LOL!  I ended up quitting.  It was too much because I couldn't ever do 8-4:30 and leave the docs hanging. In fact, I'd be humiliated if doctors had to go to artists outside your department because you won't life a finger after 4:30pm.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I was never afraid to shred my work and start again IF my brain clicked and had THE ANSWER.  This doesn't include having to do work over again because the docs would approve work and change their minds sometimes ad nauseam! (I made plenty of money off those chronic wafflers!  LOL!)  I'm talking about just doing a rendering the usual way and then that thing would spontaneously happen in my brain.  At first my boss would go ape **it when he saw me do it "What are you doing? You've been working on that for almost a week and it's due at the end of the day!"  I'd say, "Trust me, It will be done." Then the trance would get it done.  After a few times of seeing this, my boss would sometimes just watch me do it. LOL!  He'd shake his head.  That's part of the reason I got the nickname the 11th hour artist.  I was fast....once I truly felt like I understood it and my brain gave me a picture in my head or just do it for me. Unfortunately, I had no control over making it happen.  I had to grind out lots of work the regular way. LOL!<br><br>A few times I did non medical outside contracts.  It was a crap shoot.  Most of the time they had lousy taste but I'd do for the money.  I'd NEVER sign my name or my mark to those. I'd do a different signature/mark so nobody would know it was me!  LOL!  Those most embarrassing one was a psychedelic album cover for an acid rock group. It was horrendous looking but the rockers loved it!  That is going with me to my grave!  (I did like the couple of parties they had but I never used the damn concert tickets.  My friends would have ribbed me for the rest of my life!  LOL!)  Menu covers and romantic novel covers were also embarrassing....yuck! I tried to steer clear of them. A lot of money can be made if you're willing to please people with bad taste!  LOL!  Then I did oil and pastel portraits.  That's another area I ditched.  They want their good features to be realistic and their bad features to be altered, their age and weight decreased also!  LOL!  Medical art didn't involve all that pandering to peoples' taste. My experience with gallery showings were disastrous!  Not my kind of people!  LOL! <br><br>Did you also get stuck with getting contracts forcing you to use bad taste?  I just didn't have the personality for it. *blush*</div>

<div class="content">Melanie,<br><br>Sorry I didn't respond to your review before now; I was on vacation from August 6 through August 15 and have been too busy to get to it...<br><br>I'm glad you enjoyed using the system and found it effective.  I'd be interested to discuss the issues you had with it; I'm always interested in improving the system!<br><br>I have to wonder if calling the Main list a "Relief" list may have changed the feel of the system?  It wasn't my intention for that list to contain recreational tasks to provide relief from the Focus list, though it certainly can!  My intention was that MOST tasks would be on the Main list, with just a few on the Focus list.  My original name of "Whenever" list was to reflect that these tasks -- while potentially important -- didn't necessarily NEED to be focused upon, because they aren't urgent and don't have a hard deadline.  However, I realized the name "Whenever" seemed to imply "Who Cares?" a little too much (as "Someday/Maybe" does), so I decided Main list was a better name.  Personally, I wouldn't call it a Relief list, but to each his/her own!<br><br>You said that this system gave you a true focus list and helped you accomplish non-deadlined tasks.  Great!  That was the idea, and the intended result of the separate Focus list.  Allowing "very few" regular tasks into the Focus list was intended to allow for either a Current Initiative or Top 3 to focus on completion of those tasks, while keeping the Focus list short enough for true focus on those tasks.  You also said that it gave you an alternate reward for work.  That sounds like a natural outcome of following an Autofocus-style system capturing everything.<br><br>As for the things that made you crazy...<br><br>(1) "Resisted starting with the Relief list."  The idea was to ensure the Main list wasn't entirely starved for attention, which has happened for me before with a "Someday/Maybe" list.  However, I'm not sure it's really necessary or helpful, and I've found myself resisting this rule too.  I'm inclined to discard this rule, especially considering the value of the "Eat That Frog" idea...<br><br>(2) "Resisted the other rules, too."  AF2NDP5 -- what you called "Focus & Relief" -- was derived from nuntym's AF2ND (as we discussed before).  Thinking about it, I suspect the separate Focus list may obviate the need for AF2ND's approach of rewriting old tasks during the task selection process...<br><br>(3) "Difficult to identify the 3 Relief tasks on the Focus list."  That's okay, you weren't meant to distinguish or track them.<br><br>Right now I'm wondering how well stock AF1 would work with the Focus/Main list idea alone?</div>

<div class="content">Deven, thanks so much for your thorough response that had not a hint of defensiveness. I love that. <br><br>I honestly was thinking the same thing...that AF would probably function very well with a separate focus list. AF1 fans would do well to try it. I think it eliminates the need to worry about getting to the end of the list where the current/urgent tasks reside. It would also reduce anxiety about the size of the main list. With time, the list will be weeded anyway with your directions to eliminate tasks regularly. It's amazing how many tasks become irrelevant given a little time. Having a focus list also keeps us from tackling those main list tasks that really shouldn't be attended to. Doing AF had me doing things just to do them, even if they were pointless.<br><br>I decided to add fun tasks to what I called the Relief list because when I was doing AF1, I sprinkled my list with things that I wanted to do like read or watch a show to keep me motivated to use the list all day long. Now I'm thinking that I would rather have built-in breaks throughout the day. I don't need the reminders for recreational time.<br><br>Thanks again for the discussion and feedback, Deven. Hope you had a wonderful vacation.</div>

<div class="content">I hope that wasn't sarcastic!  I don't feel any reason to be defensive about it; nothing is a magic bullet that works for everyone, and I'm always open to ideas for improvement.  I'm just hoping to settle on a system that works well for me.  If it works well for others, all the better.  Certainly I love getting feedback from others because it stimulates thinking about how to refine and improve the system, which I'm always interested in.<br><br>If you haven't read Mark's own review of AF1 from a couple years ago, I recommend reading it:<br><br><a href="../blog/Review of the Systems Autofocus 1.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2011/1/24/review-of-the-systems-autofocus-1.html</a><br><br>One thing I've noticed over several years of reading these forums is that AF1 seems to be the system with the most "staying power", despite its known limitations.  Many people seem to love using it, find it effective and easy to use (even addictive), don't feel resistance to the system, etc.  Mark has returned to AF1 over and over again.  This suggests to me that AF1 is nearly perfect, and the "perfect" system (if there is such a thing) ought to be very similar to AF1.<br><br>Although AF2NDP5 is still rather new, I'm going to try a new system starting today, which I think I'll call AF1NDF1 for now.  (Autofocus 1, No Dismissal, Focused, version 1)  This is in my tradition of horrible acronyms for experimental systems! :)  (Mainly, I don't want to "use up" a good name until the rules are settled.  Otherwise I might call this "Stereo Autofocus" or something...)<br><br>AF1NDF1 is AF1 (sans dismissal) with a Focus list:<br><br>* Keep two lists: a long Main list containing almost everything (universal capture), and a short Focus list containing only urgent tasks, tasks with hard deadlines and up to 3 others that would otherwise belong on the Main list.  (This allows focusing on a "Top 3" or a "Current Initiative".)<br><br>* Add new items to the end of the appropriate list (usually the Main list).<br><br>* Move tasks between lists at will, subject to the limits on the Focus list.<br><br>* To select a task to work on, always start at the beginning of the Focus list and consider each task in turn until a task "stands out".

I will probably still add stars to tasks purely as visual markers to remind me of important tasks, but only to help me find good candidates to "promote" to the Focus list, and I don't think that necessarily needs to be part of the official processing rules.</div>

<div class="content">Deven, I use an AF1 variation, based on ideas different, but to certain extent similar, to yours:<br><br>1) Focus list: it is restricted to 10 items. I activate each item in strict order. When a big rock enters the focus list it will remain until finished, broken up iteration after iteration. When an item is finished, its place on the focus list is occupied by a new item selected from the Main list (see 2) and I go on working on the Focus List.<br><br>2) main list (universal capture):  It is used to collect everything and it is used to select items to be moved to the focus list, as of 1). I process the main list selecting one item for the specific page, then moving to the following page the next time a new item is needed to be added to the focus list. This has two advantages:<br>i) fast circulation of the list (due to the selection of only one item per page, than considering the following page)<br>ii) as time goes on, also the oldest items get attention, as they remain the few alone on a page, and you have to decide between dismissing or moving it to the focus list.<br>It’s a few months now I’m following these rules, and they work in a decent way.</div>

<div class="content">Nick61, that does sound similar, but how do you deal with urgent tasks?  That was always seen as the main weakness of AF1, and what I'm trying to solve here.  Also, while I don't have a strict limit on the length of the Focus list, it should hopefully be much less than 10 items, except for people with lots on their plates perhaps.<br><br>The idea behind limiting my Focus list to urgent tasks and tasks with hard deadlines was that those are the tasks you really don't want to lose in the middle of a long list.  However, because it's helpful to focus on a task or three (Current Initiative or Top 3), I figured it would be good to allow up to three extra tasks that otherwise belong in the Main list.  On the other hand, I see nothing wrong with having an empty Focus list, if there is nothing urgent and there are no hard deadlines to worry about.  Keeping an extra task or three on the Focus list is entirely optional.</div>

<div class="content">Deven:<br><br><<how do you deal with urgent tasks?>>. I put an urgent task directly on the focus list. I strongly fight to limit these cases to a minimum.<br><br><<while I don't have a strict limit on the length of the Focus list, it should hopefully be much less than 10 items>>. I have generally 2 or 3 tasks that requires quite a few hours/days to complete  (my big rocks, id est, read a 100 page technical report and make resume and comments), some recurring ordinary tasks (process email, ...) the currente initiative and a few single-shot tasks selected from the Main list: so 10 is a good number for me, but obviously could be any other number. The important thing, in my opinion, is to have not too many task, in order not to leave too much time between two consecutive esecution of the "big rocks" (the idea it to force "little and often" in contrast with "little and too seldom", as in pure AF) and, on the other hand, is to have not too few tasks in order to leave space for the execution of some one-shot tasks selected from the Main list.<br><br><<On the other hand, I see nothing wrong with having an empty Focus list, if there is nothing urgent and there are no hard deadlines to worry about.

This is the big difference between our approches: for me the Focus list *is mandatory*: I only work on it, circulating in strict order through the 10 (circa) items. It's like SMEMA, replacing 3 with 10 and using the main list to select an item to write in the focus list as soon as you finish one of the ten. Consider that when you perform that selection you are creating a fairly big time space between the selection and the subsequent execution of the item , reducing the psycological resistence to commit to a difficult/heavy tasks...as Mark explained us somewhere in the forum.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Devon<br>I think the implementation of a focus list should be used according to your abilities and needs.  Some days I might spend over 12 hours on just one project.  That's my MIT along with necessary batching/maintenance tasks.  Other days, I have a few MITs.  When I'm picking off several one offs I don't even bother writing them down on the MIT list.  I'll simply note the category. example:Accounts. The trick is to stay current or ahead with most of your work so that you can freely work on your projects plus the maintenance stuff.  For my brain, I need a focus list which has my MITs.  I don't set rules on how to create it other than having the goal to stay current and/or move forward.  Contexts change.  Therefore, I don't think having rigid rules to create a focus list would work for me. As I've stated before, my only rule for creating my MITs is to use it to help my focus on the important work. It's sort of a balancing act.  For a switch, I'll work on less resistance producing work to refresh my mind.  I get more done that way.  My big project(s) get done while I'm also staying current on all the recurring and one off jobs.  IOW, my list decides my focus.....but....(and why I don't have strict rules) if I'm in an excellent flow pattern, I'll stay with it as long as I can.  If there's other work due today, I'll usually pick that off first so that I have the freedom to devote to my project without the worry of the other necessary stuff.  If the other stuff can safely wait, I might work on the project for 10-12 hours if I'm enjoying the challenge.  That's the beauty of staying current before something becomes urgent. Problem solving, designing and other creative thinking needs a free mind....at least for me.<br><br>Summary: When rules serve me, I'll use them.  I primarily rely on my judgement to decide what my day's work is.  And I use my judgement to adjust it when it's to my benefit.  Some long jobs require a lot of time and application of thought.  When I'm lucky enough to fall into a great flow pattern, I want to have the freedom to go with it without niggling thoughts about other work that can easily wait for another opportunity.  I think nick61 and you are after the same thing. You want focus.  You'll just have to experiment to discover how to get and keep that focus in your various demands and circumstances.  I write my MITs as a day list yet I feel free to to other work as well as completing my WILL DO Today list....or not.  Once the MITs are completed, it's my choice to do whatever I want!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Deven, I was definitely not being sarcastic--one of the limitations of this medium. I have enjoyed the discussion a lot. One of the things I forgot to mention as a pro for your method was it got me into the habit of giving myself credit for unfinished tasks again. That is a big issue for me. I get frustrated if I keep working on something, but can't quit cross it off. I hope your new approach bears fruit for you.<br><br>Mark, I think the fault was mine in that I thought I was being "good" if I got everything done on the list when in actuality, deciding not to do some things can be even better.<br><br>Learning, I completely agree with you. It makes no sense to try to force yourself into a certain number of MITs when it doesn't apply. Some days I have a large number of smaller MITs and others I have one that will consume the entire day.

<div class="content">Learning as I go:<br><br>Firstly, do whatever works for you.  But when it comes to the "rules" for a Focus list that I'm using, nothing stops you from bending the rules if that works for you.  If you wanted to try this system, you could just decided that for yourself, your practice will be to add ALL of your MITs for the day to your Focus list, even if there's more than 3.  Nobody will slap your wrist for exceeding the limit, it was just meant as concrete guidance for avoiding a "Focus" list which becomes so long that it's unfocused after all.<br><br>This is pure speculation, but I suspect the Focus list becomes harder to mentally track when it exceeds the limit of how many things you can juggle in your head at once.  Melanie might know the research on this, but I seem to recall reading that the limit varies from person to person, but it's about 7 items, give or take one or two?  Personally, my goal would be to keep the Focus list below this limit whenever possible.<br><br>To give you a sense of scale, when I converted my AF2NDP5 list to an AF1NDF1 list today (rewrote everything in chronological sequence on index cards for both the Main list and the Focus list -- previously had one index card per task), I ended up with a Main list containing 71 tasks and a Focus list containing 3 tasks.  I thought of two more tasks for the Focus list, so now there's 5 on that list.  I'm hoping the size of the Main list isn't a problem, but I strongly believe that the Focus list needs to be kept short to be effective.  How short?  That answer likely varies from person to person.  I offered guidelines that I expect will work for me, and hopefully for others.  (I realize there will be times when I'm juggling a lot of things and my Focus list may have a dozen tasks, but those hectic times will be exactly when I most need that list to cope with it!)<br><br>So in summary, feel free to ignore the "rules" on what to put in the Focus list and include whatever suits you -- but don't be surprise if the Focus list isn't helpful, should it grow too long!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Devon<br>I think I was being inarticulate.  I thought you were asking if your guidelines or nick61's is more efficient. I was merely trying to relate that circumstances and abilities and moods change.  In reference to too much being on the list, you're preaching to the choir.  I time box my MIT's to be between 2-4 hours.  That assures that they will be completed or progressed according to Today's list.  That leaves me lots and lots of flexibility time wise.  I usually have difficulty completing my work because of disabilities and my genetic propensity to avoid boredom.  Maybe that's why I've always taken on lots of different projects.  To get through university faster I was taking 6 and 7 courses (18 to 23 credits) each semester.  I also had a job.  I also kept up with competing in billiards tournaments, dance contests, sports, music plus social life.  It kept me humming.  Even being disabled, I still have that same awful brain that abhors boredom.  If I didn't have my focus list odds are great that important yet boring responsibilities would be neglected or forgotten.  On days that I'm in bad pain my list is severely reduced.  I don't like having less abilities and options but that's how it is.  BUT.....on those occasions when the challenge and interest surpasses the pain I don't usually care about the focus list when I can enjoy a state of flow.  To protect these times, I stay current on boring stuff so I don't have it polluting my thoughts.  A focus list allows me to make sure I'm doing the right work.  I may have brain damage but I'm reasonably intelligent enough to know when it's wise to adjust last nights plans for a day panning out differently than I anticipated.  But, I still do my MITs unless an unforeseen change of circumstances or my abilities.  That doesn't mean that I don't need focus.  If I didn't have my focus list only God knows what I'd cook up for the day's events!  LOL!<br><br>We all have different means of helping ourselves do our work.  I personally HATE rewriting a list.  If for some reason I don't complete the list, it simply becomes part of tomorrow's list.  I'm so bad that I don't rewrite my jobs.  I've had jobs that have stayed on the list for weeks being diligently worked on and progressed.  LOL!  I just follow my project plans instead for bigger jobs.  <br><br>If I'm totally exhausted working on a project, I like doing other work to relieve my mind.  That doesn't really need breaking down too much.  I just need to cue myself on what needs doing and a focus list makes doing today's work much easier....even on day's when it's wiser to adjust my plans!  LOL!  I can work very hard but I'm highly prone to getting distracted when I'm bored or fear doing a boring task.  The focus list keeps me where I need to be.<br><br>I'm glad you started this.  I think many people here like having the benefit of using focus lists of some sort to guide their attention and efforts.  We all just have different strengths and shortcomings.  I have to short circuit resistance before it gets too powerful.  The focus list is like my ground wire.</div>

My intuition says mine, but obviously I'm biased! :)<br><br>I hate rewriting an entire list; it takes forever.  But in this case, I had to do so to switch from AF2NDP5 to AF1NDF1, because I was using one index card per task for AF2NDP5.  While this replaced the frequent rewriting with shuffling cards, I've decided I still don't like single-task cards, even though it can be quite convenient for adding extra information.  I need a bit of a window into the task list, and one task was too narrow of a view.  (This wasn't a flaw in AF2NDP5 but a tradeoff of implementing it on index cards that way.)<br><br>Unlike the AF2ND series, AF1NDF1 only requires rewriting of incomplete tasks, like AF1.  I have high hopes for this one, but I've had high hopes for most systems I've tried.

I believe Mark has said repeatedly that this provides a psychological benefit over just leaving it on the list where it was.  I'm not in a position to validate that, but it rings true to me...<br><br>Much as I like the single master list idea in AF1, I do believe having a separate Focus list may be worth the added complexity, and it's a technique that can be used with a number of base systems as starting points...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Devon<br>Thanks for the detailed reply to further explain things.  Funny coincidence.  Years before, I tried the one task per card also.  OMG, I couldn't make it work.  It only worked when I spread them out on a board so that I could have an overview in tree style hierarchy.  I just went back to categories.  I should have known.  I've always thought and learned in categories and needed an overview to truly understand.  Luckily, I found this site. Mark helped me out of a backlog.  He did such a fine job that I got into DIT.  The principles are strong and the rules he gave supported the principles.  Since I need an overview, I changed it to weekly (or whatever overview I need) from which I can confidently choose daily focus.  His CI is excellent.  Because of my kaleidoscopic mind loving several projects to ward off boredom, his CI helped me to have a clear focus and daily progress on at least one project.  It came to serve as a pacer car for my other projects.  I already did checklists but I can't maintain on just a daily checklist.  That was unnecessarily hogging up too much time spent on the bundling.  I do better to choose those as MITs WILL DO and let the others wait their turn.  The GREATEST principle of DIT is commitment vs interest, at least for me.  I've always liked having a variety of projects to focus on to prevent boredom.  The commitment vs interest taught me how to LIMIT my project base to only 8-10 projects at a time with CI pacing all of them.  <br><br>Because my version of Mark's DIT has been serving me so well, (since 2007) I have no interest in changing something that works so well.  Part of the reason it works so well for me is all the years habituating it.  LOL!  Much less decision making and no learning.  LOL!  Sometimes I'll play around with workarounds to help me with resistance.  I like to time box my MITs.  When I have high resistance I'll add silly rules as a challenges that I can try to win.  I might even add If-Then rewards.  example: If I do 2 hours of important yet crappy boring work, I'll earn X.....BUT if I do 4 hours of it I'll earn X x 3!  LOL!  Sometimes I'll use the reward money to outsource another boring crappy job!  LOL!<br><br>I really like how you're building your system in layers and adjusting it via experimentation results and listening to feedback.  I admire you for that.  I was lucky.  I just used Mark's DIT template plus resistance tips I learned from Mark and the posters.  Besides, you wouldn't want my data.  I'm an unusually hard case with resistance.  Most of my effort is to get them out of the way.  Then I can expend my efforts on more interesting work......or leisure!  <br><br>I hope you find a good rule set/guidelines that fits your abilities and workload.  Pssst....some days you might need to make adjustments to make the day successful.  Don't think of that as breaking a rule.  Think of it as an executive over-ride!  LOL!</div>

Of course, I might never be able to beat your present system for your own use, but you can always revert to your present system if you test something which turns out to be inferior for you.

<div class="content">In regard to focus and the "focus list", here are some things I've been finding very useful.<br><br>1 - I find it best to have ONE focus item - something I carry around with me in my soul, something I ponder and worry about, something that I preoccupy myself with.   <br><br>2 - If I can't clearly say what the ONE thing is that I am currently focused on, then my ONE focus is to GET CLARITY.   Get away from the computer and from lists, get a blank piece of paper, and write out the competing priorities, the different pressures and objectives.   Then think hard about it, and identify the ONE KEY THING that I need to get done in the next week or two.   Then stay focused on that.   <br><br>3 - Usually, for me, a list of items that has been generated over the last few days or weeks just isn't fresh and intense enough for this kind of deep focus work.   Since I've been using this approach, whenever I refer to a list like that, I find myself getting distracted and unfocused and lose the drive and momentum that I've already built up internally.    The items are dead on a list, rather than alive in my mind.   <br><br>4 - "Little and often" can be a great tool.   But I think having several focus items on a list leads too easily to "too little and not often enough".  If it's focus work, then it requires more time than we naturally allocate.<br><br><br>In other words, I'm bouncing back and forth between my main focus on one hand, and a short list of misc tasks on the other hand.   It seems similar in many ways to the Focus/Whenever approach but it feels more focused and more agile to me.<br>I'm not saying this is "the way it's gotta be" - different people find different things that work for them.

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Good points, thanks for weighing in!  It sounds like you mentally maintain a "Current Initiative", which is certainly a powerful tool.<br><br>Clearly there's no single system that works equally well for everyone, but I have definitely noticed a significant fondness for AF1 across a broad swath of users, including Mark himself.  However, everyone agrees that AF1 is weak at handling urgent tasks, which can be very important for people who have to juggle urgent priorities on a regular basis.<br><br>Note that the Focus list I'm using here is NOT about "focus work" per se.  It's about focusing the LIST on a handful of tasks that need regular attention.  They might be small, simple tasks that just need to be done ASAP.  Or you might have a "Current Initiative" on the Focus list that needs "little and often" work -- or a heavy task that DOES demand a large chunk of focused attention.  The real purpose of the Focus list is to identify a FEW tasks that need to remain "on the radar" at all times.  Clutter that radar too much, and it won't work.<br><br>The hypothesis I'm testing with AF1NDF1 relates to AF1 and AF2.  While AF1 was seen as great overall, but weak on urgent tasks, AF2 was somewhat the reverse -- great at urgent tasks, but not so great overall because old tasks would tend to be forgotten.  My hypothesis is that AF2 worked so well for urgent tasks because it always started the task selection process with the most recent task each time, and that urgent tasks were usually recent (or recently rewritten when working "little and often"), and that tasks were more likely to be selected for action if they were considered more frequently.<br><br>My priority tweaks to AF2ND were based on the same principle (making sure priority tasks are considered more frequently), but I think AF1NDF1 is a simpler approach that feels like an improvement to me, so I'm trying it.  The idea is that scanning the Focus list every time you start task selection will give AF2's benefits to those few tasks, while returning to the Main list to continue scanning will give AF1's benefits in general...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Deven<br>I heartily apologize for misspelling your name.<br><br>Don't give me any credit for my system.  I simply used the blueprint of DIT and amended it to a weekly overview, recurring batches in different intervals rather than doing it all daily and since I have always learned and understood via overview and categories you could say it also has GTD overtones.  Before the accident, I didn't really have any system.  I habituated most of the recurring stuff and simply used my calendar to for appointments and timeboxing.  I can't do that anymore because I'm disabled.  To effectively use a calendar, one has to be mentally and physically fit to keep to the schedule.  Before my cognitive rehab, I was living in a total fog!  Still the benefits of it is glitchy.  When other parts of my brain have to do the work for the damaged parts, it isn't always reliable.

That's why I need to have a focus list.  With horrible short term memory issues and processing glitches my success depends on having the MITs so my day doesn't get totally derailed!  LOL!

AF series assumes that ability.  I don't have it.  I get more done when I have a flexible plan. Most importantly, it helps me strategize getting past resistance and staying on course overall.  AF made me feel like a person trying to do a puzzle with all the pieces turned face down.  LOL!<br><br>Most people don't have my stupid liabilities. My version of DIT downplays my liabilities enough to get my work done.  That's all that matters to me.  LOL!<br><br>For what it's worth, I like your AF version most of all......because it has a focus list!  Mark's AF4 is actually quite similar in spirit.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Even though I can't use AF series, I, too, like keeping several projects moving simultaneously.  Sometimes rotating projects allows me the space to process what's I've accomplished and to evaluate and maybe hypothesize my next outcome.  For me anyway, having a few projects/interests simultaneously serves the same purpose as doodling during a boring lecture or multitasking during a boring phone conversation.  It gives my brain added stimulation to prevent it from getting bored.  If boredom causes my brain to get restless, then I'm most prone to looking for and successfully finding distractions.  LOL  Mark's DIT teaches commitment versus interest.  To be frank, I'll sometimes give a trial period to see if a project captivates my interest.  Once it does, it turns into a commitment.  It's hard to keep the amount of projects I'm working on down to a maximum of 8-10 projects, but it really helps to ensure progress.  If left to my own devices, who knows how many half done projects I'd have.  LOL!  I used to schedule them, but now I just rotate them with one getting the main attention.  <br><br>I wouldn't necessarily pay heed to some of the advice.  If you're a naturally curious person, you can't help but have many interests (unless you're caught up in hyperfocus! LOL)  I personally admire you for having such diverse interests. I'm sure that you are a very interesting person.</div>

<div class="content">I'm either interesting or shallow, depending how you look at it. I carry most of my interests well beyond what most people do, but then hang out with people who are much, much better at it than I am and then I stall. I need external deadlines to keep moving. I miss how productive I was back in school. Tons of deadlines. Mind you, it was also easier to say, "That has to wait for summer or graduation."</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>LOL! but none of your posts are in the least bit shallow.  I always find your posts to be both thoughtful and informative.  I agree with you about hanging around people are more knowledgeable in certain areas.  For me anyway, I seem to learn much faster that way as opposed to being totally in the dark. First I'd need to find out some information to lead me in the direction of what knowledge and skill sets are most important and sometimes what order to learn them.  Just finding out where to start can be challenging.  With friends who know this already, one off-hand question can save me hours and hours of research!  LOL!  Their answers provide enough bread crumbs to lead me in the right direction without being too much of a pest.  LOL!  Even just watching them teaches me much!  Intelligence and/or mastery of any kind is always quite inspirational. Plus witnessing it gives you confidence that you can learn/master it also.<br><br>I agree with you about school semesters help carve time frames versus a career that is a more incremental progression.  when I took classes at night or on weekends while I worked, it seemed to provide that same benefit.  Even if I was 60+ hours a week, I'd still get excited about a semester break. LOL!  It's funny how we're excited to end the semester yet looking back, it felt really fulfilling to learn. LOL!  I still can't figure out why that happens!  LOL!  I feel the same way about the seasons.  If I lived in a one season area, I'd probably have to learn new ways to organize my life!  LOL!<br><br>I also agree that external deadlines are easier to keep.  The plus side of making our own deadlines is the flexibility we can allow ourselves.  Sometimes I'll estimate that the learning curve will be X difficulty and Y time to learn it and Z time to assimilate it into rote response.  I'm ALWAYS wrong with my guesses!  LOL!  I love it when it's quicker and easier than I thought and disappointed when I'm learning more slowly than I anticipated.  LOL!  Since my brain is defective, I just take it on faith that I'll never remember anything reliably.  On the lucky perchance that I do remember it, I'm grateful....but I don't expect it.  LOL!  I always write down what I think I might need to know again.  Example: I have an index card with instructions how to reset the clock in my auto.  Twice a year I'm reminded that I didn't remember.  That card is well worn!  LOL!  Nowadays I wouldn't likely pass any classes that would require rote recall!  LOL!<br>I always enjoyed taking classes until the auto wreck.  Learning always keeps life feeling fresh, yeah?  I do miss that feeling....</div>

Over a year ago, I was experimenting with my own Autofocus variant (based on AF1, AF2, nuntym's Context Autofocus, GTD and ideas of my own) that used categories, but it was just too complex for what I want.

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br>As an open list with universal capture, an AF1 list can grow to significant size.  (Seraphim was an extreme case, of course!)  If you refuse to ever delete anything, the list might grow without bound, but at least you'll consider everything eventually.  And in reality, if you neglect a task for long enough, it often becomes unnecessary anyhow!  So I really don't have a problem, personally, with just deleting things as I notice they've become irrelevant.  Mark's systems often include a dismissal process, but I prefer incremental deletion.<br><br><< I can't choose just 5 things to focus on. I've set several projects aside, to pick up after more-urgent projects are done.

Consider it retroactively added to the AF1NDF1 rules. :)<br><br>As for picking up to 3 tasks from the Main list to "promote" to the Focus list, that isn't meant to imply that those are the only things you would work on, not at all.  It's just supposed to be things that you specifically want to complete ASAP, but the limit is to keep the Focus list from growing to an unreasonable size.  (Too much beyond 5-9 tasks will likely become an Unfocused list instead!)<br><br>The intent of this Focus list is NOT that you should be spending all or most of your time working on those tasks.  It's only intended to remind you frequently of those tasks so they don't get lost in the Main list.  If the tasks on the Focus list don't "stand out", then you'll end up spending most of your time on the Main list, and that's fine.  It's supposed to focus the LIST, not your time.<br><br>So, how can I convince you to help me with testing? :D</div>

<div class="content">+ JMJ +<br><br>@ Deven: I can't believe you have developed that system I thought of into this! Fascinating! :D <br><br>I have been doing a system quite similar in principle to this, mainly because of your. insistence on how good having a dashboard is, but the "dashboard" changes everyday. I just can't stand static dashboards that have the same items for more than one day. I've also quit with arbitrary (in my mind) algorithms, like in what order should I process items or whatnot. I am however using question based algorithms now (similar to Mark's FV), which I think are much less arbitrary and make more sense. Finally, I do not any dismissal algorithm; instead, I am using on the oldest items the same question-based algorithm used in processing the list. <br><br>Materials: notebook, pen<br><br>I. How tasks are entered <br>1. Each item is listed separately with margins to the left and right for marks.<br>2. At the end of the day, the list is closed with a line and dated. Tasks for the next day are written below this line. <br><br>II. Processing the List<br>1. At the beginning of the day, ask yourself, "What SHOULD I be doing this day?" Mark such items with an arrow at the LEFT margin. These are the "Pre-Priority" items.<br>2. Looking at the Pre-Priority items, ask yourself, "Of these, what CAN I do today?" Those that you deem to be doable today are to be left alone, while those that seem to be not doable today are to be crossed out and rewritten at the end of the list, or written in other places like a someday/maybe list or calendar, or not if you deem them not needed anymore. The remaining marked items are now "Priority" items.<br>3. (Optional, but I find this to be very helpful) Looking at the Priority items, ask yourself, "Which of these items can I do within the next few hours/time period (for example, morning, afternoon, evening, errand trip)?" Those Priority items that fall to this question have their arrows (remember, at the LEFT margin) marked with a heavy dot at the tail end. These are now "High Priority" items. <br>4. Now choose from your list ANY item (Priority, High Priority, or otherwise) that you are going to do NOW, and mark it with an arrow at the RIGHT margin. After doing, cross out the item and rewrite at the end, if needed marked again as a Priority (arrow at the LEFT) or High Priority (arrow with heavy dot at the LEFT). <br>5. The Priorities algorithms can be done again for any number of times during the day if needed, previous Priority/High Priority items still pending or not. However, ALL Priority and High Priority tasks must be done by the end of the day.<br><br>III. Weeding the List<br>1. All items 14 days old are to be marked as "Pre-Priority" items and processed as above.<br><br><br>I call this CAFR (Context Autofocus Revised) because it does all I had hoped for that system but in a much simpler way, and even does more.</div>

<div class="content">@learning RE pinball machines - <br><br>I always found that if I tried to keep all seven balls in play (or whatever number they'd throw at you), I'd quickly lose track and they'd all drop through the chute.   Usually I'd end up putting all my focus on the flippers, and just hit the flipper whenever anything came anywhere close.   I thought if I could keep hitting the balls, they'd stay in play long enough to rack up some points just by random chance. <br><br>It didn't work.   They'd all go through the chute.   I'd be so flustered, that by the time there was only 1 or 2 balls left, I couldn't even keep them in play.  I couldn't understand how I could always botch such a great opportunity to rack up points!   LOL<br><br>But if I focused on just ONE ball, I could do pretty well.  I'd completely ignore all the others.  In fact, forcibly trying to ignore all the other balls and just watch ONE ball meant I applied more concentration than when there was only one ball to begin with.   I could keep that one ball in play a very long time, with such focused concentration, and rack up a lot of bonus points and such.   <br><br>But this just didn't make sense to me -- it seemed mathematically wrong.   It seemed to make more mathematical sense that I'd have a high probability of making points, when so many more balls were in play.   My mathematical expectations didn't account for the psychology of attention and focus!   <br><br>Interesting analogy!   I wonder if any scientific research has been done on this!    (Seriously!)   I think I often had the false expectation that keeping many tasks and projects in play would be a better use of opportunities, than focusing on just one at a time, and lately I have found the complete opposite to be true.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>LOL about pin ball.  Actually I was pretty good at it when I was allowed to play one ball at a time.  Sometimes my older brother (who was the neighborhood pinball wizard) would be nice to me even when he was with his buddies. He'd put in a dime and let me play.  When the ball was lasting too long and his buddies started complaining, my brother would fire all the rest of them to get me off the machine quickly!  LOL!  He'd buy me a candy bar and then tell me to "beat it" (50's lingo for "get out of here"  LOL!  He was trying to sound gruff around the guys to cancel out the moment of being "soft" to his baby sister.  It was a great place.  The jukebox was always playing.  I felt like a real big shot when my brother would dance the Lindy with me. He was the only guy in his gang who was nice once in a while to his sisters!  LOL!  Sometimes he played so long on one dime that he'd hand the rest of his game over to somebody else to finish.<br><br>re: one project or more than one?  I think there are too many variables to draw one generalized conclusion.  Sometimes I can hum for hours on end with one project.  Other times, I hit stalemate.  I can then do other things while my brain processes the project in the background.  When my brain is ready, I go back to the main project.  For me, it totally depends on the project, my engagement with it or my problems with it.  I like having something else to do to give my brain some time to think and then get back to it.  If I'm at a temporary stalemate, I don't want to stop doing my all my day's work.  My projects get done in about the same amount of time overall.  Some projects get done quickly.  Others need breaks between sessions.  Again, it all depends on the project.  At least for me, sometimes problem solving, designing, creativity et al sometimes requires intervals of time away from it.  Other times it's pure flow.  I never know ahead of time how it will go if it's something I haven't done before!  LOL!  psssttt....sometimes I have to fail several times before I get it right!

But instead of bouncing between many projects, I have ONE focus project, and then lots of odds and ends and smaller tasks that need to be worked on.   I block out focused time for the focus project, and then use the remaining time for meetings, interruptions, clearing email, handling the smaller tasks.    This ensures the main focus work gets done, while the maintenance work and interruptions also get handled.   And it provides the necessary diversions so I don't go crazy just doing one thing all the time.<br><br>Right now I have about 12 hours per week blocked out for my focus project at work.

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>It sounds like you've got a good work rhythm.  I'm thinking that we do have some things in common.  My CI might be similar to your one project.  Also your bundling of recurring tasks might be similar as well.  Since my brain categorizes everything, I think of them as projects.  I don't do Inbox zero, but My category: Computer is fairly easy.  First I check all updates.  I've learned the hard way not to trust automatic updates!  LOL!  Evernote seems to regard premium users as the beta users!  I don't want to fart around with bugs.  Firefox can sometimes be sloppy like that also.  I also manually check my apps and plugins and extensions except NoScript (although it can be a pain in the arse learning the updates.) I predict that eventually Noscript will offer a blank page!  LOL!  Then I check my emails.  After I check and dump the spam, I check what's in.  If it's not particularly urgent, I'll just start my MITs.  <br>I have some one offs for MITs but usually it's bundled into a category with fake deadlines.  IOW, it will stay current but not done everyday.  I didn't like that unnecessary burden.  LOL!  <br>I try to fit my MITs into 2-4 hours.  That leaves me several hours to choose what I want to do.  The MITs are usually to remind me what I want to be current on or get ahead.  The extra time can be used to get ahead overall, focus on a project or........quit for the day!  LOL!<br>Confession: I don't usually spend 12 hours on my CI unless I lucked out with a project that's engaging.  Even if it's frustrating, I keep to it since I've given it CI status!  LOL!  I usually save that spot to make sure I get something done well before the deadline.  I have plenty of time to work on other projects.  I love having the crappola jobs behind me before I get involved with certain projects.  In case I'm really enjoying it, I like having a free mind to latch onto it for as long as I feel like!  LOL!

I'm sure that forgetting about your 1,000+ task list must feel like such a relief.  I have the same tendency.  Each quarter, I cull all my great ideas and loosely schedule the actually important ones for another .....season!  LOL!  Confession: Lots of those ideas are either pie in the sky (like I'm going to live to be a thousand years old) and some are, frankly, just plain hare-brained nonsense!  LOL!  I like to keep them for a season and then look back.  Once in a blue moon, an embarrassingly stupid, far-fetched idea can be the germination of a future great idea.  LOL!  Yup, my brain doesn't turn off often enough.  And I can't blame all the silly ideas on meds.  Sometimes my tangential thoughts from the stupid thoughts are actually good!  LOL!

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br>It seems to me that if I were only allowed to work on tasks in the Focus list, that would encourage growth of that list, since I might be tempted to add Could/Should/Might tasks to the list so they're "available" to select.  I consider the length of the Focus list to be a critical factor, and I'm leery of anything that would encourage a longer Focus list, since that would defeat the purpose of it.<br><br>That being said, I hear you about tasks from the Main list serving as possible distractions from the Focus list, but I don't think that adding a rule to only work on the Focus list would help, since it's always possible to ignore the rules or stop using the system.  But I do think that putting such a distraction onto the Focus list would likely be a mistake, unless it's truly something that you want to drive to completion.  Even if that's the case, if you already have your "Top 3" filled up, at least pick of them to replace so you're not extending the Focus list further.  Three extra tasks seems sufficient, don't you think?<br><br>As for the 7+/-2 thing, I searched and apparently it's "one of the most highly cited papers in psychology", way back in 1956:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two</a><br><br>I'm sure that's the reference I had heard about.  Interestingly, in searching for the reference above, I found mention of a 2008 study suggesting the real limit is FOUR!<br><br><a href="http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/04/the-limits-of-m.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/04/the-limits-of-m.html</a><br><a href="http://www.livescience.com/2493-mind-limit-4.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.livescience.com/2493-mind-limit-4.html</a><br><br>So whether the limit is 7+/-2 (i.e. 5-9) or only 4, either way it seems preferable to try to keep the Focus list in the single digits, and 4 or fewer might be ideal.  I don't see anything wrong with an empty Focus list; then you're effectively using something closer to stock AF1.  The Focus list is intended to keep a few things "on the radar", not to dictate what you work on.<br><br>Part of the question in my mind is how routine daily tasks are best handled.  Including them in the Focus list makes that list longer, but they might get lost on the Main list.  Adding a third Daily list (checklist) might be a reasonable option, or just scheduling the time outside the system.  Thoughts?</div>

The first is for UNrelated items and in my case it is 3.The second is for INTERrelated items and in my case it is 8 (header + 7 subitems).<br>When chunking a bigger entity, if I chunk it based on the numbers above, I feel calm and in control. If the entity grows as they usually do, I chunk it again when there are more than 3 unrelated items or more than 8 interrelated items in a subentity.<br>Thus in the focus list (header: Focus-list) may be up to 7 items. I prefer to have 4-6 items, some of them I work with actively and others are the next ones in queue, usually needing some preliminary work to be done before I begin to work with them with a greater intensity.</div>

<div class="content">+ JMJ +<br><br>@ Deven: "Part of the question in my mind is how routine daily tasks are best handled."<br><br>I like how routine tasks are being done in my system now. I not only mark the MIT's for today (which I include by definition the "routine" tasks, because those tasks actually are very important and maintaining yourself and your systems), but also which of those I should be doing in the next few hours.  Therefore even if I have a lot of MIT for today even including my routine tasks, I have usually only five or six at the most I have to focus on at a time, including the routine tasks I have to do in the next few hours.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br>I've never used a "dashboard" system.  You must have me confused with someone else on that one.<br><br>As for developing your system into this, it's funny.  I've been evolving AF2ND (your invention) for quite some time now, but this Focus list idea made me decide to switch to the original AF1 as a base instead, to make AF1NDF1 -- which means I've stopped using your idea of rewriting the oldest task automatically as in AF2ND.  However, I'm still keeping your idea of incremental deletion instead of "dismissal" -- that still feels right to me.  I've also stopped using my own idea of adapting the rules for prioritized tasks, though I'm still marking some tasks with 1-2 stars for emphasis.  (Officially, prioritization is not part of the AF1NDF1 rules.)<br><br>So far, I'm really liking AF1NDF1 a lot, it seems to work better than anything I've tried before, with much less rewriting than the AF2ND series, while remaining efficient for managing urgent tasks due to keeping a short Focus list.  Also, because it's so simple (much like AF1), I've found myself actually USING the system more consistently, which I've always found difficult in general.<br><br>I still haven't found a way to force myself to do high-resistance tasks, but I don't really think any list processing system can really do that.  Nevertheless, AF1NDF1 has been very effective at keeping such tasks front and center (as intended) and hard to forget, and I have indeed made some "little and often" progress that I might not have otherwise, so I guess the jury's still out on this one.<br><br>So far, AF1NDF1 is doing an excellent job of staying on top of urgent tasks thanks to the Focus list.  So far, so good.  We'll see where it stands in a month, though! :)<br><br>As for your CAFR system, it's an interesting idea.  Certainly there's a lot to be said for doing some pre-planning, since intentions matter and may help with high-resistance tasks in particular.  (I need to give this point more thought...)  Personally, I like stars better than arrows for marking prioritized tasks, but maybe that's just because they're more fun to draw! :)<br><br>It seems like saying "ALL Priority and High Priority tasks must be done by the end of the day" may end up being wishful thinking, and for myself, I completely disagree with your method for weeding the list.  Just because a task is over 14 days old doesn't mean that I want it prioritized.  I have dozens of ancient tasks on my list that months old -- some even years old.  Would it be good to have them done in a more timely fashion?  Sure, but not at the expense of other tasks that are more important to be doing now.  Are they irrelevant for being old?  No.  Maybe that system works for you, but I'll stick with your incremental deletion strategy from AF2ND, thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Learning as I go:<br><br>You're right, I wasn't very clear in the way I wrote that.  My previous attempts (Prioritized FV and the entire AF2NDP series) involved keeping a single list and marking prioritized tasks with one or more stars, then having the rules apply in certain ways based on the number of stars on a task.<br><br>AF1NDF1, on the other hand, only uses the Focus list.  As you correctly point out, this is a prioritization mechanism, but a different approach.  What I meant was that prioritization by adding stars to a task isn't part of the official rules -- only the Focus list is.  I still use 1-2 stars to highlight tasks of interest, but that's more as a visual indicator of importance.  Unlike the AF2NDP systems, the processing doesn't change at all when I add or remove stars with AF1NDF1, save that the starred tasks might be more likely to "stand out" perhaps.<br><br>I've long been a proponent of prioritization, but you're right -- it seem to be generally frowned upon, perhaps because Mark has stated that his attempts to add prioritization never seem to work right, or something to that effect.<br><br>While I agree that the Focus list does prioritize some tasks above all others, note there is a significant difference between a short Focus list and allowing unlimited numbers of priority tasks at unlimited priority levels, as I previously did.  With the AF2NDP series, I sometimes had as many as 5 stars on some tasks, which involved a lot of rewriting.  Now, I don't feel the need to add more than 2 stars to any task, and it's not required at all.  The Focus list still does its job quite well without stars on any tasks.</div>

(I've debated whether I should be tracking the original date when rewriting a task, but current I don't.)  Since I'm using one line per task (unless more are needed), I can fit up to 10 tasks on a single index card, and I've found there's some added motivation from wanting to finish the card once most of it is crossed out.

<div class="content">Hi Deven<br>I think that although our methodologies aren't identical, we do seem to share many principles that govern our systems.  I have weekly and daily MIT's and you have a focus list.  I use relief tasks to keep me working despite needing a break from a high resistance MIT and you alternate between the focus list and the general list.<br><br>My MITs are like your starred tasks/jobs.  I rarely have work that MUST be done today.  Sometimes I do use stars on an MIT to signify that the job is both important and is loaded with resistance!  LOL!  It both guides my task selection and gives me incentive to get the damn thing done.  The day will be much nicer once it's off the MIT list.  LOL!  I also use stars on my grocery list for the items I must not forget.  LOL!  (I like to keep my regularly used items always stocked with a backup). I also like to buy meat and produce fresh.  If I don't star some things, my meals won't be balanced.  LOL!  To be sure, I also like to make sure that I have the ingredients to make my sweets.  (I love all food except fruits.  I have to use determination to eat fruit.)<br>Because I have a terrible short term memory, I also keep a chart of when I bought the perishables.  I don't want to waste food because my memory failed me.  LOL!  Like you, using stars helps me.  I also use them to highlight appointments and social obligations.<br><br>I'm enjoying reading your notes as you build your system.  Even though I work my system almost identically from day to day, I don't consider any of my guidelines as rules.  When I need to adjust my work pattern or change my focus, I don't want to worry about what a rule tells me to do.  I let my responsibilities and the work itself guide my strategy.</div>

<div class="content">Learning as I go:<br><br>Don't worry too much about the terminology of calling them "rules" -- since nobody is policing you, and the system is for your own benefit, you might well feel free to violate them at will if that works for you.  I could call them "guidelines" instead, but that would seem to encourage breaking them!  While I don't see anything wrong with choosing to break the "rules", and I'll do so myself, the best reason I see for calling them "rules" instead of "guidelines" is as a reminder that breaking them might have consequences.  It's just that the consequences are that you might get different results, not that someone can tell you that you MUST do what the rule says.<br><br>Breaking the rules in a consistent way that leads to an improvement in results is good, and helps inform the process of refining the rules to find what works best.  Breaking the rules in a way that leads to a degradation in results is okay, but you might be missing out.  Perhaps the system would be more effective if you follow the rules -- or perhaps not.  It's always hard to know, isn't it?<br><br>Part of the problem is that one must devise "rules" by speculation and hypothesis, informed by experience and logic...  but until you actually lock them down and try to follow them, you just don't know if they'll work in practice.  Every system worth trying usually sounds good on paper, and needs to be tested.  Following the rules makes the test more valid.  Disregarding them may invalidate the test, but that doesn't make it inherently wrong -- at worst, you've invented your own variant without formalizing it!</div>

<div class="content">Deven, I agree, same-day goals go on the Focus list for the day. That way, the rest of your lists can be ignored until tomorrow. (When busy, I do a Focus list for the week. That way, at least early in the week, I can ignore the bulk of the list for several days.) "Not doing this today will break the chain, and, if past experience is anything to go by, put the entire goal at risk" means today's step is as important as the goal.<br><br>Today I'm drawn to an earlier comment of mine. Make the Focus list intentionally optimistic. Optimistic is still realistic. It's similar to (but not exactly the same as) "three non-urgent" things. If I know it's optimistic, I'll be selective when picking from it. When working the f I can't settle down to anything high-priority from the list, I might at least find something else on it, rather than giving up or opening the big list of things I decided not to do. It's also faster for me to make a focus list when I'm a bit looser. If it's borderline, write it down and move on.<br><br>However, that's not the system I want to run this season, and I'm stalling.<br><br>Learning, try running a fridge with a teenage boy and a pre-teen picky eater who insists on her share of all the left-overs, even if she didn't like the meal the first time.

<div class="content">Cricket,<br><br>While the idea isn't to use the Focus list alone and ignore the Main list, if you inevitably choose something from the Focus list, the effect is the same.  After all, you only end up looking at the Main list when nothing on the Focus list "stands out".<br><br>Let's consider this a retroactive update/clarification to the AF1NDF1 rules, since there's no real processing change here to justify assigning a new name.  Same-day goals belong on the Focus list automatically, just like urgent tasks and tasks with hard external deadlines.<br><br>As for making the Focus list optimistic, I take that to mean including more same-day goals than you're confident you can actually accomplish.  I guess this is one approach, but I'm still wary of letting the Focus list grow too long.  If you have 10+ tasks on the Focus list, it starts to seem less focused and maybe an invitation to chaos, but that's just my opinion/speculation.  Perhaps some people could have good results with 20 tasks on a Focus list, but I suspect it's a bit much!<br><br>So, can I convince you to give AF1NDF1 a try?  I could use more feedback! :)</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br>Yes, unexpected events may happen, which is the main reason it seems a little wishful to say that the planned tasks "must" be done by the end of the day.  I could agree with "should", but "must" seems to ignore the reality that sometimes things just won't go as planned, perhaps despite your best efforts.  Perhaps failures to complete the tasks could trigger an evaluation process to determine why?<br><br>On the other point, you say "Traditionally, the tasks placed in systems based off Mark's ideas are meant to at the very least started soon (i.e. Within weeks)."  I'm not sure I agree with this assessment; here's a quote from the AF1 rules: "As you think of new items, add them to the end of the list.  One of the characteristics of this system is that you can chuck anything at it. I recommend that you enter everything that comes to mind without trying to evaluate. The system itself will do the evaluation."  It explicitly says "anything" and "everything" -- not "anything you intend to start soon"...<br><br>On the other hand, I would certainly agree that Mark's dismissal processes are indeed designed to weed older, neglected tasks from the system.  As such, I would expect that tasks would have a hard time surviving a year through the normal dismissal process.  That being said, I don't care for the dismissal process at all, and much prefer incremental deletion as in AF2ND.  Granted, this means old tasks can and do remain on the list indefinitely, but I consider this a feature, not a bug.  Recent tasks are not inherently more valuable than old ones that have survived repeated review, in my mind.<br><br>Does it clutter the system to have years-old tasks in it?  Well, obviously it makes the list longer, but does that translate into clutter?  The dictionary definition of "clutter" says "to fill or cover with scattered or disordered things that impede movement or reduce effectiveness".  So I guess the real question is whether it reduces effectiveness of the system.  If it does, then it may tend to make the system irrelevant, as in your experience.<br><br>What are the options for handling old tasks, in general?  (1) Keep them in the list indefinitely.  (2) Delete/dismiss them from the list, on the assumption that you'll never do them anyway.  (3) Move them to a "Someday/Maybe" list for later consideration.  (4) Try to force yourself to do them.  (Are there any others I've missed?)<br><br>I don't like automatically deleting tasks on the assumption that they'll never be done.  Granted, that assumption may prove correct.  Nevertheless, I would rather make that determination on a case-by-case basis during an incremental review process, not as a consequence of processing rules that automatically treat old tasks as a problem.  I also don't like the "Someday/Maybe" list approach, because I've tried it and found that I just never return to the list at all, in practice.  As for forcing myself to do them, it just doesn't work for me -- the more a system relies on compulsion, the more resistance I feel toward the system itself.<br><br>Hence, I'm left with keeping the old tasks on the list as the only viable option for me.  That means I need a system that can deal with an arbitrarily long list effectively, and not get cluttered up by old tasks that do need to remain on the list.  This is why I've put so much effort into trying to find or devise a system that works to meet my needs... if AF1NDF1 doesn't fit the bill, I'll try yet again!<br><br>I do believe that stock AF1 gets cluttered by old tasks easily, but I'm not sure that the old tasks really affect AF1NDF1's effectiveness very much, because the Focus list keeps the most relevant tasks up-front, and the others are reviewed at a more leisurely pace.  Also, the old tasks are less likely to "stand out" (which is why they're old!) and therefore will tend to be skipped over relatively quickly.<br><br>Certainly, if you have any ideas for a better solution that doesn't involve removing the old tasks from the list, I'm very interested to hear them.<br><br>As for your point that 14-day-old tasks just become "Pre-Priority" tasks, that doesn't change the assumption implicit in your 14-day rule: that everything SHOULD be done within two weeks.  After all, "What SHOULD I be doing this day?" is your question for determining "Pre-Priority" tasks in the first place.  I don't want a rule dictating that I SHOULD be working on a task just because it's been 2 weeks since I thought of it.  Sure, I can choose not to keep it on the Priority list, but it still becomes an explicit decision to be made on each old task on a daily basis, which certainly suggests to me that older tasks will inherently clutter CAFR because of the 14-day rule.  But if it works for you, more power to you!</div>

If that shows some immediate value, then fine, I can keep it on my task list -- and now I have a concrete action to take.    But if the only next action I can think of, is something like "maybe this will help with NNN project", then I can file it with that project and evaluate it in that context.    And sometimes I realize the next action is "install this and try it out and compare it to the tools you are already using", and I just don't want to take the time to do that, then I can just finally delete it and get rid of it.    This whole thought process takes 1-2 minutes per item and weeds down my lists substantially.<br><br>The key insight for me is that 80% of those magazine articles fall into that last category -- yes, there might be something worth exploring, but the value isn't worth the work, so I may as well toss the whole stack, and focus on FRESH and CURRENT opportunities instead.</div>

<div class="content">What works well for me with physical stuff I'm not sure I need, is to 'quarantine' it apart from the everyday stuff.<br><br>Then after a time or after I've collected so much, I go through and say halve it, by retaining the most useful valuable stuff and letting go of the rest.<br><br>The basis for this is that it's MUCH easier - for me anyway :-) - to make relative decisions than absolute decisions, so much easier to decide 'This is more valuable/useful than that' than decide 'Do I need this or not?'<br><br>Maybe the same approach can be used where there's a large number of hibernated tasks or project ideas.</div>

<div class="content">I just discovered something really helpful that might be relevant to this discussion. I determined how many tasks I enter and then complete on an average day. After factoring in the fact that I do lots of work by routine that isn't added as a task into my system, the number I came up with for tasks I can complete daily is 6. The way it is, I've been entering one more task per day than I was getting done. No wonder I get buried!<br><br>In order to limit myself to 6, I'm going to have to start putting all the ideas I have in another system. I have an idea journal (an idea I got from Barbara Sher's Refuse to Choose), but I'm thinking of putting a lot of stuff into Evernote. Then I can make perusing my physical or virtual notebook part of my routine. <br><br>Seraphim, I used to keep magazines because I swore I was going to cut out every recipe I liked in them and create a recipe book from it. So glad I finally recycled them because now I always search for recipes online. :-) You're on the right track!

<div class="content">Cricket's hibernation idea seems to be working well for me.  I've decided that it's not worth the complexity of multiple hibernation lists for different target months because I generally wanted "next month" for almost everything.  (After all, they're generally things I'd like to be done, but just don't realistically expect to get to soon.)<br><br>So the solution I'm using is to go through the hibernation process monthly, and I'm using a reminder in my tickler file for the first of the next month so I don't forget.  The monthly hibernation process then consists of reviewing the Main list and the Hibernate lists and moving tasks between them as appropriate.  (There is no need to review the Focus list.)  For each task, I ask myself "Am I likely to work on this task this month?" to decide which tasks should be active.  (Note that "likely" is the key concept here to avoid keeping too many tasks active.)<br><br>In practice, this worked exactly as intended yesterday -- I went through the process because I was reminded by the tickler file, and found a few new tasks to hibernate AND a few tasks on the Hibernate list to reactivate as well.  I think this particular approach will help avoid the "graveyard effect" of my old Someday/Maybe list with GTD.<br><br>My next post will officially incorporate this idea into my evolving system, along with the tickler file.</div>

<div class="content">This post defines AF1NDF2, which adds a tickler file and hibernation process to AF1NDF1.<br><br>Here are the full rules:<br><br>* Keep four separate lists: a Main list, containing anything (universal capture); a short Focus list (preferably with fewer than 10 tasks -- or perhaps none!), containing only urgent tasks, current-day goals, tasks with hard deadlines and up to 3 other tasks which would otherwise belong on the Main list (allowing for a "Top 3" or "Current Initiative"); a Future list (i.e. tickler file), containing dated tasks to be activated on specific future dates; and a Hibernate list, containing inactive tasks which you are not likely to work on soon (i.e. Someday/Maybe tasks).<br><br>* Add new tasks to the end of the appropriate list (usually the Main list by default).<br><br>* Move tasks between lists at will, subject to the intended purpose of each list.<br><br>* Tasks may be starred to indicate importance, but this does not affect the processing rules.<br><br>* Tasks may also be dated to record when the task was added to the system.  (In this case, retaining the original date is recommended when rewriting the task, except for recurring tasks.)<br><br>* Tasks may be followed on the following line(s), with arrow indicators, by one or more specific actions (such as a GTD-style "next action") if desired  (This is most likely to be helpful when the "task" is actually a larger project.)<br><br>* Page size does not matter.  (For example, this system works well with 3x5 index cards, which can fit up to 10 tasks/card.)<br><br>* Pages should be dated and labeled with the appropriate list name.  (Dedicating each page to a single list is recommended.)<br><br>* At the start of each day, review the Future list and rewrite all ready tasks (where the date of the task has arrived) on the Focus list.  For recurring tasks (e.g. weekly or monthly), also rewrite the task on the Future list with the next recurring date.<br><br>* Keep a monthly recurring Hibernation task on the Future list as a reminder to process the Hibernate list regularly.  For this Hibernation task, at the start of each month, review both the Main list and the Hibernate list, moving tasks between the lists as appropriate, based on whether or not you are LIKELY to select the task for action this month -- whether or not you want to, or hope to.  (Optionally, a different interval may be used, such as a 2-3 week "sprint" instead of monthly.)<br><br>* To select a task to work on, always start at the beginning of the Focus list and consider each task in turn until a task "stands out". (Tasks which are no longer relevant should be deleted from the list as they are considered.)<br><br>* If no task on the Focus list "stands out", switch to the Main list and continue to consider each task until you find a task that "stands out".  Ideally, this scan should resume after the last task previously considered on the Main list, but returning to the start of that page is acceptable.<br><br>* If no task on the Main list "stands out" either, you may choose to continue with the Hibernate list next.  (This is optional.)<br><br>* If no task "stands out" on any list considered, then select the highest-resistance actionable task from the Focus list (or Main list if necessary) for action instead.<br><br>* Work on the selected task for as long as you feel like doing so.  (At a minimum, "get out the folder".)<br><br>* Cross the task off the list, and rewrite it at the end of the appropriate list (usually the same list) if you haven’t finished it.<br><br>* Return to the start of the Focus list and repeat the procedure above to select the next task.</div>

<div class="content">Based on Cricket's clothing example, I thought the idea of a Hibernation list was this:<br>(1) Take all the stuff you haven't touched in awhile, and put it on your Hibernation list.<br>(2) Determine how long you want the list to Hibernate (let's say 3 months).   Hide away your list for that duration of time.<br>(3) If you recall there's something on that list you want to do, or you have some extra time and want to go look - then go ahead and crack open the list, reactivating whatever you want to reactivate.  Put the rest back into a new hibernation period.<br>(4) If you don't open the list during the hibernation period, then you throw away the list without looking at it.  <br>(5) The reason you don't look at it is to avoid the nostalgic feeling of "Oh yeah, that was a great idea, I should maybe pursue that," and overfilling your current list of tasks.  <br><br>The main thing I like about this:   it has helped me overcome the fear of outright deletion.   It's much easier just to admit "This might be a great idea, but I'm never going to do it because all my time is taken up pursuing things that are even better!" and delete it immediately.    It is very freeing, and allows me to focus on current opportunities rather than managing a catalog of old, stale opportunities.</div>

<div class="content">Deven's experience matches mine about wanting "next month" for almost everything.<br><br>I don't have a set time to look at my hibernation list, but if I did, 3-6 months sounds good.<br><br>Absolutely don't look at the hibernation list more often than necessary. It's too tempting to reactivate things, and too sad to see all of those projects lying neglected.<br><br>The only reasons I can think of for reviewing the hibernation list are you have time to reactivate something, or you're worried about missing a deadline.<br><br>If you truly have time to reactivate a project and do it right, rather than just filling in a few moments that you could also fill with an active project, then yes, pick one from the list or elsewhere.<br><br>I sometimes plan when I'm going to reactivate a project. It goes in the same column as an active project. It's a carrot for finishing (or otherwise closing) the first one. It's not an excuse to flip between projects.<br><br>Even a project that seems like it can fit in your spare moments, can't. They lie. It will take up brain space and encourage you to do just one bit more -- at the expense of your other commitments and your sanity. (Not that this is easy to remember. A project is yelling at me pretty hard right now, and typing this is helping me remember why I can't reactivate it.)<br><br>As for missing a deadline for a hibernating project, look at your future commitments. Can you fit it in? If not, make the hard decision. If you can, then double-check there's nothing else on the hibernating list that entices you more, then fill in your milestone chart (or equivalent) and calendar as if you committed -- but in pencil. Include time to prepare for the deadline.<br><br>For example, you've wanted to take a course at the local school for several years, but never gotten around to it. Registration deadline is November, and the class starts in January. Plenty of time, and certainly not an active project -- therefore hibernating.<br><br>I'll turn to the back of my planner and book the study time and class time now, and time to prepare the application package. In pencil. "4 hours studying per week" is enough detail at that distance. If a friend asks me tomorrow to commit to something in March, looking at my plan tells me I need to make a decision.<br><br>(Be pessimistic for future dates, especially for real commitments. You never know what might turn up between now and then.)<br><br>This is much scarier than saying, "If I have time," and, just like last year, not having the time and wondering why you never get around to taking it.<br><br>It also means you don't have to reopen all the wounds caused by putting things into hibernation on a regular basis.<br><br>If the project is truly the right one for you, you won't forget it, even if you toss the hibernation list entirely.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps I've twisted Cricket's idea a bit; I'm using it as more of an "Inactive" list than a true long-term hibernation list. Perhaps a retroactive renaming may be in order.  I'm also starting to wonder if a weekly review would be better than my initial idea of monthly, which would be even less like what Cricket is actually doing. :)</div>

<div class="content">I can call mine long-term hibernation. That's how I use it. Things I want to get to sometime, but probably won't do in the current time-unit, well, to be honest they're on the uncompleted lists from previous weeks, which I review weekly or even daily. Not elegant, but it works.</div>

<div class="content">Hibernation implies long-term to me.  Therefore, let's consider the Hibernate list in AF1NDF2 to be retroactively renamed to Pending, which is a more accurate description.  That way, if someone wants to add long-term hibernation, they can call it a Hibernate list without conflict.<br><br>Also, I'm changing the recommendation to a weekly review of the Pending list, rather than monthly.  I realized that I have a better handle on "this week" than "this month", but it still keeps the pending tasks out of sight most of the time.<br><br>Interestingly, now that I've switched to a weekly horizon, I now have 69 Pending tasks, 3 Main tasks and 5 Focus tasks for my Work system.  This means that 90% of my list is "out of sight, out of mind" and not distracting me from the few things that I'm likely to actually work on this week.  So far, so good!<br><br>For my Home system, I currently have 6 Main tasks and 10 Focus tasks and dozens of Pending tasks.  I can't check the exact count right now because I keep the list of Pending tasks at home.  (The other lists are on index cards in my pocket.)</div>

<div class="content">I you count my old lists as Pending, then yes, a weekly review is about right for me. I keep coming home to a full review of all outstanding (but not hibernating) tasks every week, with the option to read them again when nothing on the current list stands out.<br><br>(My old lists consist of things I'd hoped to do when planning, and things that I thought of but didn't expect to do immediately. I write those at the bottom of today's list even if I don't expect to do them. That way they're in the system.)<br><br>69 pending? That's a lot.<br><br>This week l'm excited about focusing on one project until it's done. "Just do a bit" doesn't build excitement. "Yeah, I'll do a bit, big deal," vs "Finally get this monkey off my back." Have to be careful, though, since too far the other way leads to burnout and not getting more urgent things done. I picked one of my slow-and-steady projects. The rest are still pending, but might move to hibernation, since they don't have firm deadlines and I want to get the current one done before activating them.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, it sounds like your list of outstanding tasks is functionally equivalent to my Pending list (called the Hibernate list in the rules post), and it seems we're in agreement that weekly is a good frequency for review.<br><br>As for the size of the list, I'd rather have those 69 tasks on my Pending list, reviewed once a week, rather than on my Main list (where they previously were).  Most of them are older, of course (some even years old), but they're still at least somewhat relevant.  But generally they lack hard deadlines.  I want to pare them down, of course...</div>
