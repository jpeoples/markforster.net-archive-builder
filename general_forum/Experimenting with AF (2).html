<div class="content">Another experiment I have tried with AF does seem to be working a lot better than my first experiment. :-)<br><br>In the earlier days of Beta Testing the suggestion was made of writing "urgent" items on an index card and using that alongsde each current page, so that those tasks could also be picked.  I did not personally get on with that suggestion but found that the act of writing those items down on another piece of paper did seem to alleviate the concern, even though I didn't actually end up doing anything with the list.<br><br>What I have tried, instead of writing those items down in a list, is to write them down as a mindmap.  As those items have the effect of trying to tell me when they need to be done by, they carry a fair degree of resistance.  By doing a mindmap - and making that mindmap "fun", with pictures and notations, just looking at the list makes me smile.  Actually it would make anyone smile if they saw my attempts at drawing.  :-)<br><br>I am quite happy having that mindmap where I can see it because it is "fun", it is more creative, and it is not a threat.  The items have just lost their resistance!  Whether I use that alongside my AF in the form of an index card I have yet to decide - at present I am just seeing what happens - so far I have done some of the items but as I reached them on my lists.  I know the deadlines so want to see if they do get cleared "naturally" within my lists but at the very least the act of producing that mindmap "index card" has reduced my anxiety over those specific items.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this idea, Christine! I think I will try it! I *have* been using the "index card" idea for about the past week (part of my "timeblocking" experiment) but it has seemed more like a rigid "get-this-done!" list lacking in the more free-flowing experience I had previously been enjoying from AF. Using a colourful mindmap sounds good!</div>

<div class="content">I use the "magical index card" to make sure time-specific things get done. At first it felt odd, but I soon got used to it, because this way, I don't have to worry anymore: In the morning, I look in my calendar and jot down whatever there is as task that absolutely has to be done that day or week. Usually there are only one or two items for a day, maybe five for a week (I am very nitpicking now about what is REALLY a time-dependend task: "I planned to get this done until Friday" is no longer a valable argument. Time-dependend is only what has real (and bad) consequences should I miss it!), and that's it. I try to make it in a way so I can work only from my AF list. (There are days when this is not possible, however. Today, for example.)<br><br>The "magical index card" is my bookmark for the active page as well, by the way. And I draw a line between "today" and "this week" duties. That works for me.<br><br>Let's face it: Sometimes there ARE things you just HAVE to get done. We know it, and so our intuition can deal with that, too.<br><br>And following the perfect TM system and forgetting important duties don't get together... ;-)</div>

<div class="content">If I am faced with a batch of "must do today" items, I add them to the end of the list, write "MUST TO TODAY" at the end of the item, and then switch to that page.   Then cycle through the page as normal.  The urgency of the items is usually enough to make them "stand out".<br><br>Doing this frequently may have the effect of neglecting the earlier or middle pages.  But I haven't found it to be a problem at all.</div>

<div class="content">I've been making a "will do" list for the day and then autofocusing that list.  When there are no more items that "stand out" on the list I switch to my big master-list and autofocus there -- doing a maximum of three items.<br>Then I return to my "will do" list for the day and repeat the whole process.<br>So far it seems to be working quite nicely.</div>
