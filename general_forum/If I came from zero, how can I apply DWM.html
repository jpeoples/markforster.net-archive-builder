<div class="content">Here's how I'm doing it - <br>Get a notebook with dated pages or date the pages yourself <br>Write new tasks on March 5 (one month from day)<br>When I work on one of the tasks, I cross it off March 5.<br>If it's not finished when I'm done working on it (little&often), I write it on Feb 12 (one week from day)<br>Tomorrow, new tasks go on March 6, worked on but not finished tasks go on Feb 13. I have tasks to pick from on 4 pages - Feb 12, 13 and March 5, 6. <br>On Feb 12 (probably at the end of the day, I haven't decided) whatever's not crossed-off is  dismissed. <br><br>You only work on pages dated between today and "today + 30" Pages before today are dismissed and pages greater than "today +30" are blank. <br><br>Or you can do the same set up electronically.</div>

<div class="content">Not an expert, but I think you would re-enter the task again, seven days on from the day you worked on it, eg if worked on it on Feb 5, re-enter Feb 12, then work again on Feb 7, re-enter on Feb 14, and so on. <br><br>Each time you work on a task, you have seven more days to come back to it before it will expire.<br><br>Someone jump in, if I am wrong!</div>

<div class="content">There is no Feb 29 this year, so Mon Mar 1.  Tomorrow you work on it and then rewrite on Tues Mar 2.  So you always have a 7 day window to get back to your active tasks.</div>

<div class="content">This kind of makes sense to me, but how do you handle tickler items?  For example, I have treatment plan assessments I have to do every three months.  So if I updated a treatment plan today then I have to update it and write an assessment in June.  Would I put it on my list 4 months  out or would I put it on the list in June or do I need a separate list of tasks that need to be added to the list later?  Adding it thirty days out from June - i.e. July seems intuitively like the  right thing.  <br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">@ Troy<br><br>I would put it in the tickler file for the date you require and i have a rolling item in DWM that says "check ticker file" which I do every day, I then reenter it 7 days+ and i do always do it, it seems to work as a stand out item, you could of course add it on each day for comfort until you feel like it has become a habit.</div>
