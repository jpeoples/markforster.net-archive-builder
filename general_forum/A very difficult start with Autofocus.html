<div class="content">Today was my first day starting Autofocus at work. Unfortunately, it was also my first day back at work after a five working days' break. Coming to an email inbox containing 220 emails was really not the most opportune time to start using Autofocus. On top of that I had to face spending time to resolve a few problems that could not be put aside.<br><br>What I found especially time consuming was to try and create my Autofocus list while also creating a new email folders structure that would reflect my Autofocus tasks. I wanted to do this so as to try and make a clean break from my previous system which was based on the GTD methodology. The next few days are going to be quite difficult, but I'll persevere. My inbox will hopefully become empty and my Autofocus list will become full of entries to be dealt with.</div>

<div class="content">Otto Fox - FYI, I have not made any change to email folders. For me anyway, a new structure was not necessary.  The list itself was all I needed.  I would encourage you to keep your implementation as simple as possible in the beginning.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Otto<br><br>Don't panic about backlogs - AF does handle them!  Write "check email" as a task and action it when it stands out. Stop when you've had enough and readd the task to the end of the list.  Email was always a particular problem for me and I have cleared massive backlogs with AF - and without resistance.  The temptation after a break is the "I'll just get this done and then I'll ....." method - it doesn't work! AF does!  There are some good tips about email on the forum but I'd recommend just adding a task "look at email system" and let AF itself enable you to identify what will work best for you.  I have simplified my system and any emails that require action are written on my list and temporarily filed in a folder called ....AutoFocus!</div>

<div class="content">Otto:<br><br>My advice is not to try to create a AF list at all. Just start off with a few items and then add things as they come to mind or come up. You'll soon find that everything that is relevant is on your list.<br><br>As for backlogs, when you come back from holiday to an in-box full of email it is useful to have two separate items: "Email Backlog" and "New Email". Once you have cleared the backlog, you can go down to the one item "Email".</div>
