<div class="content">I was recommended by someone to read "Do it Tomorrow".<br>I did, and wow!<br>There are very few books that I can say this about, but the book made a huge impact on my life. I felt like Mark was writing directly to me. I loved the psychological thinking too- particularly the two parts of my brain which don't seem to like talking to each other! This book really can be a life changing book and I've been doing my best to recommend it to all my friends and across my social networks. I might even include it in an up and coming blog post! :-)<br><br>There is no question that I need to read the book again, in fact probably 3 or 4 times. Perhaps I could make this my current initiative!<br><br>I could really do with some tips on how to make these changes into a habit. I've been so used to years of randomness and lack of focus. What is the best way to fix all my defective systems and backlogs. Is it best to book off 2 or 3 days to sort this out?<br><br>So,  I've read the book, and let's say I've put the above into practice! But what now? I've come to this blog, but I am confused. What is all this Final Version stuff about? I feel like I've arrived at the end of the party! Should I read the intro on the archive? Then what? <br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Ian</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ian,<br><br>you can find link to Final Version instructions from the homepage (<a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com)</a> --> click on View the newsletter archive<br><br>I would recommend you to consider this forum a cookbook with various tips and recipes. You do not have to cook all the dishes at once. You are not obliged to try each of them. Just try to experiment sometimes, when you are hungry. But most important: focus on preparing food which you will personally like = choose methods which will work especially for you, as everyone is different and lives in different (inner and outer) conditions. Also, I personally recommend the other Mark`s book "Get everything done"...<br><br>Many people here use Do it tomorrow methodology, many use Autofocus, many Final version - it is up to you and what suits you. You do not have to combine all the recipes into one - I would not expect anything delicious from this...</div>

<div class="content">Ian, I love Do It Tomorrow, too. Here's a post I wrote about my use of it the second time around: <a href="http://www.psychowith6.com/can-mark-forsters-do-it-tomorrow-help-you-get-more-done/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychowith6.com/can-mark-forsters-do-it-tomorrow-help-you-get-more-done/</a><br><br>I think your beginning steps are:<br>1) Declare a backlog and make it your current initiative<br>2) Start listing tasks that come in today to work on tomorrow<br><br>Beyond that, my suggestions are to: a) Limit your list to must-do tasks at first, until you get a sense of what more you can handle b) Make liberal use of little and often; if you do anything on a task and don't want to do more, mark it off and add it to tomorrow's list. c) If you find yourself frequently having 3 days in a row of unfinished tasks, don't scrap the method, assuming you've failed. You may have to eliminate some commitments, or you may just need to tweak something. <br><br>Best wishes!</div>

<div class="content">Welcome, Ian!<br><br>DIT is a great place to start. Follow it to the letter for a month or two, before branching out. Long enough that you begin to feel relief rather than heart-wrench from the project purging step. (Not sure what it's called.) Then start branching out.<br><br>I second Mel. Limit your list to the must-dos. It's all too easy, when you start making progress, to think you might really have time to get everything done and add more. The time to reactivate an optional project is after your backlog of important projects is clear. I speak from repeated experience. Clearing that backlog (which may include dropping projects) will give you more freedom than squeezing in new things.<br><br>I treat the other methods here as ways to make working the list interesting.</div>
