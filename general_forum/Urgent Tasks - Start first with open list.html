<div class="content">Hello,<br><br>Mark: <br>thanks for providing AF4. After the 3rd day it works very well for me at home and at work. Especially since the demo from Andreas I finally understood the system.<br>I use it as described in your instructions without any tweaks - and this is nontypical for me... (with AF1toRAF I started after the first loop through my tasks with thinking about improvements ;-)<br>---<br>Question:<br>After the 3rd day there's only one thing which comes in mind:<br>Mark, you mentioned somewhere that on the next day we should continue where we stopped the day before...<br><br>Wouldn't it be better to start first with the "open list", go through list and then to the task where we stopped the day before? IMO it's much more probable that the most of the urgent task are in the "open list" (more current) and not in the "closed list"</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jens,<br><br>I have a lot of urgent work, but I would suggest not doing so and following Mark's instructions.  I see it a lot like the current inititiative in DIT -- do some of your important, backlog work first, then deal with urgent stuff later.  I know this sounds silly, but I am finding it to work well.  If there is something truly urgent and important, you will find yourself gravitating to that very quickly anyway.<br><br>Another thing I do is to put tasks that absolutely have to be done today in another list in Outlook and/or as an entry on my calendar.  Depending on the importance of the urgent matter, I may work on that straight off before my AF list.  But most times....at least for me...I am finding that I can work AF4 according to Mark's instructions.  We will see how this works over the long period, but for now, it is working well for me.<br><br>-David</div>
