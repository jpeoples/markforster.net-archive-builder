<div class="content">"The two main disadvantages are that people are often reluctant to carry out a proper diagnosis when they fall behind. This considerably reduces the effectiveness of the system if it is constantly running behind.

<div class="content">I assume Michael B has re-posted these in order to see if any ideas have arisen over the last 4 years which might help with the issues identified.<br><br>As I see it there are three issues:<br><br>1) How to deal with getting behind.<br><br>2) How to keep one's commitments pruned so that one doesn't get behind in the first place.<br><br>3) How to deal with the daily list in the most efficient manner.<br><br>These are obviously all closely related. Let's deal with them one by one:<br><br>1) Getting behind<br><br>If we take five days as the maximum we can be behind, it's important first of all to understand what this means. It doesn't mean that tasks which haven't been dealt with for five days go "over the waterfall". This is a common misunderstanding. What it means is something quite different - if one spends longer than five days without having completely caught up then the *whole list* is called into question.<br><br>The simplest way to achieve this is that if at the end of the fifth day of being behind there are any tasks remaining they should all be deleted. What one will then be left with is the next day's list only.<br><br>2) Pruning commitments<br><br>If the mass deletion is adhered to strictly this should in itself be sufficient to encourage people to keep their commitments pruned, simply to avoid the same thing happening over and over again. <br><br>3) Dealing with the daily list<br><br>As I say in the book, if you finish the list it doesn't matter what order the tasks were done in.<br><br>But the order of tasks does matter if you don't finish the list. It also matters if doing it a certain way encourages more resistance.<br><br>The natural tendency for most people is to do the easiest tasks first. The problem with this is that if you don't finish the list, it's the most difficult (and probably the most important) tasks that are going to be left undone.<br><br>So it's better to tackle the list in a different way. Some possible methods:<br><br>- Most difficult tasks first<br><br>- In the order they are written (this will disadvantage "same day urgent" tasks that are added during the day).<br><br>- Use a randomizer. If any tasks are left over they will have random importance and difficulty.<br><br>- Use a more sophisticated method like halving. This would probably be my favourite. You pick your first task about half way down the list. Then the next one about half way between the beginning and the task you've just done, and then the next about half way between the first task and the end. Continue this way, doing one task in each of the gaps between completed tasks on each pass.<br><br>The final question is whether you should deal with any uncompleted days separately, or regard all current days as one list. I would tend to favour the latter. Any ideas on this?</div>

<div class="content">One additional remark:<br><br>It's important to remember that when you start "Do It Tomorrow" for the first time all your existing work goes into a Backlog. Your first day's list therefore should consist only of one item - Backlog. You might want to subdivide this a bit, e.g. Task Backlog, Paper Backlog, Email Backlog. <br><br>These backlogs will be worked at day by day until they are cleared. It's highly recommended that your Current Initiative is a Backlog until they are all cleared. Remember that nothing can be added to a backlog once it has been declared to be a backlog and has been separated from the new work coming in.</div>

<div class="content">This is a great discussion.  DIT is at the core of how I am managing my work these days, so I am very glad to see discussion on this kind of thing!<br><br>On these two topics:<br>- How to deal with getting behind.<br>- How to keep one's commitments pruned so that one doesn't get behind in the first place.<br><br>I've found some things that have helped me quite a bit.<br><br>(1) Added some structure to the Will Do list.   I've broken it into four main sections:  Start, Business of the Day, Wrapup, and Evenings.   <br>- "Start" includes reviewing the calendar for the day, making sure I'm prepared for coming meetings, and working on my current initiative.<br>- "Business of the Day" includes meetings interspersed with working my Task Diary.<br>- "Wrap-up" is scheduled on my calendar for the last hour or so of the day (may be moved, or even skipped, depending on meetings).   This is mainly clearing my inboxes.<br>- "Evening" is a list of reminders of daily things to do with/for the family in the evening<br><br>I aim to complete the list every day.  But if I don't/can't, the daily record of checklists serves as a diagnostic tool.   I can look for patterns.   <br><br>Example:  If I never work on my current initiative, then maybe I have too many meetings at the beginning of the day; what can I do to fix it?   Get to work earlier?  Try to spend more time on days when I DON'T have meetings first-thing?   <br><br>Another example:  Can't clear all my emails - maybe I need to start my "wrap up" time earlier.<br><br>This helps me make minor in-flight adjustments to my routine and helps prevent the need for a full-blown "audit of commitments".<br><br>(2) Also, reviewing the checklists accomplishes a lot of the same things as what a full-blown Time Diary does, but it's much simpler, much less overhead, and directs my attention to the broad categories of time that need adjustment, rather than the minutiae of individual tasks.<br><br>(3) Every Monday, I "dismiss" previous weeks unfinished tasks.   This allows me to start each week "fresh" and only pull forward the things that really demand it.   I then scan those dismissed tasks every few days, and decide whether to re-enter, delete, or move to my "explore" list.<br><br>(4) Taking on just a little bit too much can actually be helpful.  It forces me to prioritize, and helps me get really focused on what's really important, during those few hours of the day when I have time to work on my tasks.   If I have too much open time on my calendar, it's easy to squander it and feel like I have more free time than I really do.<br><br>(5) Keep an "explore" list / "explore" folder.  I mainly do this in OneNote.   A lot of my "dismissed" tasks end up there.   A lot of other stuff just goes straight there.   It's my grasscatcher / ideacatcher / someday-maybe list.   I don't review it regularly, I just review it whenever I feel like reviewing it, which is maybe a few times per month.   Some of that stuff goes stale pretty fast, but some of it sparks new projects, new initiatives, new ideas, and I am glad I didn't simply delete it.</div>

<div class="content">One of the struggles I've had with DIT in the past, is that every task is assumed to be connected to a commitment, but that just isn't the case with me.   Just because I wrote it down on a list doesn't mean I'm committed to it.   If I write it on my Task Diary, then yes, there's an implicit commitment that I will at least ASSESS it, to see if I should make a deeper commitment.   But the fact that I skip over it and end up dismissing it, doesn't automatically mean I am overcommitted, it can also mean that I have performed a "de facto" assessment, and I am not committed to that task right now.   That doesn't mean I want to DELETE it - I may want to explore it later, I may want to commit to it later.    So it goes onto my Explore list.<br><br>This gives me a nice balance between "percolation" and "commitment".   <br><br>AF1 is really good about percolation, but doesn't really commit you to action till an individual task "stands out".   This is like Agile Scrum with a velocity of One Task, and you don't commit to that task till you actually start working on it, and your commitment is only "as long as I want to work on it".   Very commitment-light, and doesn't give a lot of visibility into what you (or your stakeholders) can expect in the future.   <br><br>DIT, on the other hand, is bad about percolation, but goes to the other extreme:  everything is an implicit commitment, like Agile Scrum with no backlog at all, everything that arrives goes onto the Commit List for the daily iteration.   <br><br>DIT with Dismissal and Explore List is a nice middle ground -- at least, it's worked out that way for me.</div>

If nothing else you have a high-level commitment to explore.<br><br>The same applies to any other TM system. You mention AF1 in this respect. It would not be difficult for anyone to identify common themes in the tasks I put into my AF list. <br><br>One has commitments whether one like it or not. The point of identifying them is to be able to ensure that they get carried out effectively. <br><br>To be successful a commitment needs "sufficient regular focused attention". it's obviously not going to get sufficient regular focused attention if too many other things are getting in the way.<br><br>Another of my maxims is "A commitment is as much about what you are not going to do as about what you are going to do."</div>

<div class="content">I tried DIT several days ago after getting the ebook for Do it Tomorrow, but after a few days I could not keep up.  I got sick for a few days, and fell behind.  On the weekends, I would not work, but work came in which I couldn't do until weekdays, so it piled up.   I found it hard to complete each days tasks.  I found it too strict and exacting to keep it up. There is so much concentrated thought in this thread, that I will read it thoroughly over a period of time, and I hope to be able to adapt some of it.  This is the kind of material I have been hoping to find.  Perhaps some combination of DIT and AF would be best.  Thanks for the thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">Despite all these other systems e.g. AF, FV etc, I'm still using DIT. Being a date-based system gives it advantages that have been lost in the other systems. DIT gives me a sense of accomplishment when I look back on the day and have completed everything on the list, and makes me feel like I'm in control and actually doing a good job for my employer. It allows some forward planning. It means that I'm becoming the reliable guy around the office.<br><br>Some tasks are best done on certain days, but they're not exactly "calendar appointments". When such a task comes up, rather than schedule it for tomorrow, I schedule it for that future day or date. So DIT becomes a tickler file as well as my to-do list - this alone has made me the most effective that I've been in a long time. I don't see how any "continuous list" system can have this benefit. The benefits of a tickler file are enormous but when I've tried to implement a tickler file, it always got neglected because of it being a separate system to my regular to-do list.<br><br>My frustration with DIT has been: What to do about previous days that don't get completed. As an example, last Thursday I had a list of things I wanted to do, and then my manager sent me out on customer visits all day - saying no was not an option. I scheduled one or two of these tasks per day for the next week, so that I didn't get a backlog, but if this happens a few times in a row then it sets up the following days with too much work and I'm likely to continue failing to complete the list.<br><br>Based on some ideas in this thread, maybe I'd be better not immediately carrying these tasks forward for a week, and instead only working on them after finishing the regular "full day's work" for the following week, and after a week declaring whatever's left as a backlog, deleting whatever I can, or putting it on my newly created "Explore" list. (Maybe this was covered in the book and I missed it?)<br><br>Thanks so much for the ideas :) I'm glad for discussion around DIT as I love continuous improvement but don't feel that any of the other systems have beat it, yet, at least for my needs. I'm keenly following this thread!</div>

<div class="content">Dan:<br><br>It sounds as if DIT is working pretty well for you. That's great.<br><br>In reply to a few of the points you made:<br><br><< So DIT becomes a tickler file as well as my to-do list - this alone has made me the most effective that I've been in a long time.

The easiest method is to enter deferred tasks in your diary/schedule. When you check your diary for the following day (I assume everyone does this whatever system they are using!) it's just a matter of entering the deferred items on your list.<br><br><< What to do about previous days that don't get completed. >><br><br>You work on yesterday's list and today's list as if they were one list.<br><br><< if this happens a few times in a row then it sets up the following days with too much work and I'm likely to continue failing to complete the list. >><br><br>If it happens a few times in a row, then it's no longer an isolated incident, but a regular occurrence. That means that you need to adjust your incoming/outgoing work balance. As it says in the book, there are three things you need to look at:<br><br>1. Whether you are working efficiently (Remedy: Improve your work systems)<br>2. Whether you have too much work. (Rememdy: Reduce your commitments)<br>3. Whether you are giving your work enough time.

Usually I'm given projects and responsibilities, and left to organise my own time, which is great. But sometimes we'll have a few short-staffed days and the resourcing manager will send me out of the office for several days, attending to appointments that were previously planned for our other staff members. This means that anything that was on my own lists gets delayed and there's nothing I can do about it, except to explain to my manger what is happening, which essentially has no effect. This is not the norm, by the way, it just happens sometimes when we're short staffed due to illness or other factors.</div>

The answer then is to write future tasks straight into your list in a way that allows you to visually skip over them, not dot them, and process them only once a day. <br><br>Assuming you leave a little-finger-sized space between the left margin of your notebook and your tasks—so as to easily add and see your dots—simply write the date for that future task in that space, followed by the task, and then visually skip all such items during your normal scans. <br><br>At the close of each day, scan down your list looking only at the dated items until you come to an item with tomorrow's date. When you come across such an item, cross it off and rewrite it at the end of your list without the date and with the word "Today" in front of it.<br><br><br>Example:<br><br> ⁣⁣ ⁣•⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ Feed neighborhood rabid dog<br>5/30⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣Pay electric bill<br> ⁣⁣ ⁣•⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ Return red stapler<br> ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣  ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣Invent jump to conclusions game<br> ⁣⁣ ⁣• ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ Write Dan solution on TM forum<br><br><br>The evening of the 29th this becomes:<br><br> ⁣⁣ ⁣•⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣Feed neighborhood rabid dog<br> ⁣⁣ ⁣•⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣Return red stapler<br> ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣  ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣Invent jump to conclusions game<br> ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣  ⁣⁣ ⁣ Today: Pay electric bill<br><br><br>As you can tell from my example list, it's always best to feed rabid dogs in the evening.

<div class="content">It's useful to remember that a lot of the problems people have with one system rather than another are caused simply because they haven't learned the system yet properly. It takes time to internalize a system.<br><br>As an analogy, when you start to drive a new car a lot of the controls and the way the car feels are different from your old car. These can make you feel uncomfortable initially. But after a couple of weeks you no longer even notice the differences.</div>

<div class="content">I've only gotten through chapter 5 of DIT so far, but it's already inspiring me to think hard about my commitments. Not so much the meaningful commitments that I make to other people, but the meaningless, time-consuming commitments that I make to myself. <br><br>As a child, I was taught - aggressively - that it's a terrible character flaw to ever quit or give up on ANYTHING. They left out an important corollary: It's better to be a "quitter" than to cling to a project, a habit, a relationship, an object, a concept, or anything else, no matter how comfortable it is or how long you've been committed to it, once it becomes clear that the "commitment" is a bad one (however you want to define "bad"). <br><br>Some of my "commitments" cause me more trouble than they're worth, and they don't help anyone else either. Or they are mildly helpful, but ditching them would make way for more meaningful commitments. I know this, but letting go of them still feels "wrong." It's very helpful to be reminded of the impact that commitments have on our time.</div>

<div class="content">Michael, thanks for explaining how to add tickler functionality to a list. For a long time I've considered trying a 43 folders system, but that seemed like overkill for what I need to do. What you describe is more lightweight and flexible, and can work with pretty much any type of list.<br><br>(43 folders would be overkill for me, but a 12 folders system might be just right.

<div class="content">I still feel that DIT is one of Mark's better systems, and with recent developments in time management theory, it's even better. For recent concepts like focusing on 80/20 results, minimizing commitments, and creating work/life balance, DIT is great. It feels like the main problem people have with it is execution and resistance to tasks, and Mark's later systems address this, but I feel they lose DIT's day-based structure and its ability to handle projects.<br><br>To improve DIT, I'd probably just create the daily list, and break each big task down into steps. Each step can be broken down further as needed during the day. This way, you can dramatically increase your ability to work through bigger and more difficult tasks. It takes some practice upfront, but mastering this way of working will give you straightforward results.</div>
