<div class="content">Following on from another thread about the type of notebook used I remembered that 'Pascal' wanted a 42 line notebook so he could achieve the meaning of life (reference to Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, for the uninitiated) while implementing the Autofocus system.<br><br>In the same thread Mark was saying that he felt the system worked best the more lines on a page there were.<br><br>Today in WH Smiths I found a notebook with 43 lines (surely a record?). It was a quick count; it could have been 42 lines... but hey, what's a line or two between friends!<br><br>The Oxford International notebooks have 6mm lines and roughly 43 lines per page. The sheets are perforated and punched so they can be neatly torn out and filed in a regular A4 binder if necessary. They are ring-bound so fold over easily and have a hardback cover so they're nice and sturdy to write on. The expensive versions have removable dividers too and a pocket on the inside to store a few loose papers. I've bought one to trial. It's the Filing Notebook version which is quite expensive (£10 - although I've seen deals on the internet to buy 5 for £35 including postage). <br><br>Anyways, for similarly stationery obsessed peeps I hope this will be useful information!</div>

<div class="content">I have not been able to get my mind around using a bound book.  I have found it more useful to use looseleaf paper and have attached all relevant documents for that page (eg: bills, articles to read, forms to fill, etc) to the list with an elastic band. So each page has its own set of attachments. I find this way I'm not searching for the item I need to complete and its faster.  Am loving the system so far.  Still trying to get all routine tasks into the list and trying to figure out how to incorporate certain day specific/weekend tasks into the list as well (so as to avoid having 2 systems).<br></div>
