<div class="content">I use Palm Treo with Windows Mobile (I use SPB Diary). I want to use little&often approach but came to limitations of electronic setup. Let say I read through a list of task. Stop at a task I want to do. When done I'd like it to be crossed off and go down the list. I'm not a guru in programming and specially Windows Mobile. Anyone could help?</div>

<div class="content">Eugene: There is no need to sync ListPro. If you keep the files on an SD card, you can open them directly from your PC when your SmartPhone is connected.<br><br>When you have worked on a task, just drag it to the bottom of the list.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence:<br><br>You're saying store the ListProfile ONLY on the SD card in the SmartPhone?<br><br>Interesting, if so, but I've already got the PC and SP versions and they just synchronise whenever I do connect the SP, but I have other reasons for synchronising, such as Outlook for my contacts and appointments.<br><br>BTW, have you sussed out how to do a mass change in ListPro eg changing a date or a status, or a context?  I've had a look at the documentation, nothing stands out.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger: Yes, I always open my file direct from the SD card onto the main PC but ... I keep it in a folder My Mobile Dropbox (along with other things) which I regularly synchronize (with SyncToy) to a similarly named folder in My Dropbox on the main PC, which gives me main PC and internet backups just in case!<br><br>Using the file stored on the SD card is noticably slower at times, but it is quite adequate. Before disconnecting the smartphone, I always click the "Safely remove hardware" button in the taskbar as a precaution. While away from my PC I use the file on the smartphone.<br><br>Re doing a mass change, I found one can do it via Excel. Highlight all the records in ListPro, copy and paste into a blank Excel sheet. Do search and replace (or whatever), then copy the rectangle of cells in Excel, highlight the last row in ListPro and paste back.<br><br>If you are changing the table structure in ListPro, do so before copying and pasting to Excel.<br><br>Hope this helps :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Laurence, for feedback.<br><br>I've just started using DropBox, must find about Mobile DropBox.<br><br>So you're syncing with SyncToy AND DropBox.  Do you use OneNote as well?  I want to clean up my OneNote, then start syncing with my netbook.  <br><br>On the advice of some forum members as well as Microsoft, I'm not going to sync Outlook other than with my SmartPhone, and I only want appointments and contacts anyway.</div>

<div class="content">Roger:<br><br>The My Mobile Dropbox folder is just my "hack" to ensure my list gets backed up to the Net. There is no Dropbox for Windows Mobile (although there is for the iPhone). So SynchToy shunts my file to the desktop within my DropBox folder, which gets backed up to the net automatically.<br><br>I did try using Allway Sync for a while, which works in the background synchronizing every time a file changes. But I found it did not play nice with open ListPro files, so it was back to SynchToy.<br><br>Not using OneNote. Just a very simple ListPro list.<br><br>Re ActiveSync, I am using Microsoft Exchange to synch calendar and contacts with Google, it works with my old phone but I have heard there are problems with WM6.5. Not really using ActiveSync directly to the desktop any more.</div>
