<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br><br>On February 12, I started a poll to see which of Mark's systems were being used.  It is time to see if that has changed any, particularly since this forum has evolved so much since then -- and it really quiet as of late.  I am particularly interested to see if there is a cadre of DIT users still out there -- and how long they have stayed with DIT.  <br><br>So...what system are you using?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, I posted a question for you on the discussion thread about using AF1. I'm really interested in what you've found to be the key distinctions between AF1 and AF4, and why you switched back to AF1. I'm currently using Omnifocus but I am contemplating lists on paper again and so am very interested in your insights.<br>Thanks, Claudia</div>

<div class="content">Hi Claudia,<br><br>I love using paper and cannot see going back to digital!  As for AF1 vs. AF4, they are both excellent, but the physical one-page approach of AF1 is what attracted me.<br><br>However....now...I am thinking very seriously to going back to what I loved the most...DIT in a Moleskin notebook.  While AF works well, I still miss the closed list for the day approach.  DIT puts one in control of one's day more so than any other system I have tried.  It is all about focus for me and not being so scattered.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Frank. <br><br>I'm quite taken by Robbin's idea that large to-do lists are (mostly) a distraction from accomplishing our major goals. Also, hitting targets/goals are often done with tasks NOT on our to-do lists.  The more I internalize these ideas, the less I'm concerned with "How many of these items did I check off today?". Besides, I've had too many "successful" AF/DWM/GTD days where I went to bed without touching any of my major goals.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-06-9 7:21</div>
<div class="content">Yeah, what Avrum said and for many of the same reasons.  I basically think that the "bottom up" approach to life is wrong for me.  I need to work top down.  So I've abandoned all of the AF systems, and returned to my Grass Catcher approach  where I pull items onto a focused (targeted) list a la OPA, and then schedule time to get those things done.<br><br>I think that seeing "Wash Dishes" next to "Call Doctor" just drove me nuts after a while.  If I'm cleaning house I want to think only of that.  If I'm managing my health I want to see those items together. <br><br>I found this also to be true in my reading.  I tried Mark's idea of a "reading shelf" and that drove me nuts too.  It was crazy making to see three feet of books on various subjects and have to pick the "next in line" ... or even worse, browse the whole thing.  I'm back to reading a single book in large dedicated reading sessions to keep my focus on what I'm doing.<br><br>FWIW, if I had to say what the ONE thing I found problematic with the AF systems was it would be that they destroyed my focus.  It is kind of like the problem my wife has at a restaurant.  She gets LOST in the menu, mentally sampling each thing and not being able to order until the waitress comes back for the forth time.  LOL ;-)  My AF list became a big black hole in my day as I reread every item for the umpteenth time.  Now I just have a very few items and I KNOW they will all get done today and they are all allocated a time to be done so my watch tells me what to do next.</div>

But we are all different and what works for one may not work for another and vice versa. <br><br>I've also never understood the problem you have with "Wash Dishes" next to "Call Doctor" - that's precisely the sort of choice that life presents us with all the time.<br><br>I do resonate with your wife's problems with menus - but funnily enough I've never yet had to leave a restaurant without eating because I can't make up my mind!</div>

<div class="content">Hey Mark,<br><br>Good to see you back!<br><br>>>>  I hope that your new system continues to work for you. I have to say that I've never managed to get that type of system to work for more than a short period of time. But we are all different and what works for one may not work for another and vice versa.  <<<<br><br>Exactly.  I've never seen Seraphim so happy for so long, for example.  DWM is just the right combination for his personality and context.  As for what works for me ... I'm starting to think that looking for the perfect system is not the way for me to go.  The basic thing is that I have to DO stuff and a lot of it is stuff I'd rather not DO.  So what I need to do is to DO it ;-)<br><br>Yeah, it is an old cliche: "Just do it!", but I think that is what it really comes down to.  So my return to basics, if you want to call it that, amounts to acknowledging that I don't want to do some things but that I don't HAVE to want to do them ... I just have to DO them.  So the effort I put into trying to overcome resistance is better spent just doing the damn task and getting it behind me.<br><br>A couple of days ago my wife noted that the grass was getting long and suggested we hire someone.  Not being as dim as you might think, I correctly interpreted that to mean I should go mow the grass ;-)  My choice was to put it on a list and fuss with when I felt ready to do it or just get out the mower and MOW the damn lawn.  I hated it more than I can express, but it got done without it going on to any list, and my wife was happy.  Much happier than she'd have been than if I'd have shown her my list and explained how I was overcoming resistance ;-)  She teaches music to about 190 kids so she does not have a whole lot of empathy for my delicate sensibilities.  The other day she told me that when I go, she knows exactly how to build the funeral pyre ... she's going to use all of my old lists! ;-) <br><br>That is just my take on it and I am not suggesting that others see things the same way.  I AM taking a big hint from Vickie, though.  I am willing to play some mind games to get through the tough stuff ... so long as the game results in my actually doing the work.  Having a list is not doing the work ... it is having a list of work to do.<br><br>FWIW, I found that the biggest help so far is to know why I want to do something and then deciding that I will do it.  After that it might come down to gaming myself to start it or keep at it when I want to quit, but usually once I have the reason and have made the decision I can manage the rest.<br><br>AND, as long as I've mentioned Vickie, I have to say that her best tip so far was her attitude toward Monday.  She celebrates it because it is her golden opportunity to do extra junk she'd rather not do so that she can "buy" free time to do fun things later in the week.  I'm thinking of having that carved into a stone plaque for my desk ;-)<br><br>>>>  I've also never understood the problem you have with "Wash Dishes" next to "Call Doctor" - that's precisely the sort of choice that life presents us with all the time.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, it is the choice life presents us, but scheduling is my choice, not random input from life, so it makes sense for my system to reflect how I think rather then mimic the randomness of life's challenges.<br><br>>>>  I do resonate with your wife's problems with menus - but funnily enough I've never yet had to leave a restaurant without eating because I can't make up my mind!   <<<<br><br>Nor has my wife.  However, I have left my list still "hungry" because I could  not make up mine.  ;-)  But thinking more about it, there is a similarity.  I've noticed that she has trouble because she sees choosing the burger as forever missing out on the wings.  I can't convince her that she will eat again some day ;-)  Yet that is exactly what happens in my head when I look at what I need to work on.  It seems as if choosing "mow the lawn" cuts off my "Read Book" ... obviously I can read the book later, but when I'm considering my day I tend to expect to do too much because there is so much I want to do and I don't want stuff to be "missed".  Silly, but then these things usually are ;-)</div>

<div class="content">What is the point of these systems?<br><br>As I see it, they have 2 fundamental functions:<br><br>  1. Organize<br>  2. Motivate<br><br>The Organize function is necessary because it's hard to keep more than "seven plus or minus two" items in our awareness at one time. I notice this happening to me all the time. I get emotionally hijacked by one thing, and then realize that there were a lot of other things on my list that I completely lost all awareness of. <br><br>I used to think that the manner in which things are organized made a huge difference. I no longer believe that to be the case. I do think it's important for me to get stuff "out of my head" and written down, because of the 7 +/- 2, or "limited RAM" problem, mentioned above. But whether the lists are flat, or hierarchically structured, or have lines dividing them into sections, no longer strikes me as important as the main function of getting stuff written down.<br><br>There is some controversy over whether a list can Motivate. I have found that a well-structured list is highly motivating for me. A poorly-structured list will be much less motivating.<br><br>I am not saying that the list's structure is the only--or even the most important--determinant of motivation. Obviously, if you have a job that is consistent with your long-term goals and with your values, you might find yourself more highly motivated. But, the way a list is structured can make a difference. If it can increase my motivation to do something by 10-15%, I view that as significant.<br><br>I agree with Mike, Mark, and a thousand other psychologists and gurus. Action precedes motivation. If you wait till you feel like doing something, you have a problem. It works the other way around. Do it. Then, after you start doing, you start to feel motivated. Another way to express this, which I learned from he-who-cannot-be-named, is that I can feel one way and act the opposite. I can feel like avoiding the ugly task on my desk and do it anyway.<br><br>With all that said, I heartily throw myself in Seraphim's camp. I love, love, love, DWM. My particular implementation is still Walter's Excel DWM. <br><br>With regard to Organization, my list stays manageable in its size. I currently have 74 active items. The list itself is subdivided into sections, each representing an expiration date. The items that are due to expire at the end of today constitute a section that has particular salience to me and gets a lot of my focus.<br><br>With regard to Motivation, the expiration dates really keep me on my toes and honest with myself. Could I be better? Yes. Do I still procrastinate? Yes. Are there times when I worked on X, when it might have made more sense to work on Y? Yes. But, overall, I have been spending a lot more time focused on the more important stuff and a lot less time on the other stuff. I have let a lot of things that I put on my list drop away. After more careful consideration, they either were not that important, or I just was not clear on exactly what I was trying to accomplish.<br><br>What I have found is that one of the keys to making the system work is to write on my list whatever I am about to do, right before I do it. If I am going to go on markforster.net, that's OK, as long as I write it on my list first and then highlight it as the active task. This keeps me honest. And Walter's system provides me with a record of how much time I spent doing everything. <br><br>In summary, just DOING it, is the solution. There is no substitute for doing it. But DWM (in Excel) is the best system I've ever used. At this point, I am not looking for anything else. Perhaps my imagination is too limited, but I cannot envision a system better than the one I have.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, that is the problem with OPA ... there is no good app to make it work smoothly.  I think Robbins dabbled in software development but I heard that crased and burned when I found out the harsh reality of softwrare development.<br><br>I have my projects described in a notebook and I just manage tasks in Toodledo on the net.  I group the tasks by project and I sharpen the outcomes and purposes continually and have them in front of me when I do my scheduling.  I schedule the tasks with Pocket Informant on my iPhone which pulls the tasks and durations from Toodledo.<br><br>If I had my druthers I'd like it if I could keep the outcomes and purposes associated with the project folder or goals in Toodledo and be able to see them in PI, but neither of those  have that capability.  If that were of overriding importance I'd have to fall back to a more manual method such as sticking with paper or using Excel or Word or something.  But for now, I like that I can have things on my iPhone.  It is important to have everything in one place.  I seldom forget my iPhone but I regularly find my notebooks wandering off.<br><br>Avrum, thanks for the links.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, Tony Robbin's disastrous attempt at a software implementation of OPA was a great example of how to upset a great number of customers in a short space of time, including me :)<br><br>I think it was only topped by Franklin Covey's even worse attempt at a software implementation of Stephen Covey's ideas.<br><br>I tried to make "top down" work for years - mainly OPA/RPM-based...really, really tried...but eventually decided it doesn't work in the "real world".<br><br>In a perfect world, "top down" would be how we do everything. Unfortunately, life just doesn't operate that neatly, unless you are Tony Robbins and have complete control of your day to day activities, and probably *don't* have large numbers of new tasks flying at you daily at extreme speed.<br><br>I think the enormous popularity of David Allen's GTD (which is "bottom up") perhaps illustrates the reality that "top down" is ideal but "bottom up" is practical.<br><br>Personally, I've learned over the years that there is an intuitive part of me that knows the right time to work on larger goals if I trust it, and I find that the AF's allow that part to have a say at the right time.</div>

So top-down works for me. <br><br>"top down" is ideal but "bottom up" is practical."<br><br>Funny - I never found GTD practical. It felt forced. AF/DWM felt practical - though the scanning through tasks - while a neat idea - created dread for the system. The #1 component of DWM/AF that I support is the dating of tasks. I don't do this anymore (because each day is planned afresh), but I think it is a good idea.</div>

<div class="content">Software Systems Development: The problem is that those who don't know what it is about think it is the same thing as "writing code" so they hire children who know how to play video games but have no clue about systems.<br><br>Top/Bottom:  I think it all depends on what you do and how you manage it.  I spent some years being reactive ... in my early years I had jobs that were totally reactive.  I answered hot line calls for a large computer service provider, for example so each time the phone rang what I did next was determined by the voice on the phone (bottom up).  OTOH, even in that environment, I managed to conceive of, design and implement a computer system to streamline some processes.  That was entirely top down.<br><br>My point is that I found a way to make a choice that allowed me to take control of at least a portion of my time.  Not everyone in that office cared to do that.  It is a choice, not just how life is.  One option that I've never found applicable to me is to outsource common but time consuming tasks that are outside of what interest me.  Avrum lists some of the obvious things but my wife has some suggestions of her own (like hire a gardening service).  It is a balancing act.  You don't have to have "minions" working for you, you can hire them by the hour when needed to free unstructured time from the clutches of structured time.<br><br>It is also a question of degree.  Looking at it from the macro vantage point, there is no way that we do even a large percentage of things ourselves.  We don't raise cows ... we buy milk at the store.  That is, in essence, outsourcing a service.  I draw my line based in my available time, capability, and financial resources.  If I had unlimited funds I'd outsource everything I did not absolutely love doing.  But right now, I value the $100 or so I'd have to pay a lawn service each week to mow the lawn.  But I "pay" about two hours of my time.  That is just a calculation I make.<br><br>Now I'm going out looking for some minions ;-)</div>

<div class="content">80, semi-retired, tried most all of 'em.  Autofocus 1...x, DIT, DWM, GTD, DIY, calendars, daybooks, notebooks, computer programs, etc.  Some work for me, some not so well, some are overkill. But what is working very well for me now is Task PRO.app on my iPod Touch.  (No, I haven't any interest or association with either AlifSoft or Apple.)  This is a well thought out, easy to use, many sub-level nested, list program that works from simple to dos and appointments to complex projects.  Dates, times, priorities, emphasis, categories, tags- it's all there. No loose paper & pencil & bulky notebook- everything I need fits in my shirt pocket.  But keep on trying for a better way.

I was thinking about returning to DIT, and while there are significant strengths to this system in terms of focus, if one has a position like mine where there are multiple demands and things can change within a day (2010 reality), I like the greater flexibility of AF1.  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Some very interesting reading here, personally I love getting a glimpse of other people's time management schemes. Although of course I keep reminding myself, we don't manage time, we manage ourselves.<br><br>I have gone back to a hybrid AF system in a spiral notebook, where I chuck down anything and everything. The back pages are a sort of shopping list and the middle pages are for telephone numbers, addresses and other such information I need to store elsewhere.  <br><br>I take some time in the morning to meditate on my life goals, weekly goals and if neccessary daily goals, write them on cards and clip them to the front of the notebook, just to keep me on track.<br><br>One of my co-workers uses the GTD system, and he wrote "Book of Stuff" on the front cover of my notebook :-)<br>I suppose for a GTD user it is an amorphous mass of unclassified stuff, but it works for me.<br> <br>As David said, it's a question of flexibility.

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Mike and Avrum's conversions out of Mark's time management systems (TMS's) have made me look closer into the workings of AF/DWM and determine whether it can be used with the classic "top down" TMS "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" by Steven Covey. I realized that AF's strengths of intuition, flexibility and "little and often" approach might compensate for 7Habit's weaknesses of inflexibility and impracticality of self-imposed deadlines and schedules, while alleviating AF's greatest weakness: lack of direction.<br><br>For the past 4 days I have been experimenting with a Seven Habits/Autofocus 4 hybrid TMS...no name yet.  It seems to be very promising; indeed, it has helped me plow through procrastination. In its current form, I still have problems with making the selection of tasks more simple and less, uhm, buggy, but it has already shown to be very effective in handling urgent as well as important tasks, and it seems to have the strengths of AF of flexibility and "little and often" while rigid enough to be strict in weeding out, through the system itself, less important tasks in relation to one's goals.<br><br>I will experiment more on this TMS, and I will publish my experiences in this forum...especially when I have codified the instructions for it.</div>

In particular, they have begun to regulate things environmental (and yet the monster oil spill seems to be beyond them ... possibly because they have accepted bribes from the oil industry for so long).  In the situation i refer to congress mandated that the production of toilets be limited to those designed to use one or fewer gallons of water per flush.  Of course the ... errrr, material ... would not be carried away with such a small amount of water so, logically, we have taken to flushing TWICE.  (Which results in more water usage than before.)

I used to play in a gas station as well.  The dirt around there was thick with spilled oil ... and yet I'm still here.  AND, haning around the gas station resulted in my being able to rebuild motorcycles and cars and playing with mercury and such resulted in my building ham radio and hi-fi (old term ;-) equipment.  (More on this below.)<br><br>>>>   Wrapping kids up in cotton wool is - well, a waste of cotton wool.

I read an article recently where some concerned scientists were protesting how much we "protect" our kids.  What they cited in particular was the inability of a citizen of our fair land to buy a real chemistry set.  The best you can do in this brave new world is to buy a book of instructions of things you can do to play with food in the kitchen.  (Mix vinegar and baking soda to produce a fizz, for example.)  In my youth my dad built me a real workbench and bought me a monster chemistry set ... the thing fold out to four panels and I could do real "experiments".  Now clearly, to me, "experiments" mostly meant producing bad smells, smoke and explosions ... and that is exactly the point that ht scientists were making.  You can't get kids interested in science if they don't have an early interest in science.  IOW, it has to be fun.  Producing a fizz in the kitchen is not FUN and they will wander off and not want to be scientists.  In addition, without danger nothing happens.  Kids have to risk breaking bones in order to grow in any way.  They simply can't be protected from life!<br><br>As I said, I set off my share of explosions, but I also spent my working life in the science and technology area as a result of my interest.  I can't remember a time of my life when I did not have wrenches and soldering irons within reach.  Today kids know more about how to "cheat" games than make things with junk parts.  This is an intolerable situation and bodes ill for our future.  (Note: I get that an interest in video games leads to an interest in software and that is a good thing.  But software is not hardware.  IOW, you have to have hardware to run software and if we don't develop a workforce comfortable with tearing REAL things apart we will lose our edge in hard science and industry.)<br><br>>>>  "How did we ever manage to become the dominant species on this plant being so fragile and incompetent for so long?

<div class="content">"Actually my own experience tells me that the most important thing about any system is that once you've got it working reasonably well you just stick to it."<br><br>This is key! That's why I got a chuckle out of Walter's comment that DWM is "boring." Now, I have nothing but the warmest feelings towards Walter, and I remain forever in his debt for his brilliant Excel app. And I would have to say, isn't it great that DWM is boring? The occasional excitement in my life comes from what I am doing, not the system I use to track what I do.<br><br>The best system is the one I can stick with. This is why I (and, perhaps David Drake) liked GTD. I tried Lakein, but couldn't stick with it. I tried Covey, but couldn't stick with it. Once I found GTD, I had a system which worked for me for years. Later I found DIT, then AF, and DWM. Mark's systems did significantly increase my efficiency. GTD got me from 0 to 55. Mark's got me from 55 to 85. To get from 85 to 100, I believe, at this point involves making cognitive-conative changes to myself, not using different systems.<br><br>"Continually changing systems around is nothing other than a form of procrastination.<br><br>Fortunately, I do not have a big problem with this. My goal has always been to get my system to disappear. It's kind of like grammar. Most of the time, when I use language, I am not thinking about grammar. I am using grammar, but it fades into the background. I am thinking about the meaning of what I am saying. I am thinking about the informational content. Occasionally, when I make some egregious solecism, I momentarily think about grammar. But, on my good days, it just disappears. <br><br>That's my goal for my systems. <br><br>"And yes, I plead guilty!"<br><br>At this point, I feel that if Mark came up with a new system, I'd stick with DWM. I can't imagine getting much value from a different system. But, I've said that before. And once I start reading all the rave reviews of whatever it is that Mark comes up with, I can't resist trying.</div>

In my AF1 list I just cross off "check email" when I'm done for the moment and re-enter it below.  AF1 really does encourage the "little and often" approach, which is one of Mark's cardinal principles.

The described system is the first which I havn’t tweaked after a few days working with it. Now it becomes so natural, that I’m in the flow with it. This and Davids’ thread had motivated me to post this description.<br><br>@Jep<br>The answer from nuntym re: repetive task is correct. I handle this as he described. <br>BTW regarding Email as example: Email is without the ‘!’ reentered. If I had done YESTERDAYs email (because it’s on my todays list)  I only check three or  fore times a day my inbox if there are same-day-urgent (todays) emails ticking. I handle them before they explode. The others have to wait until tomorrow (as Mark described in his intriguing book DiT).<br><br>@Mark<br><<What I can't quite grasp is what you do with same day stuff that comes in during the day (as it tends to). Do you leave off the old stuff and move back to the new stuff?>><br><br>Mark, if same-day-stuff comes in I add it at the end of the list with an “!”. I go back where I left. My mind knows that there is something waiting for me ;-) Therefore, processing will be accelerated in order to reach this tasks (depending on serveral factors like available time, grad of urgency, consequences if doing it late in the day, etc.). <br>If it has to be done NOW – it isn’t a matter for the list. I do it right away – as you alsways suggested. If the house is burning I don’t put “! escape” on my list ;-)<br>BTW, I’m very selective with same-day-urgent stuff. I think twice if it really, really, relly² can’t wait until tomorrow. Ask: “What will happen if I don’t do it today?” – Compare the answer to your life-situation. My life-situation provides the best wife ever and two nice children who are waiting for me at home. So it’s mostly a pretty simple decision ;-)<br><br><< this doesn't really seem to be much improvement over AF1's rule that if something needs doing now you do it now.>><br><br>Right, but I always missed the closed DiT-list in AF1. This is the ONLY reason for me to marriage your AF1 and DiT. It has also the benefit, that tasks which can’t be done today moves automaically to the AF-section where they will be processed by AF (done, done/reentered or dismissed). Here I see a difference to AF1 for itself.<br><br><< at the moment I am working on something else and can't break off to try this out.>><br><br>Gook luck with whatever you do!</div>

<div class="content">Hey Laurence,<br><br>>>>  Going back to grass catching, Mike, it all comes down to focus. <<<<br><br>The way I see it is that grass catching does not have to do with focus ... or even getting anything done.  It is just a way to capture what is on your mind and getting off your mind.  Most of those things are, or come down in practice to, things that must be done.  The focus part comes about when you put them into some system that manages the doing part.<br><br>>>>   The approach of Mark's systems is (or was originally) an automatic focusing, to bring attention to where our life is going and whether we want that.  <<<<br><br>Ah, so I never got that concept.  I took "auto FOCUS" to mean that it was designed to focus your attention on what to do next.<br><br>>>>  So in terms of the grass cutting episode, an alternative is to let your garden grow wild and write the great American satirical novel. Possibly in the shade of that lovely long grass :-)  <<<<br><br>In the example I gave, I would have been not only in the shade of the lovely long grass, but underneath the sod itself ... as that is where my wife would have planted me.<br><br>But seriously, that illustrates what is wrong with AF (speaking for me).  I am not looking for something to tell me where my life is going but to help me get things done.  In my view none of this is complicated.  It does not require very complex systems to tell me what to do.  I have a list of everything I need to do ... I just need to narrow it down to what is most important right now.  I don't leave that up to my mood or the whim of the moment.  I look at my plans and pick what has to be done next, block out time in my schedule to do it, then do it.  Easy peasy.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jens,<br><br>I am going to give your approach a try -- I am currently doing AF1, so this will not be that drastic of a change.  I have one question.  One focuses on the list for today, and after doing some tasks, none stand out, one then goes into the "backlog" or AF section.  There you state that one should process this per normal AF1 rules.  But what is the trigger for coming back to the remaining tasks in the daily list?  Or once you have left these because none stood out, you stay in the AF section for the remainder of the day.  I fully understand the same-day urgent tasks.<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

Thus todays incoming stuff which is not same-day-urgent (95%; as I mentioned I'm very selective on this) won't bother my today.

<div class="content">Hi nuntym<br><br>I didn't use the word purpose, but you chose it well. In life we are led more and more to work for the purposes of others, whether in school, the workplace, the family, the religious community . . . even when going shopping or on holiday we are often responding to advertising, i.e. the purposes of a manufacturer. Likewise purpose can be a response to peer pressure.<br><br>In Mark's systems there has always been the concept of looking for a task which stands out. If you choose to add tasks which reflect your most authentic purpose, or which facilitate the discovery and evolution of it, the systems have an additional pyschological dimension.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thanks for the comment on rail travel.  I do know that rail travel in the US is much more than it really should be.  Over $100 just to get from DC to NYC.  Awful.  It looks like a week or so of rail pass is about $300-$400, if memory serves.<br><br>The travel forums I've visited advised against driving as public transportation is so much more convenient ... assuming the Italians are not trying to piss people off with a rail strike!

It is just one of those situations where language forms mental constructs which, in this case, are not necessarily helpful, IMO.

You can get from Rome to Florence for about €25 on a regular train, or double that price on a high-speed train. It's just that buying separate tickets can be a hassle: usually there are *long* lines at the ticket counters and ticket vending machines (especially in cities like Rome or Florence), plus *buying* a ticket is not enough, you need to validate it at the platform before boarding your train.<br><br>Looks like we're not going to meet then, I'll be flying to Rome the 18th of July.

About the reservations: you only need reservations for international trains (even if you're travelling it only in Italy) and for high-speed trains. On the high-speed trains your reservation is checked when boarding, but not on the international trains, and most Italians don't even bother to get a reservation on those trains.</div>

<div class="content">Tijl,<br>thanks for implementing AF1DiT to your app, although I don't have an iphone :-( <br><br>As I answered David June 16, 2010 at 16:06:<br><br>"While I'm in AF1-mode I consider the todays section as part of the AF-Area and work on it with AF1 rules, but without dismissing tasks. <br>If I reach the dashed-line (beginning of Tomorrows list) I scan after "!" as described in my first post."<br><br>This means, after handling same-day-urgent and todays task I switch mentaly (because I don't have an iphone - haven't I mentioned this? ;-) to AF1mode including todays section. I don't include tomorrow items, which are not same-day-urgent to achieve the effect of DiT.<br><br>Hope this helps. <br><br>BTW, I suppose that one of the not so obvious benefits of combining AF1 with DiT is that <br>because of a DiT-mindset, items in the today-section have another seduction to get done(standing-out) compared to AF1. Thus, more current items will get done. Items which won't get done from the today-list will be left for AF1. If the DiT-effect is not desired, I highly recommend to stay in plain-AF1, due to it's balanced way of handling tasks.<br><br>Bye, Jens<br>P.S. David: you mentioned that you will try AF1DiT - how is it going?</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>I am now back to AF1 since a few weeks ago...*sigh* there is no beating simplicity, I guess.<br><br>BUT, I think I have found something even more simple...so simple in fact I am scratching my head how come I haven't encountered or thought of this before.  The only requirement is that you must have a list of tasks ready; aside from that, it will work on any existing list of tasks, whether electronic or paper, AF or DWM or GTD or whatever.<br><br>The steps (using paper):<br><br>1) Scan your list of tasks and pick one.  You may use the rules of whatever time management system you are using, or you may treat the task list as one big whole and scan through everything.<br>2) Cross out that item, then write it on something that is separate from your task list.  It may be a piece of paper, the back of your notebook, an index card, etc.  As for me, I use a 1 1/2" x 2" Post It and stick it on the front of my notebook.<br>3) Scan for and transfer TWO more tasks using the above rules.  You should now have three tasks.  Let us call this the "Microfocus" (MF) list.<br>4) Do those items in any way you want, but ONLY those three items.  <br>5) If there is a urgent task that has to be done now, cross out one of the tasks in your MF list, write the urgent task there (if you have time; you can still add it later then cross it out; as for the importance of writing what you have done in the MF list, see step # 8 below)<br>6) Cross out each task once it is done.<br>7) You can still add tasks at your big list of tasks, but resist the temptation to add to the MF list unless the task is urgent<br>8) Once all of the MF tasks are crossed out, re enter recurring tasks into your big list.<br>9) Repeat<br><br>I think it works for me because you consider only one very small list at a time.  Even with the rules of AF/DWM, the mere fact that you have more than a few tasks per consideration can produce overwhelm.  Also, it facilitates choosing of tasks: from the big list, you eliminate or lessen the temptation to choose items because they are easy to do; all items have similar difficulty in WRITING them down on a separate paper.  Then when you go to the MF list, choosing a task is not so important anymore because the choices are so few! You do the easy or difficult task first, it does not matter; you be doing the others right after it.<br><br>Anyways, I hope this helps some of you.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Rainer,<br><br>I've just read GSD, and it is a bit different.  GSD is a whole system in itself, and it picks out 3-4 "most important items" by marking them in the list with a dot in the tickbox beside it.<br><br>MF, on the other hand, is more of a supplement.  You can use it in conjunction with a preexisting system like AF, DWM, GTD, or even GSD.  Also, you re-write ONLY the three items you have to do next, and in a place separate from your master list of task.  It could be in a mobile device, scrap of paper, an index card, the back of your notebook, or what not.  This is to reduce overwhelm, as now you do not see a whole page of tasks to do later, but just a measly list of three items.<br><br>However, I am intrigued by Bill Westerman's insistence, like in GTD, of wording "a task that I can actually do. Not 'figure out dishwasher repair', but 'make list of five dishwasher repair people and phone numbers'".  I'll try to add a step like that in MF ("If needed, rewrite the task to specify something that you can actually do now") and make a trial run of it.<br><br>Thank you very much, Rainer.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nuntym,<br><br>I'm doing something similar with my DWM list.  My list is very long, so I can't easily scan through it and choose three items.  I do this instead:<br><br>(1) I work through the list as per the regular DWM rules.  If something "stands out" then I try to work on it, little and often.  If something "stands out", but I just don't feel like working on it right this second, usually because I am distracted by minutiae and this particular item is larger and needs more extended attention, then I flag it as "important" (I'm using Microsoft Outlook, so I just set Priority = Important, but you could do it with paper by putting an exclamation mark next to the task or something).<br><br>(2) After a pass through the list, mostly spent acting on minutiae and refreshing my memory as to what's currently on the list, I then work through the list again.  But this time, I only look at the items flagged "important".  With Outlook, this is easy -- I just filter the list to show Important items only.<br><br>(3) After I work through this list, I then show all the tasks again, and work through it as normal.<br><br><br>I then alternate between the full list and the filtered list.  This helps balance my attention so I cover the little things as well as the more substantial things.<br><br>This idea was an outgrowth of Mark's idea to flag something for "must do next pass".  I often had 10-12 items flagged as "must do next pass", and I wanted to look through those to see which was really most important / urgent.  The flag came to mean "this is important, do it as soon as you can".  <br><br>Sometimes I start the day focusing only on the items already flagged "important" -- this functions kind of like the "current initiative" idea.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Seraphim. I'm already flagging with (!) on "important" or "must do next pass" tasks. I like your variation, and can easily filter on (!) using AFAHK capslock-F find function. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">The GSD system looks interesting, but I would be worried about a 300 page hard bound book becoming unruly at some point since all of the pages are bound in it.  It is a nice attempt at something very simple and since you write in one place things would not fall through the cracks.<br><br>Gerry</div>
