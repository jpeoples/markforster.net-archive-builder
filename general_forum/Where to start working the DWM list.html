<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-27 10:11</div>
<div class="content">Someone mentioned in a post that they always start working DWM from the point at which they'd left off, without paying special attention to the Today, Today + 7 or Today + 28 pages. This appealed to me, because I had been spending time reviewing those pages and didn’t like the jumping around. So lately I’ve been going straight to the leave-off point. Even dismissal is something I’ve been doing only when I've been round the list and got back to the top. Then I find that there are a lot of things up for the chop that I haven’t been attending to during their last days of life.<br><br>It’s occurred to me that this would be fine for someone who gets round their list quickly. My problem is that I get through the list terribly slowly - it takes me a week to get around a list that‘s currently of 102 items. (And that doesn’t include scheduled or time-sensitive items, which go into my calendar. I dare not entrust these to the DWM list.) I don’t get to see most of the items for long stretches.<br><br>If I add “Read through the list” as a task, it takes a week for that to come up. If I schedule the reading - oh bloody hell, that’s one more thing my calendar is nagging me to do. And I’m not going to put it into my precious Current Initiative slot at the beginning of the day.<br><br>It seems that for sluggards like me, starting at the top of the list is best, so that’s what I’m going to be trying from now.<br><br>I’d be interested in others’ experience.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">I should have made it clear that when I talk of starting working on the list, I mean starting at the beginning of the day; when I turn to the list during the day, of course I would go back to the point where I left off.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">How long would it take you to read through the list without interruptions and without stopping to do something that popped out?  Even with tasks on all 30 pages, that averages 3-4 items per page.  Could you read/skim through the entire list once or twice a day when you take a coffee break or waiting on hold  or some other mindless but time consuming moment?</div>

<div class="content">Chris. <br><br>I have the same issue. I am simply trying to go faster. Once a week is no-where near enough.<br><br>My approach is to set a really high hurdle the first time through. In the end, it doesn't matter if you get through without doing any tasks. This seems to work.</div>

<div class="content">Mark posted a tweak to take care of this: scan your list once and tag the items you will work on. That takes 30 mins. Next go through the list again looking only at the tagged items. Shouldn't take too long because you didn't select everything but just a few key items.   Mark suggested it as an occasional thing when you are in a tight schedule, but I imagine in could work if you take this approach repeatedly.</div>

<div class="content">I've been having the same problem (293 items currently -- way too many to cycle through every day).   <br><br>So I always start processing with "today".<br><br>(If anything has recently expired, I might start with those ones:  take a look to see what's falling off the list and deciding what to do about it.  But sometimes that's too distracting so I review quickly to see if there's anything that MUST be saved from those items, leave the rest for later processing, and jump straight to "today".)<br><br>If I am feeling disoriented I might take a quick trip through the whole list to get rid of already-completed or no-longer-relevant items; offload project-related odds and ends to a project folder; and to get a fresh picture of what else is there.</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>If it's taking you a week to get through a list of 120 items, you might as well forget about DWM and just work on the list in strict FIFO order.</div>

<div class="content">Chris, Seraphim- <br><br>Re-reading your messages, I'm curious about something in case we're using the same words for different things. What do you mean when you write thatyou 'cycle through the list'? To me (and for my reply earlier) that means reading through the list, not necessarily doing something on every page.</div>

<div class="content">To me, cycling through the list means going through each item, considering whether the item "stands out" / "feels ready to be done", taking action if so, skipping to the next item otherwise -- and getting through the entire list at least once in this manner.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - Indeed, when I have too many items on the first few days of my DWM list, I first quickly purge already-completed and now-irrelevant items, and then go through the list in order, working on each item, pretty much FIFO.<br><br>Once the crunch is over, I can revert to "work on whatever stands out".<br><br>The most useful thing about DWM for me is being able to effectively gauge how much work I really have, and how much I can really process.  I am still overcommitted, but DWM is helping me assess my progress in reducing the overcommitment, and helps point me to the areas that need fixing.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your comments, everyone.<br><br>I was always reluctant to set "read through DWM list" as a separate task, probably because I thought it spoiled the pristine purity of DWM in some way - I suppose I thought it should go onto the list as a task itself, where it would get lost in the queue. But clearly, I've got to establish the habit of continually reading through the list. I hope this will keep the list fresh, rather than being a menacing, haunted heap that I'm unwilling to look at.<br><br>I shall experiment in the next week or so - I now have "Work on getting through DWM list fast" set as my current initiative.<br><br>Including experimenting with marking items for action next time through. Which vulgar people call "setting pri*rities" (excuse my language).<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>> If it's taking you a week to get through a list of 120 items, you might as well forget about DWM and just work on the list in strict FIFO order.<br><br>Aargh! Don't consign me to outer darkness! I want to survive to see AF v99!<br><br>Actually, it's not just 120 items per week, since very many of these are repeated actions that are continually re-entered. And there's also my work-time DIT list. So the situation isn't quite as dire as that - but certainly I just plain don't get enough done. Or rather, I get too much of the wrong stuff, or the unchosen stuff, done.<br><br>That may not change, but I want to get DWM shining its light on what I'm doing and not doing.<br><br>Chris</div>
