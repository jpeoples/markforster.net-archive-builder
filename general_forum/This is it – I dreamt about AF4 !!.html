<div class="content">Such a nerd! I woke up testing variations of AF4 :-/<br><br>I know where it's coming from: I still can't deal with the anxiety of looping through the closed list, while there are potentially urgent items in the open one.<br><br>I know I was really more relaxed using AF2, even though I was neglecting older tasks.<br>So in dreams, after trying some more complicated stuff that I can't remember, I ended up doing "Reverse AF4", going backwards through the open list. After reaching the top of it, I would loop through the closed list, either forward as in AF4 or backwards, as in AF2. I guess the dismissing was performed using AF4's rules.<br>So simple. I think I'm going to try that.<br><br>Hm, I'm pretty sure that this was already discussed and some people are doing it.<br>Anyway, I just wanted to share that I dreamt about AutoFocus :-)</div>

<div class="content">You don't have to loop over and over if you're worried about your open list.  That worry gives you permission to say no to each task, and then you can look at your open list.  <br><br>Once you have gone over your open list, you can stop worrying because you now know whether you have important stuff there.  <br><br>Back in the closed list, you again have permission to say no to stuff if you know something important is in your open list.  Your only obligation is to scan the list, do one thing, scan again, do nothing, and move on.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan, <br><br>If I don't take action on anything on the first pass through the closed list, they are highlighted for dismissal...<br><br>I only want to reach the open list, but that doesn't mean that I don't want to do the tasks on the closed one (just not now!)</div>

<div class="content">I think you misread me.  I agree you are obliged to do something on that closed list. That something doesn't have to be much, and it doesn't need to finish a task.<br><br>Having said that, I see the value of switching to AF2 mode, as it will let you focus on a batch of urgent tasks for a while.</div>

<div class="content">I've been working like this today:<br><br>I started from the end of the open list and went backwards. After one pass over it, I switched to the closed list and worked in forward mode, looping through it as in AF4.<br><br>I didn't decide yet if I should start again from the end of the open list after nothing stands out, or keep doing pure AF4 (meaning that I'd only allow myself a single backwards pass at the beginning of the day)<br><br>It felt better and I was calmer. Contrary to what I thought, I did manage to get to the closed list after dealing with the urgent stuff, and perform several tasks.</div>
