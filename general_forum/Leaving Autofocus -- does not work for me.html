<div class="meta">2009-01-24 19:42</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>Well, I am thinking about ending my testing of AF.  While at first I thought it was working, now after two weeks, I am thinking it is time for me to move on to something else.  I have posted on here several times about my workload and tremendous project pressure.  I am a person that has the personality that likes structure and linear thinking.  This does not at all mean I am not creative -- I am a professor and scientist with two NIH grants and co-investigator on three other NIH grants.  With my heavy administrative responsibilities as well, I constantly face how to manage multiple projects and tasks in a linear fashion.  I am finding AF to fail me in this regard because I have so many things I put on the AF lists that stand out and are important AND I want to do that I find myself behind in many projects.  I need to plan out projects and have schedules of what things will be done this week, next week, etc. and schedule accordingly.  <br><br>My project plans in the past worked very well with the structure of DIT, which I loved.  I will freely admit here that I have been sad that DIT has been replaced and is no longer really supported here.<br><br>Therefore, it is time for me to bid everyone farewell.  I will either go back to DIT, GTD, or try out the structured system of Len Merson called the Instant Productivity Toolkit.<br><br>I wish all of you who seem to be almost passionate about AF and write incredible testimonials on how it has changed your lives all the best.  I certainly wish AF worked the same miracles for me.<br><br>Take care,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Many thanks for putting in so much effort to evaluating AF. I'm sorry it hasn't worked out for you, but it would be too much to hope that everyone would find it equally valuable.<br><br>One thing I would say is that DIT is still supported here, and any postings about it will receive as much consideration (from me anyway) as postings on AF. So please don't hold back on that account.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David,<br><br>I have also tried and not succeeded with AF, and have gone back to 'new' DIT (Do It Next Time).  I certainly will be hanging around here still!<br><br>I am a bit puzzled as to why AF failed for me, when everyone else seems to find it a roaring success.  I suspect that it may be because I am Dyslexic - by the time I have got to the bottom of the page with my first AF scan, I could have crossed an item off my list with DIT.  <br><br>The major reason I want to stay with new DIT is the 'am I keeping up with my workload?' measure.  I could always tell if I had taken on too much because it would take me more than 24hrs to complete a list.  If I had things right I would finish about one and a half lists a day, which said to me that all was well.  It also gave me no chance for procrastination, if it is on the list I do it.  So simple.<br><br>All the best, and thanks for the superb time management system Mark!<br><br>Bruce S</div>

<div class="content">David, before you go! I am heading a marketing organization in a startup and it is crazy workload. Most days I find plain Autofocus works great for me (in the last 2 weeks I have been working with it). Some days, like yesterday I found a combination of Autofocus and DIT to work very well. I have tried to explain this in the following post:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/640880" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/640880</a><br><br>On the days, when I need structure I create a closed list (DIT style) but from the Autofocus list. This has a dual effect of a structured day while making sure that there is no procrastination. Let me know if this helps in anyway.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Thanks for your kind words.  I have read the book by Len Merson and like his system.  If I try it out, I will let you know if it works well for me.<br><br>I think the only way Autofocus would ever work for me is that I would have to maintain two separate systems -- AF and then a deadline-driven system.  I may consider trying this as a new Beta system of my own creation and then let you know how it works.  Greenchutney, this may be similar to your hybrid of AF with DIT.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>It would be nice if you stick around the forum anyway as it's always good to read your thoughts and, as Mark said, it isn't just for Autofocus.<br><br>I can understand what you mean and I guess that in the instructions Mark says that Autofocus isn't for scheduled tasks. Maybe your way of project managment is more like how I do my studio work - I block out a set amount of time and then work 'off list' so to speak on whatever I'm progressing for that time. I do have a studio Autofocus list but only use it when I'm not in the middle of painting, etc.<br><br>So maybe Autofocus would work for you alongside scheduled blocks of project time. Perhaps some tasks for you would be more suited to the Autofocus approach while project work isn't.<br><br>Anyway, for what it's worth I appreciate hearing your responses as it makes me think about how I'm finding things too. I haven't been running Autofocus fully for a week or two since I've had a huge admin/financial task that has taken over recently. Now that's done I shall be going back to my list properly though.<br><br>Good luck with finding your own solution and do keep posting your thoughts - they're always good to read<br><br>Regards<br><br>Hannah</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>I don't know Len Merson's system so I can't give you any advice about implementing it. But one method you might try if it doesn't work out for you is prioritising by urgency only. This is a surprisingly effective way of organising work. <br><br>It does depend on your defining how urgent things actually are. That's easy for items with a deadline, but  just how urgent is an item like "Check email"? You have to define it, e.g. it must be cleared by the end of the day (or whatever).<br><br>Remember too that urgency relates to when you need to start working on something, not to when you are due to finish it, e.g. if you have two projects due in a week's time and Project A will take 2 days and Project B 3 days, then Project B is more urgent than Project A.</div>

<div class="content">It would drive me nuts too...  It's far too complicated for me, and that's not just because I don't even have a desk at work, and have very little discretionary time.  The system itself takes too much effort for my liking.  AF is much simpler.  (I'm not entirely succeeding with AF though, as I'm not going through all the pages because I have so little discretionary time at work.  When I do have a bit of time, I seem to just pick tasks from anywhere in the list that I think need doing, although that does include some tasks I've been stuck on for a while, so it's at least partially successful.)</div>

<div class="content">What Greenchutney said ;-))<br><br>You can make mini-AF lists from your AF list for particularly problematic days, and treat them as a closed list. <br><br>It works particularly well with tasks you are REALLY resisting as it removes the distraction of easier tasks you'd rather be doing.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-25 23:00</div>
<div class="content">I'm also with greenchutney. AF forms the "master list" that provides one place to enter tasks and review them. Often that's enough, but I regularly need to firewall projects and give them sole attention. The project goes in the diary as the focus for the day, the project tasks go on the tail end of the AF list, and I work from there and forget the rest. But when I surface, the AF list is there in its entirety to remind my of my wider obligations.</div>

<div class="content">I do not think Len Merson's system is that bad at all.  Granted, it is much more rigid in terms of the "task turtle", but it is very good from what I have read in terms of sequencing your tasks in a linear fashion -- one thing I have complained about with AF.<br><br>Mark, you yourself stated that if one has a lot of urgent tasks, then one could prioritize this way and by start date.  This is, in fact, the way Len describes his system.<br><br>But...am not sure I want my system to be TOO rigid...smiles...<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I have to say that reading the review on Len Merson's system would not encourage me to try it, not least because of the virtual in tray concept.  The thought of dealing with my own paper daily is fine but what aboout the stuff everyone else throws at you?  That would just panic me!  <br><br>I have been very fortunate with AF in that I can generally split my tasks down to small items and deal with them almost fully productively. It does take more time to fit in larger project type tasks and it sounds as if that is a very large part of your work.  You were also clearly a lot better at the discipline required for DIT than I was!  I think DIT is a fantastic system and was always frustrated that I could not keep to it as it clearly did keep everything on track. The fault was mine and not the system!  I certainly will continue to use a lot of the techniques from DIT, such as the concept of the current initiative and defining the backlog, within AF.<br><br>Do keep us posted as to how you get on - I've also enjoyed reading your posts.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>My understanding of Len Merson's system from Matthew Cornell's review (which is all I have to go on) is that the "Turtle Pile", or whatever it's called, is prioritised by importance not urgency. Did I get that wrong?<br><br>I have always had very grave reservations about the viability of prioritising by importance at the task level.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-26 10:19</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Life's grand goals come down to individual tasks and if you don't give those priority they don't get done ... an observation made by many time management texts (Laiken, Covey, Robbins ... just about all of them).  So if you are going to prioritize at all, don't you think that importance should play a big role?  (Else nothing but the unimportant but urgent things will ever be done.)<br><br>Personally, I block time for important things.  My task list is put aside when I work in those time blocks so nothing urgent is nagging at me.  If it is overwhelmingly urgent, I also don't use my task list ... I scrap my blocked time and just do the damn urgent task so I can get on with my life ;-)  Otherwise, it will have to wait until I'm finished with my time block.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I don't quite know how the Turtle pile works so perhaps I'm being unfair to the system, but the problem with prioritising by importance is that the real question is whether something needs to be done at all. If things of lesser importance don't get done because more important things are given priority then those less important things will either die or come back and bite you.If they didn't need to be done, then what are they doing on your list? (I'm talking in a business context here obviously).<br><br>So for instance, which is more important: a) running a sales drive, or b) sorting out the invoicing system? Most people would say a), but can your business survive if its invoicing system collapses under the weight of all the sales generated?<br><br>Which is more important? The engine in your car, or the rear window washer? Most people would say the engine, but how pleased is the customer going to be if you deliver the new car without the rear window washer she ordered?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Len Merson's idea of prioritizing on importance has urgency as a main variable within.  Every task has a start date and a completion date.  I agree with you about the concept of prioritizing on importance only.  That leads to the old ABC codes, with B and C items hardly ever getting done...and then coming back sooner or later to bite you in the butt!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I have certainly found that I have not actually missed anything urgent with AF but it is incredibly hard to let go of that feeling that we should prioritise the important items first.  I thinks Mark's comment above about the relative importance of items is a major key.  All I know is that for me, prioritising by importance did not work.  Whilst my backlog may have built up as a result of circumstances outside of my control, no system that required me to act consistently was working and I was in a constant state of firefighting and stress as a result.  I may have got things done but at what cost? <br><br>The irony is that people who don't know us well only see the things we do and view us as ultra efficient and having got it all together, and invariably pile more onto us as "we will always get it done!" Our family and closest friends however, particularly those who don't struggle in this area, view us with a mixture of pity, frustration, and downright bemusement.   <br><br>I really admire people that have the discipline to do what needs to be done apparently effortlessly.  Whilst I am sure we all know people who struggle with time management I am sure we all also know people who do seem to have the ability to "just do it!".  Whether my own struggles related to self esteem, perfectionism, attention deficit, procrastination or just that it was Monday was to a large extent irrelevant.  I could have got an Oscar for my headless chicken impersonation but all I know is that when AF came along I was desperate for a solution and three weeks on my hopes of an award at this years Oscars are fading fast! <br><br>Good luck David with finding what works best for you - that is after all the purpose of any system and I am sure your searching will lead to some excellent solutions.  Do keep us posted ....</div>

<div class="content">I have posted before about how to make sure AF includes the "important" items in terms of your goals. Simply make sure you are adding tasks related to your goals or add work on Goal #1, etc. I read Your Best Year Yet and created 10 goals for the year (I did this in August). Because I'm using ToodleDo for my AF lists, I have gone in and marked each task that applies to my goals. That didn't take long because most of my tasks aren't goal-related. That way I can see if I'm progressing on my goals or not. I think without goals, though, importance is just another pie in the sky. Even with them, importance isn't the key. Because "give dog a bath" isn't related to my goals, I shouldn't avoid doing it because right now she stinks. :-)</div>

<div class="content">I have to admit, although I do like this approach and very much like having everything on one list and I'm getting more done that I was before, I'm still having major (major) procrastination problems.  If there's something(s) I don't want to do and know I must, sometimes I won't even look at the list at all and will go on a surfing excursion instead.  Then I don't get anything done at all.</div>

<div class="content">Balfour,<br><br>Thank you for bringing this up. It is exactly the problem I am having (and have always had).<br><br>I am trying to get around it by putting absolutely everything on the list, including surfing, playing games, watching videos. Then I can't do these things until I get to them, which means doing at least a little bit of a task on each page up to the page with "Watch Battlestar Galactica ep.10" on it. It seems to be mostly working, but there is still some resistance to putting the pleasant task on the last page.<br><br>All the best,<br>Martyn</div>

<div class="content">What Mark is no doubt suggesting is that "Go surfing" can go at the end of the list and then wait there till the system brings it around again.<br><br>You see it would be a way of giving yourself permission to do it again soon but not just as an impulsive action in preference to other things that have a priority in the system.<br><br>That is one of the principles that was first introduced in DIT.  We avoid building up backlogs by making sure we do not spend most of our time on fresh things as soon as they come in or on things that are done without taking at least a short time to distance yourself from them before you can judge their true value for your life.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Balfour<br><br>One of the amazing things about AF is that it does enable us to identify what is really important in our lives.  By writing everything down without rationally qualifying it, or grading it as to it's importance, the system itself will bring us to a point where we have little choice but to question why we are not actioning specific tasks.  The reasons may not be as evident as we might initially think.<br><br>When I was really stressed my procrastination tool was the TV (too cold to surf here!).  For me my procrastinator was pure escapism but who knows - it may be that actually your hearts desire is to become a professional surfer and that practicing that skill it is not actually a procrastination tool after all .............<br><br>Once you start using the system and really get into it you may be amazed what starts to show up - it is just getting over that initial hurdle.<br><br>Best of luck!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I wonder how the job "professional websurfer" pays and where it is?<br><br>I'm on the internet for my job a lot.  Maybe the solution is to think of websurfing as my job, since then I'd probably avoid it, and then I'd get other stuff done.  <br><br>That's helpful Christine.  Yesterday, I finally cleared off the number one item on my lists that had been lingering.  Seeing it over and over, in your face, does make you consider it.  If you look at the lists.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Balfour<br><br>You've shattered my illusions - there I was imagining you hot-footing it off down to the beach!  Now that really shows how effective AF is for me - I would naturally have equated surfing with the web in my pre-AF days.  Now life's just a beach! :-)<br><br>Interesting comment you made above though - "Maybe the solution is to think of websurfing as my job, since then I'd probably avoid it" It sounds as though there is some resistance around the the whole "job" scenario - something to consider perhaps?  Whilst every job has it's degree of tedium I am a great believer in the fact that we should be working at something we enjoy.  I know jobs are an iffy subject in the present climate but life's too short to waste our talents being miserable.<br><br>Now, professional websurfer, let's think about that one........... ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi David <br><br>This thread has meandered a long way from your original farewell.  I rarely contribute to forums but I am moved to comment this time because I  am disappointed that you seem to be saying a farewell to the forum rather than just to AF.  I have found your comments, and Mark's answers to you very  interesting and helpful.  This was particularly so when dealing with projects using DIT.  I have smiled on many occasions when you appeared to highlight a discrepancy or inconsistency in one of Mark's answers only to be amazed as Mark patiently pointed out that there was no discrepancy. <br><br>For me AF appears to be a major step forward. It has not opened a whole new world as seems to be the case for many who comment on the forum. I am not dancing through my work with gay abandon, nor are my customers dancing in the street, but I am improving. I still have many outstanding projects and more overdue work than I care to admit to, but AF is helping.  The most suprising thing  for me is that I like looking at my lists rather than avoiding them.  Crossing off tasks either completed or at least started has been a great motivator.  It is a bigger draw than many of the time wasting antics I practised before AF.  Small steps are rewarded and there is no feeling of failure at a half completed list at the end of the day as was the case with DIT. The realisation that carrying out the smallest task on a project is better than doing nothing at all has finally struck home. The fact that everything is listed and that all projects are reviewed regularly is a major advantage for me.  I have to block off time to try and finish urgent tasks that are urgent only  because they have been ignored for so long, but there is still  time on most days to check the lists and make some small progress on other projects and tasks.  Hopefully there will be less urgent tasks in the future.<br><br>Mark, thank you for the chance to try AF, and David  please keep a note to follow this forum in whichever system you decide to use.  Why not go back to DIT that seemed to work for you and many others?<br></div>
