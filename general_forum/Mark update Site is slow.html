<div class="content">Hi Folks. Are any of you in touch with Mark? I haven't seen him post in a while and wonder how he's doing... what he's working on, etc. <br><br>Also, this site seems to be running sluggish on my end. At times, it even times-out. I don't have this issue with any other site.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I would like to hear about any news about Mark Forster, too. <br>I am also timed out sometimes when trying to access this site.</div>

<div class="content">I also haven't heard anything and see the site performance issues and timeouts.</div>

<div class="content">The site is running on an old version of Squarespace (v5?) and Mark has said in the past he has no plans to upgrade the site to the current version of SS. So that is causing a few performance issues we'll have to live with. <br><br>Relatedly: I have been saving favorite posts and threads to my Pinboard; i pay extra to create an archive of the pages I pin. God forbid this site goes down, but if it did, there are too many wonderful discussions and posts that I do not want to lose. (I'm going back and re-reading the No-List posts now, and some of Mark's old blog posts from the 2000s. Good stuff!)<br><br>I think it's possible to send web pages to archive.org? This site and Mark's writings are such a great resource, it would be a shame to not be able to access them.</div>

<div class="content">Has anyone tried to email him?<br>When was the last time he posted on the forum? The last blog entry was in November 2024.<br>I went back and saw he replied to one of my posts in September of 2024.<br>There was a thread celebrating his 80th birthday in November, 2023.<br>There was a blog entry called "Future Developments" where he announced that he had officially retired at 65, and that was in the year 2008. He definitely was busy posting on this site after that. Although he has not been posting as frequently lately, there are many of his former posts that are still relevant. I appreciate how much he answered and addressed the smallest question about how to work a list.</div>

<div class="content">I am connected with him on Facebook. His last post there was about a month ago. Usually about this time, he announces the Lenten Challenge.  Since he hasn't posted that or anything else, I am getting kind of worried about him.  I'll ping him and see if he responds.</div>

<div class="content">I just sent him an email, informing him about this thread, and that several of us are interested in any news that he would like to share.</div>

<div class="content">No response on Facebook, so I also just sent him an email.</div>

<div class="content">Lent starts with Ash Wednesday, which is next Wednesday, March 5. <br>Today is March 1. <br>No notice yet about the Lenten Challenge.</div>

<div class="content">I have not received a response from Mark Forster to the email that I sent to him on February 25.<br>I sent him another email today just now at the the email address given on this forum.<br>He has not responded to this thread as yet.<br>I assuming that no one has heard from him.<br>I am visiting this site every day to see if there is any news.<br>In the last 7 or 8 years he has initiated a Lenten Challenge, but tomorrow is the start of Lent, and he has not done it as yet.<br>His participation on the website has tapered off in the last few months, and we probably have noticed it. Over the years, he answered even the smallest detail, so I think it is likely that he must have more pressing matters at this point in this life. Yet, I think we all would like to hear from him.<br><br>Does anyone have any suggestions of how we could proceed?</div>

<div class="content"><<Does anyone have any suggestions of how we could proceed?>><br><br>This is the only website I’ve consistently visited and participated in since the mid-2000s. Because of that, I feel like I’ve gotten to know some of you (especially Mark) which creates a sort of emotional bond, even though we’ve never met. So naturally, Mark’s absence concerns me, which is why I originally asked about him.<br><br>That said, whatever is going on re: personal, medical, I respect that it’s Mark’s private matter. Until I hear otherwise, I’ll leave it at that. I do appreciate those of you who have reached out to check in on him. Thank you.</div>

<div class="content">I haven't received any replies either.  I reached out to his daughter on Facebook, will let you all know if she responds.  My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family!  I hope he is doing OK.</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if we should start a Discord channel as a backup. Many of us share a similar passion for personal systems that blend creativity with productivity. I would hate to lose this wonderful community if the site ever experiences extended downtime. Mark has created something truly valuable here, and I'm grateful for all his contributions over the years.<br><br>To be clear, I'm not suggesting we replace this forum, but rather create a contingency plan to maintain our connections.<br><br>Mark, if you're reading this, please let us know if such an idea would not be welcome. For everyone else, I'd appreciate your thoughts on this suggestion.</div>

<div class="content">Nico, <br><br>I think a contigency plan would be a good idea. <br>Perhaps someone with expertise in this matter could advise.</div>

<div class="content">Mark's daughter kindly posted a comment on the video I did on Re-zero https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNcf3cyXakI <br><br>Sadly she reports Mark has been unwell lately. I have replied wishing him well.</div>

<div class="content">That's too bad about Mark. He's been a great inspiration for me.<br><br>I see there's already a Discord group, so will delete my offer to help and join that one.</div>

<div class="content">I noticed today on a Ben Vallack video on youtube "This Time Management System Changed My Life", that Mark's son had commented 4 days ago that his Dad has not been very well lately, but that he would be thrilled that Ben had made this video. <br>Ben replied "Many thanks for commenting. I'm very sorry to hear this; I'm certain I speak for all of his community in wishing him well"<br>The video was about ReZero,</div>

<div class="content">Apologies<br>1. It was Mark's daughter that had commented<br>2. That Ben had already mentioned it above.<br>Smeatho feels foolish and wishes Mark well.<br>Grateful to Mark for all his work and to Ben for his excellent videos.</div>
