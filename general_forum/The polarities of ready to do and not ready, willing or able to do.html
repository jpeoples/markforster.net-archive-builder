<div class="content">This seems like a suitable myth for the power of the unconscious:<br><br>"Aphrodite dumped a huge pile of many types of seeds into a great heap, and ordered Psyche to separate them and sort them into piles by individual type. This had to be finished by sundown. Psyche knew this was impossible. But soon a big army of ants arrived, and scurrying back and forth, completed this task after all! Aphrodite was infuriated when she came back to find this task done, and determined to make the next one even harder."</div>

<div class="content">Aphrodite brought a monkey, who started multiple fires that prohibited the ants from ever getting close to the seeds.<br><br>Psyche was once again stumped.</div>

<div class="content">And Psyche named the monkey "Chaos" and gave it to Netflix, who used it to make their systems anti-fragile. Aphrodite thwarted again. <br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Monkey" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Monkey</a><br><a href="http://principlesofchaos.org/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://principlesofchaos.org/</a></div>
