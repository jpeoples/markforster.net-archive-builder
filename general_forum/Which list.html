<div class="content">I've realised that there is ambiguity the instruction "Cross the item off the list, and re-enter it at the end of the list if you haven't finished it"<br><br>I've been putting it at the end of my long multi-page list, consistent with the idea that, though it might be spread over several pages, there is only one list.  "The system consists of one long list of everything."<br><br>The problem with doing this is that an item at the start of a 100-item list will be reentered 100 items further down, whereas an item near the end of such a list will reentered just a few items further down, and revisited almost immediately.  <br><br>An alternative approach is to reenter the item on the same page as it is already written.  This is consistent with "You work through the list one page at a time ".  It doesn't suffer from the shortcoming just identified.  It also avoids lots of page flipping, and where a task is done a little bit at a time the fact will be obvious as the one page will have it crossed out and rewritten repeatedly.  The downside is that one might run out of room on a given page. <br><br>Which approach did you have in mind?</div>

<div class="content">Take a look at Mark's comments at the bottom of:<br><a href="../blog/The First Day of the New System!.html" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/1/6/the-first-day-of-the-new-system.html</a><br><br>He re-enters the item at the end of the list, even if he is currently at the end of the list. This provides an excuse to keep recycling a task item (in between others on the final page) if you feel so inclined.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Frank is right. The re-entry goes at the end of the whole list. This may be 100 items down the line, but once you get there and work on the item again the re-entry will probably be much closer, so it will average out.<br><br>If you put the item on the same page, and then move onto the next page, the re-entry is still 100 items away, so I don't see the advantage.</div>

<div class="content">I can imagine there's also an advantage, in terms of the subconscious/intuitive processing aspects of AutoFocus, to reshuffling items so they show up grouped with a different set of tasks from time to time.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, eurobubba, this reshuffling definitely contributes to keeping the resistance to doing tasks down. <br><br>I can certainly feel at times some resistance starting to build when there's a page with a number of "tough" tasks on it. Just by doing a bit on one (or a few) of them, and sprinkling those tasks among other pages seems to "freshen" things up again, and often changes the feeling of the original page.</div>
