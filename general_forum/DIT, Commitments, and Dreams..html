<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>Presently I have my 4 or 5 Commitments written down seperately in a file that I review weekly when I sit down to plan out the main events of the upcoming week. I have also just started reading 'Dreams' and have an initial idea that I will probably use my Vision to communicate my Commitments. I would be interested in hearing how others approach writing down and reviewing Commitments in terms of frequency and level of depth. For example, do people out there actually write down what they are *not* going to do as part of a Commitment, or is it more intuitive, making an individual evaluation of potential incoming tasks? I would also be interested to hear if others feel that the 'Dreams' approach is compatible with DIT. I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be, although my initial concern with the Dreams approach is that I am not sure I currently have the time to Commit to (pun intended) daily writing sessions.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>It seems to me that DIT and the Dreams approach are fairly clearly incompatible in certain central respects. <br><br>On the Dreams approach, you're aiming to be in "Pull Mode", and once you are, you do whatever you feel like doing at any given moment. If you feel resistance to doing something, then you might explore what message your mind might be trying to send via that resistance during your daily dialogue with your future self, but the basic idea seems nonetheless to be that if you feel resistance to doing something, you don't do it. <br><br>In DIT, however, the aim is do whatever's on your will-do list each day, whether you feel like it or not. If you feel resistance to doing something on the list, then you try various techniques for working around that resistance (e.g., the "I won't really..., I'll just..." trick, or working in timed bursts). Admittedly, the idea does seem to be that by applying the DIT approach you'll reduce the amount of resistance you feel in general (because you'll get a lot of energy just from being on top of things, knowing that you can complete each day's work, and so on), and there's complete freedom to do the items on your will-do list in whatever order you like; nonetheless, the general principles governing what you end up doing each day are clearly quite different.<br><br>Given that the two approaches are incompatible (which is not to say that you can't take *elements* of one and incorporate them into the other, of course), a natural next question is which approach to adopt. There's some discussion of that issue in this thread:<br><br><a href="../general_forum/Dreams vs. DIT.html" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/514307</a><br><br>Of course, all of this should be preceded by a big "As far as I understand the two approaches...."<br><br>Best,<br><br>Martin</div>

<div class="content">Hi Martin, thanks very much for your views. I see what you mean when you mention the differences between push mode and pull mode. I wonder if writing a Vision (to use within DIT) would give me greater focus and take me out of 'Drift' mode? I don't think I would last too long in my job before sinking without DIT!  <br><br>Mark, would you possibly able to provide insights into how you currently clarify / identify your Commitments? And / or do you follow the 'Dreams' Approach rather than / in addition to DIT?<br><br>Thanks,</div>

<div class="content">Well, currently I'm working on updating some of the ideas in Get Everything Done so I'm not using either DIT or Dreams. However the two methods are not intended to be used in conjunction. Indeed it would be impossible because Dreams involves following your feelings moment by moment while DIT involves working from a list of tasks. That's not to say that you can't use some of the ideas in both, by my recommendation is that both work best in "pure" form.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for the clarification Mark. I think I will stick with DIT as it's working very well for me at the moment. I think I will do some focused work on a couple of the principles in DIT - having a clear vision and the section on Commitments. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">I'm very interested in this thread as I find I have a tendency to fall somewhere between the two approaches by natural inclination. If I use the Dreams approach after a while I tend to drift - with a lack of structure and going by how I feel I find that I don't get much done but for much of the time I feel more relaxed about life in general.<br><br>Conversely, with the more structured approach I get on well for a while then somehow lose momentum and seem to almost subliminally 'rebel' against the structure and not get things done or wish for less structure. On the face of it the two approaches - push mode and pull mode - do seem incompatible since they require opposite ways of working. Yet there is something that appeals about both systems and so I wondered if anyone has any bright ideas about how someone who doesn't like too much structure but drifts with too little can make sense of it all and develop a system that works?! Any and all ideas welcome.<br><br>As a slight aside but still relevant, I am self employed - running my own gardening business - and a non-selling artist (I'm in a development phase not an exhibiting phase at present). When I was employed I was very good at keeping on top of my work life using a reporter's notebook as an ongoing to do list with regular reviews throughout the day. I also had various other methods for keeping on top of tasks that worked well in the customer support role I was in (batching tasks, etc). However, my domestic arrangements were never as well organised and this was where I had, and still do have, a tendency to drift. Urgent things get taken care of because they're urgent; important but non urgent things don't always get done; and  I am a good time keeper with appointments, etc. So I am a bit of a mix between organised and drifting! Therefore I would be interested in anyone else's thoughts on this.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Hannah,<br><br>I seem to experience resistance to the DIT approach / structured time management systems if I am overwhelmed with tasks and / or I am making little progress if my energy / motivation is low. However, 99% of the time I am all for the structure because I like to feel upto date in my work with the bonus of knowing when I have achieved my day's work. It's in my nature to 'push myself', and this is the way I tend to approach my tasks and projects. I would really struggle in a purely 'pull' mode. I like the idea of developing a clear vision  though as I think this can help with focus and minimize drifting. <br><br>In your case perhaps you could have a Clear Vision that is revised periodically, which I believe you can use with either method, and maybe give yourself a 1 day 'DIT holiday' once a week or equivilent to be as unstructured as you like (Or would that just be imposing a further structure!)  <br><br>In summing up, I think I have pretty much got the action part of DIT nailed, but I have not really cracked a 'higher level' of planning (as per the related principles in the text like having a clear vision and deciding what one's commitments are) and I would be inspired to hear of other people's techniques that work for them.</div>
