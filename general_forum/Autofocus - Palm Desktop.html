<div class="content">I believe the palm pilot desktop will work for this - if you enter each task as with a priority of 1 they seem to stay in order and my screen has 26 of them showing . . .<br><br>Will try for a few days and see<br></div>

<div class="content">FL Mark,<br>I looked at Palm Desktop and couldn't figure out how to "highlight" with this system.  You can cross things off by marking them as complete. But how do you mark things as "dismissed" where you would highlight them?<br><br>As I said in another thread.  I opted to use Google Notebook.  I'll be interested to see what you come up with.<br><br>Thanks,<br>A fellow Palm user.</div>

<div class="content">Remember that the point of highlighting an item is so that you can easily review dismissed items. So you could transfer dismissed items to a separate list, which would achieve much the same.</div>

<div class="content">Yes - I have a "someday maybe list in my palm directory - I'd just put these there - works a treat for those items you are not ready to commit to ditching forever . . .</div>

<div class="content">Just a thought on this.  I have a separate someday list.  It's pretty big.  I'm thinking this system might help me action that "someday backlog".  I'll have to decide that I'm either going to start moving toward completing that book or stop spending the mental energy to tell myself that someday I'm going to write that book.  Forgive myself, and move on to being productive in what I AM going to do with my life.<br><br>Does that make sense?  If it can't boil up enough to get my attention in my autofocus list - am I just playing a game with fooling myself that I'm going to someday take action?<br><br>And if I really want to give that a second chance.  I can set an appointment 6 months away to reintroduce it into my list.  But I really want to cut myself loose of dreams that are just crowding my brain and I'm not really going to act on.<br><br>For this purpose the autofocus list becomes a bit of a "tell yourself the truth" sieve.<br><br>I think that's part of the point of the system - it brings focus to the things to do without pressuring - auto... focus...</div>

<div class="content">Mark FL, Michael, <br><br>if you still want to use Palm Desktop, you might be interested in my latest post concerning using a Palm for AF:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/673409" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/673409</a> <br><br>Since Palm Desktop mimicks the functionality of the Palm handheld, you could use the same setup in Palm Desktop. However, it can't filter by priority (AFAIK), only by category, but that will suffice if you move dismissed items to a 'Someday' (or 'Dismissed') category (unless you want to delete them right away, of course). You can then regularly filter out that category and only view (only) that category to review the dismissed items.</div>

<div class="content">I don't like the idea of moving them to a separate list.  That creates a new task:  review "dismissed" list.</div>

<div class="content">Zack:<br><br>Well, technically you work only on the still active pages of your autofocus list, while all dismissed items are on inactive pages, so you'd need that "review dismissed tasks" task even if you keep dismissed items in the af list.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-24 0:32</div>
<div class="content">But I agree that you should have as little organizational overhead as possible.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>Yeah, but the dismissed tasks are right there in your notebook. The review is as simple as flipping through the book.  I beelive that's why they are highlighten...the review occurs immediately as you flip through to find your current page. i think the strength of the sstem is that it eliminates all the "Now I will sit down and do my daily review" ramp-up stuff.</div>

<div class="content">Zack<br><br>You are right that the highlighting of the dismissed items enables them to be reviewed at a glance.  It is also a reason why adding any different highlighting to other items is not recommended as it detracts from that effect.  If you are likely to forget to review those items regularly then the "review dismissed items" option is a good memory jogger.</div>

<div class="content">Dismissed to someday/maybe:  Remember, you really should be doing a weekly review.  That is not something invented by GtD that has to be ditched because we all now hate GtD ;-)<br><br>Reviews are something I was doing on a weekly basis before David Allen even thought of GtD.  Seriously, a couple of hours each weekend to set up next week and align your goals and review your projects is all to the good.<br><br>So both ideas accomplish the same thing ... change the category to "someday" and it vanishes (to be seen only when you select that category) or copy it to a new list.  It all works ;-)<br><br>I'd like the idea of using simple native Palm applications (if I used my Palm any more) but realize that any data base or spreadsheet or list management program would also work ... but then there is the temptation to make it do strange things ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I did a test today and found that you can do everything you want with Tasks on the Palm.  <br><br>- Forget priority as it defaults to 1 and it would be a pain to change it each entry<br>- Use one Category for your main list and another for Someday and ... well, whatever<br>- Tick it off and either leave it there or have it hide<br>- Use notes for extensive additional information<br>- Put in a page marker every 30 entries or so<br>- Add a date when you think appropriate and it sorts to the top ... pretty nice.<br>- Set an alarm if you like.<br><br>One small hitch is in the transfer from Desktop (where it is easy to do some power typing) to the Palm some (a very small percentage of my test data)  of the items picked up a date, yet showed no date when I tried to change it.  I had to change the date to a different date then change it to no date ... then they went to the end of the list.  HUH?  Well, no real problem ... it looks as if I worked on those items -- I got a freebee  ;-)<br><br>It looks as though it might be a fiddly system given that the support for Palm is almost non existent.<br><br>Of course, the downside is still that it is slower to get out the Palm, power it on, write in the entry, etc.  It is faster to whip out the notepad ;-)  And there is still the risk of failure unless everything is backed up.</div>
