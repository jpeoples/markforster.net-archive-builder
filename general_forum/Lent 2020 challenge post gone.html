<div class="content">I can't find the link to the lent challenge for 2020.  I'd like to signup.  Just in case it doesn't come back, this is my system:<br><br>Discretionary time at work and home: simple scanning (using one notebook).<br>Also, I feel that it is absolutely crucial for me to also use Stop Work on Everything Else Times (SWEET) to remind me to stop working my lists.  <br><br>I feel it is important to note that there is a large part of my day that is not discretionary while at home, when my kids are awake.  90% of that time is spent caring for them, but I have a few spare moments to do other things while they are awake.  Therefore, while my kids are awake and during the 10% free time, I'm giving myself the permission to do whatever I feel like I can do during that time.  The time windows are so small that alternating between simple scanning and interruptions just isn't worth it <br><br>In summary:<br>Simple Scanning and SWEETs during discretionary time<br>(And anything I feel like doing when kids are awake, and I'm at home with them.)</div>

<div class="content">If I try to open the URL of the 2020 lenten challenge post, I get a login page, instead of a "page not found" error like I get if I try to open a made-up URL. So my guess is the post was set from public to private either accidentally or on purpose, not deleted.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the thread!<br><br>I was just looking for the blog post to sign up for the Lenten Challenge.I choose to use a different system at work and in my private life:<br><br>- Mark Forster's Reverse AF2 experiment for work: I have a lot of different projects to do at work and wildly fluctuating schedules (very structured days interspersed with stretches of unpredictable work loads). <br>I used to add my Todos in my regular journal. During weeks where I had a lot of control over my time I would have a nice todo list to work from, but during busy weeks the list was interspersed with lots of notes spread over a lot of pages; I couldn't find a good way to use a journal with a long list in a way that went well. Inspired by the "Simple Scanning" method I bought a separate notebook just for my tasks. I've been using this only for a couple of weeks, but I like it a lot so far. It's very simple to use and I feel on top of my work despite the large amount of tasks on it. The list did get longer though, so I though that I would like to try Mark's idea of alternating the direction of the scanning <br><br>- The No-List system from "Secrets of Productive People" for my private life: I have a lot of different hobbies and the big goal of becoming self-employed this year. The No-List system sounds appealing because it is simple and helps me to focus on the few things that matter. I tend to over-estimate the amount of things I can do in my spare time.</div>

<div class="content">Whoops!<br><br>Sorry about that. I re-dated the post to keep it at the top of the pile and forgot to re-tick the "publish" box. And of course I didn't notice the mistake, because being signed in I could see the post myself.<br><br>My apologies.</div>
