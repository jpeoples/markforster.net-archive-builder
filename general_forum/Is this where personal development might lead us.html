<div class="content"><a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/domination-submission-workshop/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.stevepavlina.com/domination-submission-workshop/</a><br><br>I was quite fan of him. I started my personal development journey from his articles on time management, early waking up, purpose and goals, then Gtd and Mark Forster systems. But he went into path that didn't get my attention NLP and whole pick-up artist scam.I unsubscribed when he emphasized that one partner type of personality is limited and he advocated polyamorous as true way of development. <br><br>I was searching his site for old articles on purpose soul search and found this workshop, I hoped that it was Easter Egg, but there are to many signup details and even price. He also shut down his forums.<br><br>Just wanted to share, if this is inappropriate, please delete this topic Mark.</div>

<div class="content">As I guessed, it was a joke. Click on the register button to see for yourself. <br><br>Having said that, it's only half joking as evidenced by the number of articles on the subject. As for whether D/s is tied to time management, I guess it's more linked to the Believe In YOU power trip kind of stuff that Steve likes.</div>

<div class="content">Then he got me hehe! But based on his other ideas I would not be surprised if someday he will run one :)</div>

<div class="content">I think it's a feeler - in fact he makes it pretty clear that it is. He is certainly into that sort of thing. I think I unsubscribed and removed his blog from my blog list about the same time that Navigare unsubscribed.</div>
