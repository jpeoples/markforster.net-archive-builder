<div class="content">One of the differences between the first two no-list systems, SMEMA and 3T, was that one was to be fed with tasks from a longer feeder list, while the other explicitly shouldn't.<br><br>Later, during the course of publishing one of the best book on time management "Secrets of Productive People" by Mark Forster there was talk about a list of commitments, that is how it was called in the book, or a list of authorized projects, that's how it was called sometimes on this forum.<br><br>The idea was that you would only be allowed to work on projects that are on that list, using your no-list system.<br><br>Now my question is what specifically is the difference between the two types of list ("feeder" and "commitments")?<br><br>My second question is, how would working with a commitments list and a no-list system together work? In terms of when specifically would I take a look at the commitments list, if filling in tasks into the no-list system is to be done out of my mind?</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>I suggest you read my answers in the current thread "How to Handle Reminders in No List Systems". What I say about clients can equally well be applied to commitments.</div>

For example, I work with a Scrum team on a software development project. We follow the Scrum methodology, so our team commitments are spelled out very clearly:  we have a specific list of work items that must be completed in our current sprint. So, as part of my daily routine, I check the sprint status every day and see how things are tracking, and see if I have any specific work items that need to be addressed. We also discuss this in our daily standup meeting: what did we get done, what are we working on now, and what are the blocking issues. This is part of the structure and routine of my day. When I am sitting at my desk and ready to work, the work that needs to be done naturally comes to mind, because it's fresh from these daily reviews and meetings.  If I have a nagging feeling that I need to do something, but can't remember exaclty what I am supposed to do, then I put "Rally" on my no-list (Rally is the system we are using to track all our work items for this project). And I go look at Rally. From this review, I see what I need to do, so I write those things on my no-list: "Get the issue resolved with XYZ" or whatever. And I go work on that. Generally, once I get going, I just "follow the work", pausing to think and reflect about what needs to happen next, and if I need to, I just go back and look at Rally.<br><br>Another (maybe obvious) example is my calendar. It's full of the commitments I've made in the form of agreeing to meet with other people. I review it in the morning (as part of my daily routine), and make note of any final preparations I need to make. Those things go on my no-list. When the time for the meeting arrives, that pops up in Outlook and on my phone, and I attend the meeting. No need to write that on the no-list. As the meeting progresses, I capture notes and action items, and store them in OneNote. When I have free time, those action items often come to mind by themselves, so I write them on my no-list, and get them done, referring back to my notes as needed. I also review all outstanding meeting notes as part of my daily routine, and if I see any action items that need done, I put them on my no-list and get them done.<br><br>Anyway, the pattern here is:<br>- I have other systems for handling the details of these commitments (calendar, OneNote, Rally, etc.)<br>- Reviewing those systems is part of my daily routines and checklists<br>- Often the work comes to mind by itself (goes straight onto the no-list). Or nagging feelings prompt me to review those systems ("review system" goes onto the no-list). The daily routines ensure that they don't get missed. <br>- Most things just get done by following the natural course of the work (by working in no-list mode)<br><br>I hope that gives you some ideas.</div>
