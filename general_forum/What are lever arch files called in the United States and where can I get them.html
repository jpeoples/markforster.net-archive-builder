<div class="content">In Do It Tomorrow  Mark recommends "lever arch files" for filing. I don't think this term is used in the U.S. but the product should be available there. <br><br>Any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">It's kind of funny to see this going in the other direction for a while - usually on the web you see Europeans trying to get their hands on US-style manila folders to get away from lever arch files because David Allen told them so. ;-)<br><br>I recently decided to do all my filing digitally by scanning all documents with my scansnap document scanner and archiving the originals simply by date. But I guess that's not for everyone.</div>

<div class="content">What is the superior filing system- "Mark Forster lever arch files" or "David Allen US-style manila folders"?  I am using the manila folders and do not want to switch over unless there is a clear advantage.<br><br>Regarding digital scanning-  I am surprised more people haven't thought about taking their notes using a digital notepad such as Acecad Digimemo by Solidtek.  That way all handwritten notes can go directly onto your computer.<br><br>However, I am not thrilled with  Acecad Digimemo by Solidtek because it uses wireless technology and I am concerned about the potential health hazards of wireless technology.<br><br>Does anyone know of a comparable device that does NOT use wireless technology?<br><br>Regarding scanning- my scanner is very slow. Can anyone recommend a "high-speed" and efficient scanner?</div>

<div class="content">I think there is nothing wrong with the US-style 3 hole system, if a good punch is available. Only the occasional adding of  small sheets is a little more difficult. Technically, I expect the punch holes to be larger than with a 2 hole system,  but I was never able to check if this is true. <br><br>As Andreas says, the only true orthodoxy is manilla folders :) That's why I was not saved.</div>

<div class="content">Mark T, I Missed the mail<br><br>For scanning Andreas mentions the Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners (25ppm), if you can pay it.<br><br>For a digital pen IRISnotes can also work in wireless mode.  But overall I think that Acecad Digimemo has a lower level of energy than IRISnotes in continuous mode</div>

<div class="content">The portable version of the Fujitsu ScanSnap is the S300 and S300M (for the Mac). Tiny and super fast--the best scanner I've ever used. I have one at school/my studio and one at home and got rid of tons of paper files by digitizing anything worth looking at again. I use Yep, which I think is Mac only, to organize my pdfs. <br><br>Now, my paper files are mostly "temporary" project files and when the project's done, they get stripped and recycled. I swear by clear plastic document files (open on two sides) with custom color-coded cover sheets.<br><br>Circa rings +  ScanSnap scanner +  Brother labeler = filing and organizational Nirvana.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your suggestion on the portable scanner. <br><br>Please provide me with a link that shows where I can purchase "clear plastic document files (open on two sides) with custom color-coded cover sheets."<br><br>Photos would be useful also.</div>

<div class="content">Here's a link to the clear plastic folders (open on two sides):<br><br><a href="http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/741341/Office-Depot-Brand-Poly-Project-Files/" rel="nofollow">http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/741341/Office-Depot-Brand-Poly-Project-Files/</a><br><br>I have been using them for a couple months now and they really do make a difference.  Much easier to sort and handle than manilla folders, for me anyway.  I am able to retain a much clearer picture of my projects (literally!).<br><br>Magazine holders work well with these, to group related folders / projects as needed.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Liz I. or anyone else who knows,<br><br>What are the advantages of "Circa rings" and where do you recommend I get them?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mike. Now I can make and informed decision about my use of Circa rings.</div>

<div class="content">For those who are scanning everything in that sounds great but how are you then organizing it on the computer and how do you back up.  I would be afraid of a hard drive crash.</div>

<div class="content">Larry G:<br><br>I have my ScanSnap S300 setup so that when I press its button, it scans the papers in the tray, saves them as PDF in a directory on my harddrive *and* adds them to my Evernote account. Evernote does excellent text recognition (if you have a premium account, 45$ per year), so I can just search for anything and find the corresponding pdf. So I have my documents searchable in Evernote, backed up on a server and the original scan on a local harddrive. <br><br>I file all papers except stuff I need frequently in folders labeled "year-month", for example "2009-12". If I need a receipt or a bill, I search it in Evernote, look at the date and know in which folder its in. Once a year I archive the folders from the year before last into archive boxes. Since those are labeled "year-month -- year-month" I can still find stuff fast if I need a older document.<br><br>That system might not be perfect, but it moves very  smooth for me, much better than my old alphanumerical sorted category system.</div>

<div class="content">How many scans per minute can you do with the ScanSnap S300?<br>Can you scan pages from a book with this scanner? I have a traditional flat bed scanner. It is very slow but gets the job done. Does the ScanSnap S300 replace it completely?</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-12-13 0:43</div>
<div class="content">The speed varies from 8 pages per minute to 0.5 pages per minute , depending on quality settings and color mode (you can scan both sides of a paper at once, so you can double these numbers in that case). I only scan photographs in high quality and resolution, normal documents go through really quick. <br><br>The ScanSnap S300 is a small, portable scanner, it's designed for holding 10 sheets at once - though you can refill while it's scanning and it will all go into the same pdf. If you need more speed and volume, you'll have to pay up for a S500 which holds 50 sheets and scans max. 20 sheets/40 pages per minute.<br><br>All sheet-fed scanners can of course not scan books, so you'll still need a flatbed if you do that a lot. I use my scansnap to scan photographs, but a flatbed would probably get better results. But if you need a scanner for your documents, the speed improvement is tremendous. Just press a button an your multi-page, two-sided contract becomes a single, auto-cropped, auto-rotated, searchable PDF. If I had to scan my documents with a flatbed, I wouldn't do it at all.</div>
