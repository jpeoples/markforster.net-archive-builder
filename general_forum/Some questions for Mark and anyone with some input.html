<div class="content">I have read DIT three times now and have been very surprised by the great results I have been having!<br><br>I have three questions that have been in the back of my mind since I started the processes, I was hoping for a reply from Mark or anyone that has some input.<br><br>1. How do you handle Home tasks? I like to batch my tasks, but sometimes when I get home from work I am not in a home task kind of mood. One solution that I had was to forward these tasks in my task diary to Saturday when I know that I will have loads of free time. <br>2. Projects. Can someone explain to me how DIT gives projects a “stake in the ground”? I believe that the solution to this would be to make sure I carry tasks forward in my task diary when writing my next days closed list, but I would like to hear some thoughts on this.<br>3. And most importantly! In the task diary, do you cross out, check off, or highlight completed tasks?<br><br><br>Thanks!<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik,<br><br>Re 2. Although I find DIT a fantastic System I have really struggled with tracking my Projects, in the GTD sense of having a "stake in the ground". I am currently trialling having 2 sheets of paper stapled together that I re-circulate daily through my in-tray and 'will-do tray'. On the first sheet I list the Outcomes I want from the active projects that I have. On the second sheet I list 'Potential Organizational Projects'. I suppose the second sheet is similar to the GTD Someday/Maybe concept but I tend to keep this list as realistic as possible and in line with my existing Commitments. These are Pojects that I will do, in order. <br><br>As Mark has commented, Organizational Projects (these do not have a deadline) are really best done one at a time if possible as taking on too many projects of this nature is likey to lead to Overwhelm. So this basically means that on my first sheet of paper I list the Outcomes I've set for myself that relate to Deadlined Projects, Continuous Projects and ONE Organizational Project. In fact I really like Mark's identification of different types of projects (see related articles on this site) as it seems logical and more realistic in terms of time available.<br><br>I circulate this list through my Tray so that I get to read my Project Outcomes daily and list related actions in my Task Diary. On a related point I often do not write in Next Actions nowadays but just write '30 mins on X project' as I often find the Next Action concept a little stiffling. <br><br>Re 3. I like to score out my completed task items with a red pen!<br><br>Please do let me know if any of this does not seem clear, or if you have any ideas you could share. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Erik:<br><br>Leon has done a very good job of answering your query, so I will confine myself to a few additional points:<br><br>1) The work/home divide is always a difficult one, and comes up in many different forms for different people. My general advice is to have a separate Will Do list for each location. As someone who works from home, I therefore have one Will Do list which covers everything. However for personal tasks, I only ever put "chores" on the list, e.g. paying bills, mowing the lawn, cleaning the car. I don't include leisure activities - I don't want to spend my entire free time ticking items off a list - it's good to have some free-ranging time in which I simply do what I feel like doing.<br><br>2) There are many possible ways of handling projects in DIT. It's important to pick the ways that fit the individual project and which suit you. I tend to recycle the project through my Task Diary on a daily basis when it is "live", i.e. put "Project X" as a task and do whatever needs doing on it. That sounds similar to what Leon is doing. Once the project goes quiet I will schedule a Review in my Task Diary for an appropriate period in the future, e.g. one week, one month.<br><br>3) Personally I cross items out, which gives a great sense of satisfaction. It also gives a sense of achievement at the end of the day to see all those crossed out items!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your positive comments Mark. <br><br>Erik, I forgot to mention that I have Trays at Home and at Work and therefore an 'Active Projects' and an 'Organizational Projects Waiting List' for each location. I tend to process my Home Tray in the evenings and list tasks for 'tomorrow' as mornings at home tend to be a bit hectic! I process my Office Tray first thing in the morning (as messages accumilate for me late afternoon and evening from the previous day in my job) and list my days work before closing off the list.<br><br>To echo Mark, it may be best to make adjustments (to managing your pojects) that work best for you.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, Leon, first of all, thank you for your generous and prompt responses. <br><br>Leon: I like your idea of briefing yourself with a circulating outcomes/future lists daily so you have the stake in the ground.<br><br>I can certainly relate to your note about “stifling” next actions. They can tend to get too granular and not give as much payback as “30 min on Project X” can give you. Which is a great plus for DIT. Focus on outcomes-direct daily to actions.<br><br>I also liked your idea of home/work trays. I do have in-trays at home, but I don’t think the DIT A-Tray, B-Tray system would work too well for me personally. I think I may be just too lazy at home to have much processing power.<br>Thanks for the input.<br><br>Mark, great suggestions on the will do lists for each location. I have routines at both home and at work. Some of the things at home in my task diary nag at me. A true life example is “go through and decide to fix or throw out old/broken coffee maker.” This has been forwarded 3 times in my task diary now. Due to time or other things that ended up taking priority (like the Presidential Debates in the US!). I really don’t know if any system can help me here. Perhaps I just need to fool the reactive mind and break the task down in to something achievable and small.<br><br>I appreciate both of your comments on project tracking. Since using DIT I have cut my active projects list WAY DOWN. Now my shortlist of projects do indeed seem to be getting done much quicker. I think for now I will try a hybrid of circulating a list (which is more like a commitment backlog) through my in-tray until I get the list done.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi, Erik<br><br>You could always try the old stand-by: "I'm not really going to deal with the coffee maker now, but I'll just get it out of the closet".</div>
