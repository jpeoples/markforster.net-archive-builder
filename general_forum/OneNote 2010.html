<div class="content">Looks like MS is going to add quite a few nice things to the new OneNote.  I do hope they fix the printing ;-)  But many of the items on the list are things I wish were in there now.  (Like better page creation!)<br><br>We can only hope that it does not start crashing once it comes out ... but what are the odds?  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">As a longtime onenote user, I tried the canvas program.   Neat idea, really buggy and not ready for primetime.   I uninstalled within an hour of playing.<br><br>re new features that are long overdue:<br><br>* collapse sub page groups<br>* basic styles - hmm, I hope this means paragraph formatting like double-spacing, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Having played around with Canvas I love it BUT as tb says it needs a lot more stability.  What it is really useful for though is using it for a quick scan of information in notebooks (downside you can only work on one at a time) especially if, like me, you have a lot of information you have printed to ON that you want to sort.</div>

<div class="content">Just installed the 2010 office preview with onenote and the collapsable subpages is nice.  Styles do not look changable yet and the paragraph spacing icon is grayed out.   Hopefully those last 2 items will work before the final version is released.</div>

<div class="content">Agreed.  I have not uninstalled yet simply because I don't want to risk another crash!  LOL ;-)  But it is a great idea.  Also the new feature (promised) of a more complete smart phone application.  YAY!</div>
