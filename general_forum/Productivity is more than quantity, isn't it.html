<div class="content">What is "more productive"? Is it number of tasks? Number of goals? Quality of goals? Quality of me? My happiness and contentedness? The positive effects I have on others?<br><br>Rather like "success" it seems that "productivity" is in the eye of the beholder. So it seems to me that it helps to have a personal definition of "improved productivity" before we set goals for the year.<br><br>I suppose for some people here there is just an issue of sheer quantity of things that are imposed or demanded by others or the organisation. Productivity is then just dealing (coping) with what comes at you.<br><br>Being happy all day and getting nothing done is productive, isn't it? Doing less and being happier (so making better quality decisions I hope) might be part of my "productivity" for the year ahead.</div>

<div class="content">Define productivity by the cumulative value of the things produced. Define things broadly. Now define value.</div>

<div class="content">Some days I get a lot done and don't feel productive, yet others I get less done (and sometimes less important things done) and feel like I've been productive.  <br><br>I think it has to do with whether a day goes better than envisioned or worse.  Sometimes it's how some obstacle or distraction that popped up is handled.  <br><br>It's likely that the answer to this will be different for all of us.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br><< Being happy all day and getting nothing done is productive, isn't it? >><br><br>Maybe for the one day. <br><br>But after a week of getting nothing done both the happiness and the sense of productivity have usually vanished in my experience.</div>

<div class="content">Yesterday, my wife and I spent all night putting up paintings, building a bookshelf, etc for my new office. At appx 11:30PM, I stepped back, surveyed the work, and thought: "You did it man... you did it!". <br><br>A day/night well lived. <br><br>The components:<br><br>1. A vision<br>2. Taking on fear<br>3. Support (my wife)<br>4. Hard work<br><br>Sprinkles of scaffolding i.e. Omnifocus, bit of this or that system etc, helped as well.</div>

<div class="content">In answer to michael's original question I would suggest the answer might have something to do with producing things in which we can take pleasure.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< I stepped back, surveyed the work, and thought: "You did it man... you did it!". >><br><br>A very good example of what I've just said.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: I agree with your sentiment. I think I'm clearer about what I want from a system of productivity / time management. It isn't for - for me - quantity. It's more like a feeling of accomplishment. And I agree that 1 day on a beach can be productive, but I believe not many people want to lay on a beach for several days. Equally, long periods of busyness can be tiring without fulfillment or accomplishment.<br><br>Sometimes we need exertion and a challenge to get the feeling of having "overcome" and knowing our own strength or ability. I also want it to include "expression" of my abilities. Productivity for me will be a varying mix of creating peace and contentment with accomplishing (external) things that have meaning and value for me. My 2012 future vision (in the sense of "Dreams") will capture that intention.<br><br>One reason our personal definition of "productive|" matters I think is because as the Dalai Lama says: “The nature of our motivation determines the character of our work.” A peaceful mind is also more likely to make better decisions about what has value, and what activities to commit to.</div>

<div class="content">Michael, <br>interesting thoughts. As I understand productivity, it is active PRODUCTION of important things in my life. Things which I value and consider important. It can be in the form of tasks, results, but also new/good experiences, times well/valuably spent etc. I would not expand this term any further. As I see it, productivity is not and should not be the only life goal. There should also be important goals like happiness, satisfaction, living in harmony with one's values and views, love, giving, self-actualization, self-knowledge, knowledge, wisdom, balance etc etc. For many of them, productivity is good predisposition, but the relation does not always have to be tight, especially when productivity is measured by inner satisfaction with results (E.g. I have read interesting story about Da Vinci who allegedly suffered by terrible feelings of guilt because of his self-perceived unproductivity (sic!)) <br><br>I do not think that for many <<people here there is JUST an issue of sheer quantity of things that are imposed or demanded by others or the organisation.>> (my emph.) I doubt that such people are so interested in self-development that they would devote their time to this forum...</div>
