<div class="content">Mark, I am intrigued by the filing system you describe in DIT, but am hampered by the fact that I am in the States, and you were apparently addressing mostly a British audience in your book.  I had never heard of "lever arch" files until you mentioned them.  I found some on the internet (non-American sites), but none of the sites had very good pictures of exactly what they look like and how they work.  Any ideas of where I can get a very good picture/description of them?  Or better yet, is there a pretty good American equivalent that you know of?  (I would like to avoid importing filing supplies from Europe!)<br>Thanks very much!</div>

<div class="content">I think the American term is a three-ring binder, though European models have two (or rarely four) rings.</div>
