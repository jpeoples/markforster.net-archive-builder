<div class="content">I would like  to change a bad habit using AF. I think someone mentioned something about in this forum. I also want  to incorporate new habits ( that is easier). Anyway, I opened this topic to discuss how far AF can help besides actions and tasks. Does anyone have an experience?<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Silvia<br><br>That's a great question and I think will generate a lot of interest.  There are a number of techniques that can be used to break habits but which generally require a considerable degree of discipline.  It strikes me that AF should be able to get us to, perhaps a different solution.<br><br>As for a practical example on procrastination- a very bad habit ;-) I think we can all see how AF is helping to deal with that but by eliminating the need.  More difficult when we are confronted with a "procrastinator" when we are not in AF mode so to speak.  Today, after lunch when returning to my lists I saw something that needed to be done - it wouldn't have taken long but I knew I would then "just do" something else and so on, leaving me with the feeling that I had wasted time.  The answer was of course to write the task on the list - it will get done at some point. It was easy to use AF to break that habit - because I had already seen the benefits.  The real key to breaking a habit is by identifying the benefit to breaking that habit and focusing on that rather than the habit itself.  <br><br>Maybe a starting point could be as simple as a task "look at ways to break habit x" and allowing AF to start a process.  If we accept that the best way to change a habit is not to struggle with "I must change x habit" but to replace it with an alternative, then perhaps adding the replacement to the list.<br><br>That's a very brief summary but perhaps food for thought ......<br></div>

<div class="content">Silvia:<br><br>I haven't tried this out but it struck me that using reverse psychology with AF might work. Say for example that one wants to break oneself of the habit of drinking too much coffee. Put "drink coffee" on the list and only allow yourself to drink coffee when the item "stands out". <br><br>My guess is that this might actually result in "drink coffee" eventually getting dismissed. Like I say, I haven't tried it. Since I don't drink coffee, I'd better find another bad habit to try it out with - hmmm let's see...</div>

<div class="content">The next habit I want to form is to drop the slogan<br>"Protect the trustworthiness of your Autofocus list. <br>Don't put unreliable reminders on your list."<br>on every appropriate and unappropriate occasion.<br></div>

<div class="content">I am doing interesting things on my notebook, 26 pages plus the new ones. The new ones, separated from AF (but in the same notebook) are the following:<br>- errands<br>- new habits <br>- AF best moments<br><br>New habits - these are in general not correction to bad habits but new things I want to do on a regular basis<br> <br>AF best moments<br>I add the best moments of  my using AF. I did not look to this page for a while and then,  when I looked at it I remember things and "momentum" I would otherwise forget about. And to revise them was so encouraging, indeed. I will keep this list.<br><br>Now, for the bad habit I am using the positive approach, and almost everyday I write something to help me change  what is the biggest hindrance in my life, or as Jinny Ditzler says, "How do I limit myself?"<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Silvia,<br><br>I would argue that one cannot really "break a bad habit", so much as "develop a better replacement habit".  Trying to NOT do something is a bit like trying to prove a negative -- negatives don't exist in nature ... they are only the absence of positives.<br><br>So first pick a replacement habit.  Using Mark's example, don't try to not drink coffee, but instead decide that you will drink tea instead.  Then link the urge to drink coffee to the act of drinking tea.  Lay out the tea supplies.  Put away the coffee supplies.  Define times that you will drink and enjoy tea (but see later on linkage).  When you stop for a tea break, savor the tea ... relax and enjoy it ... take time to day dream or do something pleasant while you are drinking your tea.<br><br>Get the idea?<br><br>Now sometimes (often, actually) one has the problem of going on autopilot and being well into a cup of coffee before one realizes and remembers that one wants to stop that and drink tea instead.  That is natural.  That is what habits are all about.  So just pour the coffee out, making as big a deal about it as possible, and drink your tea instead.<br><br>There are other techniques which help and support habit changing, but the essentials are:<br><br>- Think about why you want to stop (lots of BIG reasons)<br>- Think about why you want to do the substitute thing (lots of BIG reasons)<br>- Link the urge to do the first to actually doing the second<br>- Allow no exceptions for at least a month<br>- While you are changing over, luxuriate ;-) in the new action<br>- After a month, forget about it and move on with your life ... you'll have a new habit.<br><br>Mark's suggestion works, but is more applicable to things that seem outside of your conscious control -- like where you can't get to sleep or sleep through the night.  In such cases, it is helpful to make a rule that you stay up for two hours and don't go to sleep no matter what.  You will, of course, become tired and by fighting to stay away, you set up a tension where your subconscious mind rebels and damn well forces you to go to sleep.  For a habit where you can consciously change the action, I'd use the more conventional approach.<br><br>Oh, and think about the kind of habit you are trying to change.  Most habits are linked to something so putting them on a list to pop up randomly is not likely to help much.  You'll be apt to drink a cup of coffee before you ever stumble across "drink tea" on your list.  In addition, often drinking tea is not something that you do randomly.  Here in the U.S. we have "coffee breaks", meaning "work breaks", really. And hourly workers don't usually drink anything until those times so the AF list won't help.  (But then they are probably not likely to be using AF in the first place ;-)<br><br>In any case, you don't simply want to drink tea, you want to drink tea INSTEAD of coffee so you need to link the URGE to drink coffee with the ACT of drinking tea.  So arbitrarily drinking a cup of tea is not going to get you far.  It will help, no doubt, but you still will need to focus on the urge.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Silvia<br><br>Mike's given some excellent tips there.  It does of course depend on the habit you are trying to break as to how you would apply it but as Mike says a major key is to concentrate on the benefits that removing that habit will bring.  The more you focus on the habit itself the bigger it becomes in your mind.<br><br>If I were to say to you "Whatever you do don't think about a pink elephant" you would try very hard but you would really be fighting not to watch an entire herd of pink elephants galloping across the prairie.  If, however I asked you to think about a blue mouse, not only would that be so much easier but the pink elephants would just disappear over the horizon.<br><br>A lot of the most successful diet methods work by focusing not on a diet or lists of "forbidden" foods (which of course you immediately crave) but on intensely building up a picture in your mind based on the reasons for that weight loss desire, i.e. health, fitness, different clothes etc.<br><br>One of the things we find when we are stressed and overwhlemed by our "stuff" is that our minds are so clogged up that it's a case of "well, I just can't think about that now" or "I'm not in the right frame of mind".  With the way that AF frees our minds to such an extent I think that it will be a lot easier to address such issues, and that we can use some of our "thinking time" task to look at the best ways for us.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I've found that certain habits, such as web surfing, TV, email chatter, just all disappear.  I usually gravitate towards things like that when I'm feeling unsure of where to start with my "real" work.  With AF it's always very clear where to start, and easy to get going, and I have found that I just haven't been doing the empty bad habits nearly as much.</div>
