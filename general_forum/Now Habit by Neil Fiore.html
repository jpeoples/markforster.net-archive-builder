<div class="content">Does anyone know if The Now Habit is a fully-fledged system you can use, like DIT or GTD, or is it just literally offering advice on overcoming procrastination?<br><br>I am using Mark's DIT at the moment but have heard some interesting things about TNH...</div>

<div class="content">Simon,<br><br>Google for Neil Fiore detailed book summary. (Summary by Xavier Noria).<br><br>IMO,<br>1) It is very, very good book - as you can see from user reviews and ratings on Amazon. <br>2) Mainly it deals with thinking style, not task or time management and it differs in that from DIT or GTD.<br>3) His book "Stronger self" if much weaker and I don't recommend it. <br>4) If you're interested in thinking style, mind traps, acceptance and commitment (which Neil discusses a lot) you may find very interesting to take a look at "Get out of your mind and into your life". It is extremely helpful and funny book about thinking styles, values, goals and commitment. You can browse thru it at Google books.</div>

<div class="content">Try it an see. I very much enjoyed reading The Now Habit and found that it just did not help me at all.<br><br>Mark's Do It Tomorrow, on the other hand, helped me enormously from the very first time I used it. <br><br>Just off the top of my head, one thing both books have in common is the use of a kind of "reverse psychology." Fiore has you block out all the times when you commit yourself to NOT WORKING. It's all very clever. You know that you will have time devoted to not working, so that when you are working you won't be anxious that your leisure needs will go unmet.<br><br>Forster's reverse psychology can be found in some of the self-talk he suggests we use. "I won't write the XYZ report, I'll just open the folder and take out the paper." Forster has me tell myself that I am not going to work on some overwhelming project, I'll just do a simple physical task.<br><br>Like I said, DIT worked for me and The Now Habit did not. Different strokes for different folks.</div>

<div class="content">I read the Now Habit and liked the idea of having times available for yourself which makes work less overwhelming to some and allows them to work versus procrastinate during set times.  As far as processing of tasks, I agree a simple system like DIT or AF will be better for most who don't want to put tasks into a schedule.  A simple way to combine these two methods is to block time for processing of your time management stuff and then have a block of time for personal stuff.  I think I included this concept in the first ebook which can be grabbed for free at the link below. <br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry, is is possible to use your system 'The Ultra Simple Guide to Time Management' in conjunction with TNH?</div>

<div class="content">Simon H,<br><br>Yes you could certainly do that.  I think the best way would be to time block and work your TM activities into the unschedule.  So working through your USGTM notepad would be a block and other blocks would be personal type things.  This method would work for any TM system in my opinion.  My take on the Now Habit is to allow one to see that there is in fact time for personal and fun stuff so they do not feel overwhelmed and when it is time to work they work knowing they will have an end time and be able to do the fun stuff.  <br><br>Simon are you using USGTM and if so how is it going?<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry, I have just been looking at different systems and trying to work out which best to use, I do like Mark's DIT but your USGTM does look fairly easy-to-understand too.<br><br>My biggest issue is procrastination hence me trying to combine a method with TNH...</div>

<div class="content">After getting completely overwhelmed with DWM I switched to USTM. It solved some procrastination issues that were mostly related to the fact that I have countless ideas I don't take action immediately, but let them simmer for weeks or even months until I find a solution I really like (implementing the solution is usually a matter of days). With USTM, these ideas don't have to be rescued from getting dismissed, on the contrary, they are reviewed on a regular basis - which led to amazing results in the last two months (the last system I used unchanged for more than two months was AF4 - with at least as many pages as I currently have in USTM - one could argue that I have put too much in AF4 - but then again, this would have led to a whole bunch of systems for capturing, reviewing, procrastinating, ...).<br><br>(sorry, not quite a response to Simon's question ... But yet another example where solving the underlying problem solved some of my procrastination issues. Many thanks to Gerry for the wonderful system!)<br><br>Lazy Cat, currently procrastinating on the decision whether another roundtrip to the store would make sense ...</div>

<div class="content">Lazy Cat,<br><br>Thanks for the nice review.  Are you using the SGTM the first ebook or the USGTM which is the second?  <br><br>I am glad you are finding the system helpful.  For those that want the system(s) they are free on my blog.  They are both paper based and require only a spiral notebook or legal pad of paper.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry: I use SGTM (oups, I thought it was USGTM) - but based on a DIN A6 ring binder instead of a spiral notebook (because I don't want to have empty pages and that way I can add new pages whenever I need them - and DIN A6 is _very_ portable).</div>

<div class="content">Was browsing a bookshop, and came upon this book. Bought it. The introduction is certainly promising. Will read more. ;-)</div>
