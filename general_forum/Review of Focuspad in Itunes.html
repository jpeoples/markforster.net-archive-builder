<div class="content">I give up.  I  wrote one review on Itunes for Focuspad.   After 2 days, I noticed that Itunes didn't post it.  So I wrote another one yesterday morning.  Still no post.  <br><br>Has anyone else had this problem?</div>

<div class="content">Jonlat, I posted one last night and it's there today!  My first ever review!  I had tried to post one a day or so earlier using the iphone (!) but that didn't work as the system didn't accept the name I chose, for some reason.  As it was my first review, I don't have much else to add about what to do/ not do, but good luck anyway.</div>
