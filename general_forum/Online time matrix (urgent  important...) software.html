<div class="content">I've got an online time management system that uses quadrants to divide your tasks --- the whole urgent vs not urgent, important vs not important idea.  Surprisingly I'm enjoying eating my own dogfood, and thought I'd share.  Looking for feedback.<br><br><a href="http://quadtask.com" rel="nofollow">http://quadtask.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Eating your own dogfood?  <br><br>The implementation is great, the only thing I noticed was that when I was using Firefox the labeling of the 4 quadrants is cut off.</div>

<div class="content">"Eating my own dog food" in the sense that I wrote the software, and am actually *using* it myself, not just trying to get others to use it :)<br><br>Which version of Firefox / OS caused the labels to be cut off?  Are the labels truncated regardless of browser size?  It seems to work (for me) with Firefox / OS X, XP / IE7 and XP / Chrome.<br><br>Thanks for taking a look.</div>

<div class="content">Firefox 3.0.14 causes truncation no matter what I do.  Works fine in Chrome.</div>

<div class="content">As long as we're talking about quadrant models, don't forget David Allen's perspective/control model, and Ken Blanchard's must/want model (see <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/2/15/the-four-quadrants-a-different-version.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/2/15/the-four-quadrants-a-different-version.html</a><br><br>for Mark's explanation of the latter).</div>
