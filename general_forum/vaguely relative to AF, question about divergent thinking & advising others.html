<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-8 20:56</div>
<div class="content">I've noticed there are quite a few people on the forum that do consulting or work creatively, so I thought my question might get some helpful feedback here.<br><br>I've been bumping into something and I'd love to hear some feedback...I'm a divergent thinker and do really well thinking up many solutions to a single problem. I can think of a myriad ideas to approach any given situation, in the box, outside the box, you name it. All a person needs to do is say "I'd like this and I'd like that" And an endless stream of ideas will come pouring out. Especially if the criteria aren't fine tuned. <br><br>What I've noticed is that when it comes down to advising or consulting or simply communicating ideas, is that...<br><br>well I need to stick with just one approach, idea or strategy otherwise the person or group hearing it doesn't quite take it in & act on it. So I sometimes wonder if being a dominantly divergent thinker can be actually a disadvantage if besides just giving advice, you need to give a person or project specific direction. <br><br>Having many ideas as a modus operandi can sometimes stand in the way, because there's often a self belief that tells you any of the ideas will work. That makes it hard to 'reject' all the other ideas in favour of another. Especially if the criteria are complex. But I know advisors are usually packed with ideas, it's their job. What are some good tips on applying divergent thinking and directive guidance in situations where you are called upon to advise and guide?<br><br>Another thing I've noticed is that is psychologically almost hard just to communicate one idea if you have many, because it feels like you're holding back or not showing your full knowledge. At the other end of the coin it's easy to overwhelm people with ideas when what they need is a simple 'next-to' action. <br><br>While writing this I just realized an inverse AF approach might work with this. Writing down x amount of ideas and picking out one stand out idea to implement. If the idea is rejected, strike it out and continue the list and pick the next stand out idea. Hmm<br><br>Brainstorming goes AF?<br><br>My other question is if an 'idea' person is well suited to direct others to begin with, or is this an uphill battle/mismatch? What do you think?<br> <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter<br><br>A very interesting question!  My personal view for what it is worth is that when looking at a "problem" sometimes there will be a myriad of ideas, thoughts, solutions that come to mind and sometimes just one or two.  Although the ideas may feel random to a degree they will normally be the product of two things - (1) your own expertise and experience, and (2) the information you have been given.  As a general rule, if you have been engaged in any form of consultancy you will have sufficient experience to identify a number of solutions and have developed the expertise to recognise and tailor them to the situation.<br><br>The critical factor is actually the information you have been given.  The less information you have been given the more ideas you are likely to have because the actual scope of the project has not been narrowed sufficiently to identify the "best action/s".<br><br>In many cases the person asking for your advice often does not actually know what they need or needs something other than what they are asking for.  A lot of marketing will suggest you should give the client what they want - the only way to satisfy a client is to not to give them what they want but rather what they need and that is where it is important to recognise the difference.  Sometimes, if you can see that a client is asking for something that is not what they need, yet they continue to insist on what they want, you just have to walk away from the situation.<br><br>It is hard sometimes to hold back when you believe you can see the answer but it is important not to just jump in, for a number of reasons.  To be honest that is a whole subject in itself but in my opinion, offering a few suggestions to the party concerned will normally be sufficient to start reducing the options and to begin to identify the best option.  Intuition actually plays a large part in the process - people want to be able to see the benefits for themselves and can be overwhelmed with too many ideas - or feel stupid if something seems obvious to the other party and they have not thought of it - and intuition plays an important part in when to say something and when not to say something.  As I say there are almost as many factors as your "endless stream of ideas", and I could probably write all day on this :-) (Don't worry, I won't :-)  big sighs of relief from all those fed up of reading my voluminous posts!)<br><br>To answer your last question, yes I do believe an "idea" person can direct others BUT those ideas need to be tailored to the clients' needs (not wants) and not be influenced by what the consultant thinks is a good idea just because it's his or her idea.   <br><br>Just my 2 pence worth!</div>

<div class="content">I was actually hoping for a voluminous post by you Moneypenny!<br><br>You actually hit the nail on the head with giving people what they need versus what they want. That can be a very tricky thing.<br><br>If the person you are advising has ideas of there own and they've gone to you to help them figure out the hows, it can result in some friction. <br><br>Like for instance a client wants to be famous and asks for advice on how to get a particular song to make it big in the music charts. <br><br>You'd be paid to advise on how to get that song in the charts, which you do have ideas for but you know it's not the best avenue. The trick is knowing that you'd be better off consulting on achieving the real goal (being famous in this case)with more effective approaches. <br><br>But this is where cognitive dissonance occurs because sometime if you let the client know that they'd be better off using a different avenue, they will tune you out (as if you can't do it). They already have a certain way of thinking laid out on how to achieve their goal. So when you divert them they feel like you don't know how to do it, leaving you look incompetent. Besides you want to do what you're hired for. The alternative is working with the criteria the client had intended, but that can feel like you're being incompetent as well because you're going about something in a less effective way. Then if things don't work out well, you are to blame for not guiding the right course of action to begin with.<br><br>I guess the only remedy is to not work with clients that aren't flexible in their thinking. But you usually don't find out until after you've committed to them. <br><br>To get back to my original question, do convergent thinkers work well as advisors. From what you're saying yes, but there is an amount of experience and training involved. <br><br>I rather like my inverted AF approach to picking out the right options. Putting that into practice.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">oops, that's the only thing I miss in the forum...the ability to edit for grammar and other mistakes...<br><br>"do convergent thinkers work well as advisors" should read "divergent thinkers (idea people)"<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter<br>LOL!  Don't worry.....we already knew that.  The context allowed us to edit it........I rely heavily on this.  I write my posts extemporaneously and without a spell checker.  I'am taking a lot on faith that the actual message is silted through the horrible grammer, spelling and sometimes even going off track a bit!  LOL!<br>Yes....you guessed it....I'm also a divergent thinker.  I believe that convergent thinkers prize this trait because it facilitates both problem solving and novel thinking.  ahem....Mark Forster is advising us and I seriously suspect that he, too, is a divergent thinker!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter<br><br>Thanks for the compliment!  This is actually a really big subject and the points you raise have a lot of connotations.  The difficulty is that, as a consultant, you are expected to "consult" on the area that you have been appointed to consult on.  Whilst that sounds like stating the obvious very obviously, in my opinion, to be a good consultant you HAVE to go that step further and look outside the box at the overall situation. If you are consulted to "do x", the client needs "x" and you "do x" you will be considered to be a good consultant. If you are consulted to "do x", but the client needs "y" and you "do x" you will be considered to be a bad consultant because you can bet your bottom dollar that it will be you that gets the blame for "x" not working.  If you are consulted to "do x", the client needs "y" and you recognise that the client needs "y", then you need to find a way to tell the client.  If they insist on "x" your best option is to walk away.  If you continue to "do x" you will be considered to be a bad consultant.  If you do walk away they may consider you are "not up to the job" or just plain arrogant, but if they are that intransigent they will eventually find their desired "bad" consultant to do the job they want and it will be that consultant who will be blamed when it doesn't work.<br><br>There are a number of issues here, mainly around self belief.  If the client is intransigent it is often because they have a self belief issue and cannot accept that they could be wrong.  If they are not able or willing to look at options then I would strongly recommend walking away, because if anything goes wrong it will always be seen by them to be your fault!  The other thing to be careful of is that their insecurity can inadvertently trigger any doubts you may have yourself.  If you strongly believe you are correct and the client says otherwise, by all means re-examine the options but ultimately you will "know" the correct approach.  Regardless of whether the client thinks you are incompetent or not does not change the facts.  If you are competent you are competent.  Learn to recognise that knowledge of being correct, not in an "I am the consultant therefore I am right" way but in the knowledge that you are competent in this scenario.  Don't assume the client is always right!<br><br>You are correct in that sometimes you don't find out these problems until after you are committed.  The best scenario is where you can enable the client to see that a change to specification is better in as non-threatening way to the client as possible.  Unfortunately there are occasions where you are committed and the client's level of insecurity is such that, not only will they not admit the possibility of being wrong, but will go to almost ludicrously extreme lengths to prove they are right.  Inevitably a win-win scenario becomes almost impossible to achieve and you are into the "minimise a lose-lose scenario".<br><br>The practical solution is unfortunately difficult and probably requires putting in writing why you are unhappy with the proposed course of action detailing specifically where you believe things can go wrong and requesting the client to specifically instruct you to do it "their way". The problem with the situation reaching that point, is that that course of action will inevitably create resentment (arising from fear) and create a pretty toxic working relationship.  Whilst best advice is not to get to that point that is not always possible,<br><br>The example you detail above is a very good example of the type of scenario that can run into those sort of difficulties, because the desire for fame is so often linked to a desire for acceptance arising out of a lack of self acceptance.  You only have to look at some of the reputations of those who are famous - there are those who take all the advice they can get from their "consultants" and there are those who are known as the most difficult people in the industry to get on with or work for.  Is the prestige of working for the second worth the exchange of the real job satisfaction and enjoyment you would get from helping those who will really benefit from your expertise?<br><br>At the end of the day I get a lot of satisfaction from knowing I have really helped to resolve a problem for a client.  Yes, I have experienced those "toxic client" scenarios, which are painful and to be honest are demoralising, because I guess we all want to be able to help everyone, but I find that, in my own experience the overwhelming feeling is not anger, or even a feeling of failure, but a sadness that the person themselves will most likely continue to experience problems.  Walking away can be costly but not walking away can be worse!<br><br>As to the AF approach for ideas, well that is an interesting thought! :-)  My belief is that a lot of consultancy has to work on an intuitive level, not necessarily in the "nuts and bolts" of resultant actions, but in finding that "correct" approach.  As I believe that any approach needs to be tailored to fit (the client, the situation, the level of the problem, corporate requirements etc etc etc) a rigid approach is unlikely to identify anything other than what has been tried before.  Given the intuitive nature of AF I can see no reason why the system should not work well - but that is, at this stage, purely hypothetical! <br><br>There you are Peter, another lengthy post for your collection! :-) <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thank You Christine!<br><br>It is an indepth subject when you get down to it. These were really useful points worth reviewing regularly. I think the one epiphany a consultant can have is that it's okay to waive a client that isn't compatible. Especially in toxic working relationships, giving up and letting a client walk because you know you could just as easily be working with the ideal client. That is, if business is good.<br><br>One of the thoughts that came up while reading your post is another issue of feelings of responsibility. But I'm going to crystalise those thoughts before posting. Basically it's about how an advisor feels responsible for the implementation of ideas...and the more involved the advisor is with the implementation/directing process, the more sense of responsibility there is. The more likely there is to be a discomfortable working relationship. <br><br>more later...<br><br>thnx Moneypenny!</div>

<div class="content">You're welcome Peter!<br><br>Responsibility is a whole other issue!  But to refer to your comment "if business is good" -financial considerations are an inevitable factor but when finance becomes the primary motivator quality can be adversely affected.  I think if the consultant is good - and works on developing quality - then business will follow, even when times are bad.</div>

<div class="content">One of the reasons for Toyota's huge success over the decades is the process that they have developed to meet their customers' requirements with as much efficiency and flexibility and as little waste (in several categories) as possible.<br><br>One of the tools that they use for problem solving, idea development and communication is something called "A3".   The idea is that it should be possible to document the root cause,  the analysis,  the solution and the plan for executing that solution on a single piece of A3 paper.      The key thing is not the size of the paper but that it should be a tool to assist the thinking and collaboration process.    There are a lot of links out there about the whole 'lean' thing and the A3 stuff;  here is a link for a starter  <a href="http://www.lean.org/events/oct_webinar_mtl_pt1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lean.org/events/oct_webinar_mtl_pt1.html</a> <br><br>Dave</div>
