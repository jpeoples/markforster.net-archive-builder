<div class="content">Hello and happy new year everyone!<br><br>As we wait with bated breath for mark to release the rules on his new way to do HITM, I thought it may be interesting to see how others are managing their time and tasks as we begin 2018.<br><br>Some may recall I had been doing what I called "Random RAF," which was just using the randomizer per Mark's rules and doing a DDD for each task that came up. i did that until Mark talked more about simple scanning...<br><br>Now I do a combo of "Simple Scanning" and AF2. In the AM, when I feel pressure and groggyiness, I work my list AF2 style, scanning from the last item until I find something to do and then returning to the bottom of the list. I do this until I feel less pressure and/or less grogginess, whereupon I move to the front of the list and and follow the current "simple scanning" rules.<br><br>I use paper and pencil. My paper is a bBackwing slate notebook (looks like a moleskine) but I am very fond these days of Baron Fig's Confidant notebook and cannot wait to finish this book (I have a long way to go) and go back to that one.<br><br>I also use Outlook and will often move emails to tasks, and give it the same name as what I write in my book. This way it is an easy search to bring up more info and the related email associated with the task in the paper list.<br><br>Currently I am experimenting with categorizing tasks in Outlook to view tasks by project. I add the project name to my paper list and when i select it review all tasks under that project. <br><br>As I have for years now, track all of my "waiting fors" in Outlook with the @ and their initials, so when I sort in outlook alphabetically they are all together at the top of the list. I then have a recurrent task called 'waiting" that prompts me to do this.<br><br>I also use One Note for taking notes and importing things from the web and from the real world (using Microsoft Lens to capture an image). tasks in One Note get flagged which makes them appear in my task list and then in my paper list.<br><br>Finally, I keep a notebook in my pocket at all times and transfer any ideas that come up into the paper list. <br><br>So far, this is my 2018 setup. What's yours?</div>

<div class="content">vegheadjones:<br><br>Baron Fig notebooks don't seem to be easily available in England. Is there anything about it which would make it worth expending some effort to get hold of (as opposed to buying a similar sized Moleskine)?</div>

<div class="content">My reasons: 1) It lays perfectly flat. 2) The size is just slightly wider than moleskine, which I prefer. 3) The lines are a bit larger and there is no top margin 4) The paper is supposedly better for pen and pencil, I can attest this is true for pencils 5) The cover is cloth which makes it more grippible.<br><br>Downsides: No pocket, no elastic. The Blackwing Slate, which I also prefer over Moleskine has elastic in the spine to hold a writing instrument.</div>

<div class="content">I discovered that re-creating my standard forms each time in a notebook works better than pre-printing them. Must focus on effectiveness, not efficiency. Tracking time by hand and copying to the spreadsheet works better than Toggl or Google Sheets on my phone. My journal is more effective if I start with a blank page and list of questions than a form with questions.<br><br>I plan to experiment with mm grid paper for logs. Combine number and graph in the same line. So far, hours of insomnia lower my numbers of on-track hours, a high number of appointments and social events increase it, but a single appointment often lowers it. How does exercise affect mood? Does perceived productivity match actual hours  (After typing the notebook paragraph, I wonder why I can't just use pages from that? Do the graphs need to be mm-accurate?)<br><br>Last week I took off. This week I'm focusing on some major year-end projects. Next week I'll be back to the monthly and weekly plans. (Plan for me is more about examining the calendar, goals, and checking that I'm not being over-optimistic than firmly stating when I'll do things. It's more about getting information ready so I make informed decisions in the moment than making firm plans.)<br><br><a href="../general_forum/Cricket's Latest System, All the Forms.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2696743</a><br><br>Hillroy spiral-bound graph notebooks. Just under normal size (Letter or A4), will fit in a regular binder. 4 grids/inch, 80 or 200 pages, depending on what was on sale. I tear out pages when they're finished, sometimes tossing, sometimes moving to a binder that I never review. If it's 200 pages, I usually "transfer" after about 80.</div>

<div class="content">Anchored AF2 in a spiral bound A4 notebook. <br><br>My only tweak from Mark's instructions is what I call the 5 minute morning review. I set my timer for 5 minutes and review each task in order from the beginning of the notebook: a task can either be deleted, deleted and re-entered with rephrasing or deleted and entered in my diary. The review process stops when I hit 5 minutes and resumes the next working day.<br><br>Tasks that are not actioned promptly are effectively moving back in the list until they are caught by the morning review.</div>

<div class="content">I am attempting in this new year an analog long list with simple scanning.  I have long done my lists digitally but I was intrigued by the post by Mark regarding attenuation, clumping and maturity. <br><br><a href="../blog/Simple Scanning - Clumping, Attenuation and Maturity.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/12/13/simple-scanning-clumping-attenuation-and-maturity.html</a><br><br>This seemed easier to accomplish with an analog list. I have already seen some extra insight gained by scanning a page of half done tasks or mostly done tasks and seeing what remains.  I use a highlighter to cross out done items so the undone items really stand out. <br><br>You can bet I'm motivated to just do it or delete it when it is the only thing remaining on the notebook page. I have been using a smaller notebook to make seeing that one last undone task on a page a quicker experience.  <br><br>The notebook I'm using is a 4.5 in X 3.25 composition notebook that fits nicely in an old index card wallet .  Easily pocket-able, so it is always with me.<br><br>I also decided to keep personal tasks on the left hand pages and work items on right hand pages. This allows me to skip scanning pages based on my work or personal context. Having them in the same book is good though because I can still easily scan both when needed. <br><br>I still use digital (dynalist.io) for tracking meeting notes and project notes as the search and outline organization features are invaluable for me. But i'm not keeping my running task list there.  <br><br>I also on occasion use a "panic list" on an index card in the same wallet.   As Mark said in another post, sometimes you just need to focus on a small and pointed list for short period of time to get out of panic or emergency mode.  I transfer the panic list back to the main list if anything turned out to be less of an emergency. In other words, I don't keep the panic list around for long.<br><br>All in all, the discussions over the last few months have really led me to organize and group things less and try to let intuition lead out.  I spend less time organizing lists in to groups now.  I feel slightly less on top of "everything" but I feel like I'm actually getting more done faster.  The trade-off is so far good as the "keep scanning to see what I'm doing next is actually faster than re-organizing as long as I keep the focus on crossing things off.  I'm hoping the velocity of doing keeps the list shorter. The shorter the list, the less I will feel I have to categorize and organize.<br><br>Brent</div>

<div class="content">I've been struggling with a system that is somewhat adequate but far from ideal, and I'm slowly poking at trying to find better ways.<br><br>The adequate-but-not-ideal:  This is purely for personal time, and constrained by the fact that I only have three hours in the evening between arriving home and bedtime on weekdays, and I can't get myself to spend much of that time doing "work."  I keep a catchall list that I don't seem to consult very regularly, and every night before bed I plan the two or three things I'll try to get done the next day.  I have a daily focus that is chosen by rotation (Housekeeping, crafting, and mental work), and I tend to pick my next-day items to fit the focus.  <br><br>I'm trying to find a way to better integrate the catchall list and use simple scanning with it.  I also really like Calibre65's idea of a five-minute review.  <br><br>For work, I'm using pretty straightforward simple scanning, and it is working out so far.  We're moving into our busy season so as the workload increases it will get a real test for me.  The challenge here is that I haven't quite solidified what notebook I'll use and how I'll make sure the oldest un-done items don't get lost in my messy scribbles and forgotten.  Once the current spiral notebook is gone, I'm going to try a legal pad.<br><br>So far, I've found drawing a line and adding the date to be extra stuff I need to ignore in the scribblings and I'm not sure it is helping me.   But that may be the fault of how I'm doing it.  More experimentation is needed.</div>

<div class="content">Still doing that Daily FAF thing, but with a minor change in that I go back to the start of the "day" I am "trapped" in instead of going back to where my just-done task was.  I found that this improves flow.<br><br>1. Close the list every start or end of the day with a drawn line.<br>2. Scan down until a task "stands out".  Dot and do this.  After doing it rewrite it if needed at the end of the list, then cross it out.<br>3. Go up the list to the nearest drawn line above your just crossed-out task, then scan down until a task "stands out".  Repeat ad infinitum.</div>

<div class="content">I returned to an analog system: a kind of Bullet Journal on a "Brugge" notebook (a moleskine type of notebook made here in Argentina). The general structure is from the bullet journal method, but the way I approach to the list is more Mark's way. I used a kind of simple scanning with the 5T method from Secrets when I need more impulse and direction.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mr. Backlog,<br><br>Sure, happy to. Let's say I am waiting for you to clear your backlog. I would enter a task in Outlook with the name @MB: clear backlog (@MB stands for Mr. Backlog). And I am waiting (patiently!) for Mark to detail his findings on his latest HITM experiment so I have @MF: HITM rules. As a third example, let's say I emailed Bob Dylan about what he meant when he wrote, "The answer my friend is blowing in the wind." I save all my sent emails to my inbox and process them when I process other emails. When I see one like this I move it to the task list in Outlook and rename it as @BD: answer to "Blowing in the wind." <br><br>I have other tasks in outlook as well, those are copied down in my notebook and do not have the @ prefix. Since my list in outlook is alphabetical, all the @ are on top and grouped by initials of person I am waiting on and I can review them regularly in initial order and follow up when needed.<br><br>One last tip. The search in Outlook works well so before meetings I often enter the @initials to get one person's next actions. I am also now in the habit when writing tasks that are not waiting for's to use the @initials in the text of the action, so the search in outlook will pop those up as well.<br><br>Hope this helps, ask if any questions.</div>

<div class="content">I'm still doting along here.  It amounts to switching between 2 modes of operation: Simple Scanning a long list of tasks to make sure I keep current with everything; and Focusing where I work a small list of tasks to make substantial progress on those, but with freedom to interject any other tasks that come to mind.  Currently I'm simply scanning, but I'll switch shortly.</div>

<div class="meta">2018-01-21 20:47</div>
<div class="content">My system (inspired by Matt Perman What`s best next):<br><br>1) The core is weekly schedule, not tasks. Weekly schedule is not cast in stone and is not overly detailed. Each day I have 4-7 "blocks" of activities (various lengths, from 20 minutes to 2-3 hours). I try to make the schedule as simple as possible so as it repeats most days (Tue,Wed, Thu are almost identical, Mon and Fri are quite similar). As Matt Perman said: the key is having so simple schedule that you do not have to look at it. You know it by memory. <br><br>Of course, I also use regular calendar for appointments, but I only schedule e.g. all my client appointments in "clients" blocks (Mon, Fri - 15-18:30, Tue-Thu 10-12:30) etc. <br><br>That said, I try to by quite flexible. When I started to experiment with weekly schedule, I felt stress and felt still under pressure. Than I relaxed a bit, loose the times and chose only general blocks inside which I define more concrete activities not before these blocks starts. (And of course if unpredictable or inspiration strikes, I change the schedule as needed)<br><br>MY CURRENT BLOCKS = "THEMES" FOR ACTIVITIES:<br><br>Every working day I have (in different orders):<br>- Morning routines (yoga, meditation, cup of tea etc - in strict order so that I do not have to think what to do next)<br>- Client meetings<br>- Admin work (from emails to banking, invoicing, tidying, communication....)<br>- Creative work (articles, preparing marketing, preparing workshops, development...)<br>- Learning Programming<br>- Running<br><br>On some days:<br>- Relax/Friends/Out<br>- Personal/Home Maintenance<br><br>Sunday is free / Saturday is loosely structured<br><br>2) As I said, tasklists are not the core of the systems as used to be for me before. They just complement (specify) what I want do in my blocks - not in all of them, as morning routines are clear and client meetings are based on calendar and notes.<br><br>So I have 4 "projects" for my blocks in Things (app for mac and iPhone):<br>- Admin<br>- Creative<br>- Personal/Things/Home<br>- Programming<br><br>What I try is to put only active (current) tasks/projects in these lists and never to have more tasks in every list than is visible plus minus without scrolling the screen. I cluster tasks by subthemes (eg.banking, communication, client payments, tidy-up in Admin project). I do it on the go, as new subprojects or areas within my main blocks arise - so the structure inside tasklists is still flexible. <br><br>That is more or less the system. I use other Things functions like Due dates or Schedule but I use it within these "projects" = tasklists, so it  does not change the main idea much.<br><br>What was very interesting for me was how this system (based on regular weekly schedule) started to simplify itself. I started with regular weekly reviews and daily reviews but as I go now, I use weekly review very sporadically and I do not make my "daily tasklist" every day as I used to do, only sometimes. Because I just know what to do based on my lists/schedule and I know what is important (I am constantly looking inside lists when I am inside any block, re-categorizing, re-prioritizing tasks etc). What I do in these blocks? What I know is important from the subprojects/subareas in tasklists. No standing out, no rules, just common sense, going for balance and importance.<br><br>Every morning I briefly look at "today" tasks (scheduled or due for today), which are already positioned in individual tasklists. I try not to schedule many tasks, so they are usually just 1-5 of them, including "deferred". Even if I would not check it in the morning, I would see them as the block starts as I look into its tasklist.<br><br>The rest of the day, I switch between blocks (and look into their tasklists) based on my schedule . That is all. <br><br>(I also use "someday-maybe" lists, which are more specific by themes/areas, but it is not the core of the system, just addition.) <br><br>For me it is best system I ever tried and the paradox is that I refused the idea of such strict "weekly schedule" quite long, trying to experiment still with long-lists, daily tasklists etc. I was worried about my freedom, spontaneity etc. At the end when nothing worked much, I get it a try, experimented with it a bit (had to loose it, not overplan, overcomplicate etc) and it is not before now when I really find my freedom and spontaneity in my tasks...within the border of my blocks, beyond which my head stays clear.</div>

<div class="content">Daneb:<br><br>There is a sense in which scheduling things is necessarily the primary mode of operating, and making things routine in that schedule is the only way to be fully productive.  A long list can't quite get you there because the fact is there are fixed moments in your week, and activities that must happen every time, and the way to do those fastest is to make them automatic.  No scheduling, no reading, no preparing because you are already prepared.  It's hard to beat the efficiency of going to bed at a regular hour, doing the exact same thing before bed each time, and then getting up at a regular hour and doing the exact same thing in the morning to prepare for work.  If anything therein is not fully efficient you can change it to optimize it, and if you have time to spare you can then your tools to aid you in discretionary activities.<br><br>After the routine blocks are established, the remaining blocks of time you fill however you choose.  For that, I still prefer lists.<br><br><br>(Link for my system which doesn't reference time blocks; it describes what I do in the open spots: <a href="../general_forum/Doting On My List.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2696352</a> )</div>

<div class="content">I reckon you have to adapt a system depending on your own needs.<br>For instance (in my view), a long list and simple scanning works if you have a quick turnover of tasks.<br>When the list gets too long to manage (in terms of you loose track of what needs doing next and potentially miss deadlines), then something more sophisticated is needed.<br>Perhaps to include some priority measures. e.g. have some urgency zones - maybe 3 lists to work from (do now, do within a week, do next month etc). That way you can work through a shorter list and not get overwhelmed and use stand out on that list only.<br>I have been doing that for a while and it helps.<br><br>One point is that I do the standout bit when I first see the task and then drop it in the right list. Cut out the wheat from the chaff! The other tasks all need to be done at some point, but can wait.<br>There are so many ways of doing tasks, I guess we just need to find one that keeps us all happy and worry free!<br>Or maybe we can pick out bits of time management systems that seem to work for us and combine them into one.<br>PS urgency zone is from Michael Linenberger, but I did not like all the other ideas he has.</div>
