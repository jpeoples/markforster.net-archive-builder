<div class="content">So far I'm really loving RAF. I do have one concern. Right now I have 120 tasks and 25 active pages. It seems like my list is getting worked on from both ends due to reverse and forward modes but the tasks in the middle are getting stale. I was thinking about adding a task that was "work on middle page" and just following the forward mode approach from somewhere in the middle. Thoughts? Or just "trust the system"?</div>

<div class="content">Ron,<br><br>I think the answer to all such problems (can't get to first, last, middle, etc) comes down to the list being too large.  I mean if you have 120 tasks and it takes you lots of time to work on a task, you're going to move slowly.  I don't see anyway around that.<br><br>But if you are looking for a tweak, maybe going back to where Mark was just before RAF ... something like put an item to switch at each end of the list then work as long as you like in forward, then reverse, etc.  That way, you can move forward and not keep jumping to the end when you can't progress on a page.<br><br>Or, worst case, go back to AF1 and plow through the list from beginning to end, in order.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ron,<br><br>It sounds like you might have a "sticking page" - is there one page that you get to in forward mode where nothing is standing out on a regular basis?  <br><br>If that's the case, I would take the opportunity to really look at those tasks and break them down to find something to do that you can do a little of, and re-write the task at the end of the list.  Or you can take one of the tasks and break it down into more do-able pieces at the end of your list and count that as working on it.  Or, if it's something you're unsure whether you're even going to / should be doing it, write a question mark at the end of it and turn it into a choice of whether to do it or not.  If the answer is "yes", then write the tasks to complete it at the end of your list and keep moving forward in forward mode.<br><br>In AF1, I sometimes would come to pages which had only these big, ugly tasks left, and I would take the one I had the *most* resistance to - and break that down into non-resisting types of tasks at the end of the list (as a kind of checklist) so that I could keep moving forward rather than dismiss the page.<br><br>I wouldn't change where I moved forward from though.  I think many of us have found that where we are tempted to tweak is where we need to think about our list operation.  Have you thought of going through your list and doing some pre-dismissal?  Maybe what's on that page or pages isn't something you really want to be doing right now?<br><br>I hope this helps - could you explain more about what happens when your forward mode breaks down?<br></div>

<div class="content">Good points guys!<br><br>Jacqueline,<br>I guess my problem is forward mode. Although I go to it several times a day, it just never moves so it's back to reverse mode. Let's face it, I've seen those items so many times and not done anything with them so they're either not important or urgent (at least to get them started)<br><br>Someone left a good post recently about evaulating your dismissed items. Why didn't I move on these? Not important? Too big of a job to get started? It almost felt like an "audit" approach. Very inciteful. So maybe this is a strength of the system?</div>

<div class="content">Ron, I know what you mean - it's the endless loop in RAF and the major reason I went back to AF1.  <br><br>Just another suggestion to make that front end move a little faster - put the whole page (or pages!) up for review / under threat of dismissal, not just a block of one or two tasks.  Then you'll be forced to make decisions and keep moving at a faster pace.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-9 16:50</div>
<div class="content">One more thing Ron - if you write the reason down for *why* you want that task done, it might help to break down your resistance.  Just one good reason should do it.  If the reason is stupid (eg. I don't want someone unimportant to be mad at me), dismiss the task.  If the reason is good but you still feel resistance to the task, then look at the task - is THAT task the best way to achieve your reason?  Say, for example, I could come to "wash floors" on my list, but I have resistance to doing it.  My reason is good - I want a home that I feel happy living in.  But the fact is that right now, the floors aren't in too bad a shape, but I have a big mess in the bathroom.  So, I could just do a spot wipe of the floors and declare it done, or I could just dismiss it, write "bathroom mess" at the end of the list, go to reverse mode and do that and maybe the floor would stand out now.  But hopefully not.  :-)<br><br>As another example of a less trivial task:  I was coming to my writing tasks and feeling resistance to them on a regular basis.  I took an Elizabeth George quote (she procrastinated on writing for years) and wrote it in my book:  "I thought on my deathbed I could say 'I could have written a novel' or 'I wrote a novel'."  If I ever feel resistance to those tasks, I read that quote and it breaks me past it.   But I still have to break down that big task I have or set a timer to get started for 5 minutes with permission to stop after that time.  Or try just sitting down for 10 minutes - doing NOTHING - and contemplating the tasks.  I surprise myself by being super motivated to do it then.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Ron:<br><br>Also, don't forget the little known aspect of AF (i.e. "raf") -- you can scrap items off your list at anytime, and you can target them directly and anytime whether in FM or in RM. They *don't* have to be above the line and put on review first.<br><br>I think some of the genesis of the various "tweaks" we see to the system, whether in this thread or others, might stem from forgetting that Mr. Forster envisioned this *additional common-sense approach* to getting items off the list when they don't belong, or they are hampering movement.<br><br>I don't think he envisioned someone having to wait until the system effected the removal of an item that was no longer relevant or an item one no longer had any intention of doing. This would be equivalent, say, to a proponent of GTD not doing the next action on a project because he hasn't written down the next action. That wouldn't make much sense.<br><br>I tend to think if one keeps this common sense "rule" in mind, then the discussion of how to "pre-filter" what one puts on the list (i.e. the "grass-catcher" discussion) loses some of its relevancy. You just put stuff on your list. Later, if you see it and it doesn't belong on the list you take it off. In the *meantime* you might run across it in the system and skip it, or action it, or it might be put on review. <br><br>In your case, if you keep seeing items in the early part of your list and you you aren't doing them, and you *aren't going to do them*, then you *don't* have to wait for the line to sweep across the early pages in order to get rid of them. You can just get rid of them. Presto! Now when you go into forward mode they won't be holding you up (i.e. kicking you back into Reverse Mode) and you will be able to continue on, eventually getting to those "middle pages". <br><br>Thoughts? What say the other forum members and practitioners of AF? Have I fairly presented Mr. Forster's approach?<br><br>--Joseph<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Ron, you do have a lot of pages for only having 120 open tasks.  If you had a lot of single tasks that could go up for review alone, it could take quite a while to get through them.  And you could possibly not see the middle of your book for a week or two.  I found in AF1 that I kind of set an upper limit in my mind of a) the optimal time to close a page (in my case ~ 2 weeks) and b) an upper limit on the number of active pages ~ 10, definitely no more than 15.<br><br>Whenever I had days with a lot of discretionary time, I would move as quickly as possible doing and dismissing to get those page numbers down.  So I'm with Mike, I would switch to AF1 alone (old dismissal rules) and get those old pages cleared.  The problem could be solved in a day then instead of a couple of weeks.<br><br>Christine had a similar situation to yours, only even more pages.  Hopefully, she can chime in since she's been able to tackle them easily using RAF (more using reverse mode than forward mode I think).   I think she zooms back pretty quickly to get at them.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Ron<br><br>Yes, Jacqueline is right.  The number of open pages can become an issue as it takes time to move back or forwards (and particularly forwards) when there are only 1 or 2 items to a page.  The thing to remember is that, as you clear tasks the number of pages gets less and less so you start to move more quickly through those middle pages.<br><br>Two practical things that have helped me:-<br><br>My stats spreadsheet is set to show 100 pages of AF on the screen, in 4 blocks of 25.  When a page is cleared it is shown in a different colour so I can see at a glance which pages are open and closed and how many items remain on each.  Being able to literally "see" a pattern I'm sure helps my subconscious when moving through.  I naturally think of my pages in groups (51 to 75, 76 to 100) and clearing those blocks have become mini-goals which I am sure helps tasks to stand out more easily.<br><br>Secondly, my "digital version" in OneNote enables me to move completed pages to another section so that it is easier to look through 25 active pages rather than say 70 actual pages to locate those 25.<br><br>The thing with reverse mode is that each new page, by the time you fill it and start a fresh one, will normally (for me at least) have less than 10 items still active (and usually less than 5). I find that new tasks can get cleared fairly quickly, as can more recent items, leaving me more time available to move back.  I also find that my phrasing of tasks is now slightly different.  I am now more likely to put "project x" than "project x - step 1", "project x - step 2" etc and to keep those steps, or next actions separate from my list.  It is then easier to address "project x" for as short a period of time as required and to then move it forward.  Sometimes if I am working fairly intensively on a project in bursts throughout the day, it may well appear on a page 4 or 5 times, but if I had it down as say 10 seperate tasks and that project itself did not stand out, I would have a set of resisted tasks (and not necessarily together in one group) that would begin to block my progress.<br><br>Hope that may help a little?</div>

<div class="content">One trick I use to deal with items that are getting 'stuck' and thus holding middle pages open (because I keep 'skipping' over the items every time).<br><br>I pick one of these items and say "its time to examine why it is never popping up as 'ready to do'. I put my diot beside it. I think (or write) about the teas; why did I think it needed to be done in the first place? why might I be resisting it? Can I break it down into simpler steps? Can I 'make a start' by getting the file out (or whatever)?<br><br>This qualifies as 'working on it' even if I dont actually do anything else.<br><br>Then I can cross it off (as I did some work on it) and decide what to add to the end of my list as a result - I might decide to re-enter it, modify it in some way or break it down - or I might decide to leave it behind.<br><br>This trick works a treat for me and helps me close those 'pesky middle pages' sooner.<br><br>Paul<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I have a growing pool of untouched pages in the middle of my book, because my periods in forward mode do not as yet reach them (it is a matter of volume rather than a "sticking page".<br><br>This may well be sorted when the Line of Doom eventually forces a mass dismissal. Or more likely intuition will have me stay in forward mode longer before that situation transpires.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence,<br><br>Or, it may pay for me to repeat my solution ... go through the list an ruthlessly purge.  If your list is too large, make it smaller.  That was my problem and my solution and so far, I'm happy with it.</div>

<div class="content">Long time lurker's first post.  I have a similar problem with rarely visited middle pages.  My solution is to have a Post It tab sticking out that marks the middle page.  Then whenever I feel that the middle pages are being neglected I set myself the constraint that I have to reach the middle page tab whichever direction I'm travelling in at the time.  Every so often I'll check that the middle tab is still in the middle.  Hope that makes sense.</div>

<div class="content">If I'm worried about middle pages then, for me, nothing stands out in Reverse Mode on my latter pages. (At least nothing is standing out so much as my middle pages are.)  I don't see need for a tweak inasmuch as "standing out" is a relative standard.</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Laurence,<br><br>>>> I hear you, but .. when the Line of Doom reaches the untouched pages the Purge you suggest will happen, will it not?  <<<<br><br>Yes it will, and if that works, then no problem.  However, if it does not work for some reason, it is likely that the list is too big and would benefit from being smaller.  In which case, one either lives with it not working or makes it smaller.  Remember, in various cases Mark has suggested starting over from scratch.  Some on this list have done just that when the water reached thier nose.  I found that all I needed to do was purge everything I was not comitted to doing in the next week.  Then, to keep it from happening again, make it a rule to instantly dismiss any new item that I knew I would not do in a week.<br><br>>>>  I'm a big believer in using intuition with Mark's systems, and I'm cautious about adding any changes which might undermine the trust or link between the system and the subconscious mind.

If it does not, it pays to think about why it does not and make changes accordingly.  For me, all of the AF systems work well with a list of some limited size.  I'm sure that the size will vary from person to person and I don't even really know what the size is for me.  I just hit upon the solution when trying to figure out what was going wrong for me.  I realized that I was endlessly reading over items that I had no intention of doing any time soon and that they should not be there at all.  Speaking only for myself, I am perfectly capable of making judgements about if an item is something I intend to do or something I would like to get around to someday.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Here's the thing. If people put more on their list than they do, then the list will grow unless there is some purging procedure, and you prefer the conscious purge rather than waiting for the Line of Doom.<br><br>I prefer - Occam-like - to avoid adding a new rule.<br><br>Having said that, I wonder if the rules for forward mode should be eased to allow people to move more quickly - e.g. instead of leaving the mode when one doesn't feel like doing anything on a page, how about leaving the mode when one feels like it (i.e. just go to the next page when nothing stands out). This would make it easier to reach the middle area and stay there for a while, which is an issue which has arisen in other threads.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">LOL learning - I was reading "1984" last night and hoping I wouldn't dream about having a cage of rats on my head for my thought crimes.<br><br>Lawrence, I've been following your idea of moving on in forward mode in AF1, just because I have quite a few items on my home list that only weekends provide.  (And not even every weekend.)   I've always thought that there's a world of difference between how someone would or could operate AF if they are not self employed and working from home or retired, but are working at a regular job.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Laurence:<br><br>Regarding the "easing of the rules". Wouldn't that "ease" you right out of AutoFocus?<br><br>It *seems* to me that if you can just cruise down your list in forward mode, page after page, looking for something to do then what you really have is just one giant "to do" list and you are looking for something to do on it. Just like our ancestors did B.A.F. (Before Auto Focus).<br><br>The Forward Mode rule creates a closed list. If nothing feels ready to be done you don't go to the next page. . . so you had better do something (even a teeny tiny something) to see that next page. It *forces* you to work. <br><br>And, don't forget, if nothing on that page is ever really going to be actionable (for whatever reason) you can just delete all of those items and then continue on to the next page.<br><br>But in the above two scenarios, unlike with easing the rules, there is an AutoFocus engine that is driving us to action or decision making.<br><br>Just my thoughts.<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if one way of managing this that is in the spirit of AF is to switch to Forward Mode when it stands out. If nothing stands out on a page, return to reverse mode. This should be the requirement to encourage you to do at least something on the current forward mode page. As soon as the foreward mode task stands out again, return to the next page after the one you were working. So you work pages 1-3 until there's nothing on 3 that stands out. You go to reverse mode and keep working until you see Forward Mode and it stands out. Then you begin on page 4. For those that don't want to trim their lists outside of the standard AF dismissal, this might be very effective. Or maybe this is already the rule? I've always started with the first open page when in Forward Mode.</div>

<div class="content">Joseph:<br><br>I have now reached the slough of untouched pages at the middle, a good test of the AF engine. There is the additional dynamic from the rules that one can select items that break up that part of the list into smaller contiguous chunks.<br><br>This is the part of the process that, hopefully, is corrective and keeps a balance between input and output.
