<div class="content">After over a year of being the hard core analog AF/DWM user, I'm finally going digital (at least for now...). <br><br>DWM was the first of Mark's systems that seemed to be intuitively digital to me, but I lacked a portable digital device. Now I am the proud owner of an iPad (my husband spoils me) and am toying with digital solutions.  Right now I've put together a version using a $.99 app called Sorted, but I'd be very curious to hear if anybody has another inexpensive app that they're using for a digital implementation.</div>

<div class="content">Good decision. If I had an Apple device I'd be using TaskPaper. And Dropbox for backing up and synchronization with my desktop PC. Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>Do a search here on Toodledo for a complete description of how I did it before I scrapped it all.  I implemented DWM in that software, then just as easily converted it to my simple priority/schedule system.  It is a web based application with an iPhone app to access it.   I'm sure it will work on the iPad. Ideal because you can do power typing on your computer and just check things off on your portable device. Basically you can set the default entry date for new items to one month hence and it keeps things sorted as entered.  It has unlimited tagging, folders, goals, priority ... you name it.  Give it a quick look on the net and see what you think.<br><br><a href="http://www.toodledo.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.toodledo.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">Dropbox:  Yeah, I can't say enough good things about that product.  My iPhone is synced to all my other computers and they are synced to each other.  It has virtually done away with my old USB sticks to move stuff around.  The big feature, to me at least, is that it works in the background.  When you save a file it syncs everywhere automagically.<br><br>If you do decide you want to give it a spin, there is a free version (about 3GB storage, IIRC) and an iPhone app.  Sweet.  If you use this link to sign up for the free version<br><br>https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI1MTk0MDU5<br><br>I get 250MB additional storage for the referral.  Not enough to get me to recommend something that does not work, but enough to give me some extra breathing room ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hey Mike<br><br>You beat me to it with that referral link :-) Yes, Dropbox rapidly becomes indispensable.<br><br>I think if Sarah uses your link she gets an extra 256MB too, so it's win/win.</div>
