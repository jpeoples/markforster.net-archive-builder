<div class="content">I'm quite astonished how well AF4 keeps the number of pages down. I converted from RAF (AF3) and had about 10-15 active pages. Now I never seem to get beyond 3 or 4. The forced reviews are what makes this happen (i.e. not wanting to do something from the closed list, but rather return to the open list). I find that I'm doing reviews every couple of days or so. <br><br>In order not to keep highlighting many items and copy them over and over again, I've been thinking hard about why some tasks are not getting cleared. Often, it's because I really don't intend to work on these in the next few days. So instead of dismissing outright, or mindlessly copying back to the end of the open list, I've been using my tickler files (see <br><br><a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/tickler.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/tickler.html</a><br><br>if you don't understand the 43-folders "tickler" system) more, to bring tasks back into the open AF list at just the right time. I use one AF4 notebook for both home and work, but have separate tickler files at each location.<br><br>The benefits of placing longer-lead items into the tickler are that the AF4 list stays even more compact, and only a few tasks get highlighted for review.</div>

<div class="content">My experience has been the same.  I put a lot more into the tickler than I did before.  It helps keep the AF list "focused".<br><br>I've also been consolidating project-related tasks more.  I have always tried to do that to some degree, but I've been finding that it's working better for me to be stricter in this regard.<br><br>For example, I had about a dozen various home-repair projects scattered across my Closed List.  I pulled those out, put them all on a separate list, which I will prioritize with my wife.  Then I'll just put the top 1-2 items on AF.</div>

I'm using Gmail Calendar to set up tickler reminders by email. And I like the way AF4 encourages making separate project lists as and when appropriate.</div>
