<div class="content">There are a lot of different ways to shuffle tasks around and select the one to work on, but for me, that's not the real problem. The "standing out" mechanism from the original AutoFocus still works best for me - with 1 great "BUT" only:<br><br>Very often, I scan a part of my list, and nothing stands out ...<br>... but when I consciously do the effort to ask myself: "What would be a tiny little bit I could do for these tasks?",<br>all of a sudden, I see a lot of alluring tasks to tackle!<br><br>This happens more likely in a situation when I don't have that much time, and I think it's because the old maxim I was brought up with, "if you start something, you have to finish it" is still very deep-rooted.<br><br>So, looking at tasks through the "little but often"-glasses has still not become second nature to me, and I might be not the only one. (Could it be the never ceasing fascination here in this forum with new methods – methods that basically are intended to replace the purely intuitive "standing out" mechanism – stems from problems with just seeing the next "Little" in the tasks?)<br><br>Whatever, I suggest we should discuss the fine art of "doing little"!<br><br>My first idea has been to do a special pass through my list and to add remarks of possible "next little steps". So, <br><br>- Answer AGs letter<br><br>may become:<br><br>- Answer AGs letter: make mind-map of points to say<br><br>Or:<br><br>- Repair blinds<br><br>may become:<br><br>- Repair blinds: take measurements, list of parts to replace<br><br>I am looking forward to your ideas and comments!</div>

<div class="content">I have 4 things related to that:<br><br>1.  When using either FV or No-List FV, I like to break down a large project into the next small thing to do on the project and write that down as a "before" project, even though it's really a sub-project. I also remember one of the methods, people using the question of "what would make X easier" when selecting projects to do before that project.<br><br>2. Ah ha! I finally found this thread. This is also related:<br><a href="../fvp_forum/What will help me complete X.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2572204</a><br><br>I haven't tried changing the question to "what will help me complete X" as the question in FVP specifically but it's pretty similar:<br><br>Jesse wrote:<br><br><< I've discovered a new question that has made it really satisfying as well as forcing me get to work on stuff I might otherwise put off, and that's... <br><br>"What will help me complete X?"<br><br>I'm still playing with it, but there's something that feels really good about the algorithm pinpointing those things that are subtasks and putting them in a reasonable order. There's a little less resistance this way too, as the easier tasks tend to happen first. >><br><br>3. Using timeboxing, I'll intentionally only work for something for a few minutes.  This gets me to break it down into what I can get started on now.<br><br>4. Currently using the method on the front page of the blog, which is the random method with the dot-and-do variation + what Mark said about only having things on the list which you are fully committed to doing.  In that case, you never pass over the list skipping things that don't stand out, so there isn't as much of a need to make them more appealing, maybe.</div>

<div class="content">When following a method that aims to complete everything at the end of the day, it's sometimes helpful to refine the work statement beyond say "Clean", unless to you that means a very specific scope of cleaning.  It helps to say I have achieved this.<br><br>Having said that, I often don't.  A restatement might only arise if I find I want to do a thing but i'm stuck procrastinating.  Adding a more precise first step helps.<br><br>Gonna go now, I have a little more work to do.</div>

<div class="content">This is similar to GTD's Next Action.<br><br>The example in his book is something like New tires for car. It feels like it's a business hours thing, since it involves a store, but you never seem to tackle it. When you narrow it down to the very next action, it's actually call your friend (during home hours) to ask about the store he liked.</div>
