<div class="content">Instead of keeping a 'to do' list of any kind, I've been keeping a list of, well, everything in workflowy.  Each day I start a new list with that day's date.  Anything that I 'touch' that day I move to that day's list.  On each daily list I also keep a note of the last time I reviewed that list (read thru it).  I know the 'closed list' idea came from Mark, I used to use AF.<br><br>I've used different rules over time for how often to review old lists, but the gist being, the older the list the longer I go in between reviews.  Currently, I review any of this month's lists every other day, last months list every 4 days, etc.<br><br>Workflowy makes it super easy to search for items and move them around.  So say I finally get around to making an appt for my daughter's annual eye dr visit.  I do a search for 'schedule eye dr'.  Move that item from whatever old list it was on to today's list.  Probably change it to 'Eye appt for daughter 7/2 9AM, make list of questions ahead of time'.<br><br>Anyway, I've been using this since Dec 2012.  It just kind of evolved, and has worked so well for me I've stuck with it.<br><br>Examples of items on my everything list:<br>ABC Plumber #vendor (with sub list of history of plumber issues/visits, also contact info)<br>Daughter #sicklog sinus infection? (with sub list of symptoms day by day so if I have to take her to the dr I know when it started)<br>Master bedroom sheets - changed Sunday<br>Return netflix dvd / watch for new<br>Balance checkbook (last done 6/1) <br>Kids summer camp sign ups / activities (with sub list of contact info, dates, etc)<br>etc<br><br>So I don't worry a lot about differentiating what needs to be done, vs. what I have done.  When I review lists things jump out at me.  I do delete things sometimes, but it's not a big deal.  Things I don't work on just slowly drift into oblivion as I review the older lists less and less often.</div>

<div class="content">Somewhere in his books GED and DIT, Mark suggests the general rule of writing everything down _before_ you do it. He also repeated this rule in the discussions on here.<br><br>It seems to me, you just skipped this rule on it's head by writing everything down _after_ you have done it.</div>
