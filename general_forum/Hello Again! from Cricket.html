<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2024-10-8 20:46</div>
<div class="content">Wow, I can still sign in.<br><br>I was last active...way back in 2017, when I realized I was spending more time discussing how to organize my tasks than actually doing them. I see some familiar names, and some new ones, and the same intelligent discussion. It's been a discombobulated few years, and I really need to focus on my routines. (Nothing terrible, just too many months of making excuses, plus 2 boomerang kids, one with a dog, with their own very erratic routines. Guess which kid took a 4-month summer job in another province.)<br><br>So many new systems! (Setting timer now. Too many new systems! Must focus on the more recent threads and ignore the rest.) Wow! So many people in the lenten challenge.<br><br>I tried rebooting in the way that I always have before: Start new book (or section). Old tasks, to work through with a long-list system, usually AF1, FV, or FVP. Page for the week with big rocks and events. As many pages as needed for work in progress. When the next week starts, the previous week's pages become part of the big list. I gave it a twist this time, making a few week pages, and not enough pages between them, and it didn't work. I think it's too front-loaded. The initial list is too long. Important things are burried in it. Yes, the long list systems above can deal with that, but it's overwhelming. Long list systems don't work well if you don't look at the list all week.<br><br>RTM looks interesting. I'm going to incorporate some of that thinking into my current system. New, routine, and unfinished tasks really do take a different mindset. Looking at the unfinished in the same order each time reminds me of Spinning Plates. (Oh, how nice it is to use those acronymns without having to explain them!) <br><br>I want to add a history section. How much time each week do I need to spend in each area each week to break even? To catch up? To actually do the annual cleaning? Am I really putting in the time? Leave lots of room for the day. At the same time, I don't want to have to copy things between todo and done lists. Combine them somehow? Maybe use DIT, but how much to leave for each day? I might do bottom-up for new tasks. <br><br>Choosiness: Instead of a separate very empty page for each unfinished project (per RTM), maybe add "work on X" to the week or day page. Those pages have limited space, and some of it is already filled with routine tasks. (My projects usually have folders, so they don't need a page in my planner.)<br><br>I need to be careful. In some ways, adding routines helps me actually do things. In others, though, it's a recipe for over-commitment.<br><br>Pull instead of push. I like that more than motivation. What goals are pulling me? What's in the way of me acheiving them?<br><br>It's tempting to switch to Notion, but I've found in the past that paper works best for keeping me focused, even though summarizing and organizing is harder. I know paper's cheap, but I hate leaving extra space!<br><br>LAPS. Oh dear. My new system is evolving. <br><br>Short list, yes! Fewer but longer tasks: 5 minutes on bathroom, repeat daily, instead of sinks on Monday, tub on Tuesday, etc. It also reminds me of Wheel of Life and Covey's Roles and Goals.<br><br>Sooner/Later. If it's on the week or day page, it's Sooner. Maybe write Later and New on the bottom, so I don't have to flip pages.<br><br>How to Pursue all Your Goals. A separate section for each goal, so I can see progress, makes a lot of sense.<br><br>How am I Feeling Now? Thich Nhat Hanh suggests a mindfulness bell every 15 minutes. When it rings, take 3 minutes to just breathe and observe yourself. I tried that a few times, but it breaks my deep focus and gets annoying. If I was doing something important, I need to pick up the threads again. If I was doing something unimportant, it reminds me that my time for rest is over.<br><br>KeepFocus. Again with two lists! Definitely a change from before. No "not ready" list? <br><br>AutoFocus Condensed. I've done something similar, but in 2 layers (week and day), and tried to do it last week, but pulled too many things forward, and moved some to next week. (Not DIT, but DINW.) I like how anything on today's list that you don't finish automatically rejoins the big list. (Just realized, that's from 2009, but a more recent post referred to it. Maybe I already read and incorporated the ideas!)<br><br>++++<br><br>I suppose I should actually do something more productive now.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome back, Cricket! Your presence has been missed!<br><br>Your email looks like the inside of my head when I'm stressed out and don't know what to do next. So much noise in the system! I hope the noise quiets down so that what needs to be done next stands out clearer for you.</div>

<div class="content">Noise in the system is right. I remember a time when I stayed on top of things. It felt good.<br><br>Today I considered calling that system The River. I'm in the middle of the river. The front of the book is downstream, the past. The back of the book is the future. I move through the book. That maybe pushing the metaphor way too hard, but I like the name.<br><br>I'm also working on a system called Ready, Willing and Able. Find one task, any task, that you feel Ready, Willing and Able to do, that will make something else easier. Ideally, it will make something important easier, but don't stress over it. Doing something useful is more important than doing the most useful thing. (Looking for the most useful thing leads to stalling.) It has to be something that reduces chaos. (Move one thing to a better place instead of dumping the entire drawer.)<br><br>Often you'll find that small success (dopamine) makes you able to tackle something harder next, but it's ok if it doesn't. You're still farther ahead than if you'd done nothing.<br><br>It's more of a supplement than a system. It's a question for long list systems. (Remember when we played with different questions?) <br><br>It forces you to think about what's next in the project (GTD NA and Mark's What to do before X), and whether you can do it now (GTD context). It's small and doable (BJFogg's B=MAT and Mark's Just Get Out The Folder). It raises dopamine (ADHD Interrupted's Two Part Task). It decreases chaos (A Slob Come's Clean).<br><br>For now, though? I'm going to laugh. I just came home from the store with a new 1/2" binder for my lists, and realized there was an identical one on my shelf, ready to use.</div>

<div class="content">Good to hear from you, Cricket!<br><br><< It has to be something that reduces chaos >><br><br>This reminds me of one of the principles in the book, "How To Measure Anything" by Hubbard.  He says a common mistake is to try to find the perfect, complete measurement -- to get a comprehensive view.  When it seems impossible to achieve that, then people just give up and don't even try to measure anything.  It's much more useful to think of the purpose of measurement as "reducing uncertainty".  And there are LOTS of things we can do to reduce uncertainty.  And when we start looking at the problem this way, we suddenly start getting lots of new insights. <br><br>I like this idea about reducing chaos.  I think many of us here have tried for years to find the "perfect" time management system -- perfect for ourselves, at least.  Maybe taking this approach -- just trying to find some way to reduce the chaos -- would lead to more sustainable breakthroughs.</div>

<div class="content">I'm an engineer IRL. (Well, I was, for a few years, but the plan to go back when the kids went to school was never implemented.)<br><br>Much of our skill is deciding whether we need to spend more time and money making better measurements, or if we should go with what we've got and leave a safety margin. Many disasters were caused by saying, "We have a really good model of X, so don't need to leave a safety margin." Then they discover the model was wrong. Or they spend $$ on custom pipes that are just thick enough, instead of the off-the-shelf pipe that's readily available (and has a safety margin). Of course, sometimes the extra cost is worth it, if you can place a bulk order, have very little space to fit everything, need to keep weight down, or are using an expensive metal.</div>

<div class="content">Chirp!<br><br>I enjoyed reading your posts again!  For me, it’s like a constant evolution of systems over time.  I noticed you cited a few of my ideas.  I’m still roughly in the same mode as when I wrote these things.  My worksheet of everything I might possibly consider doing fits on a page.  Sometimes it works great.  Having it all readily accessible solves the problem of the nagging feeling there’s something better I’m not doing but I don’t know what.  Instead, I know what’s better that I’m not doing.  And sometimes I choose to do that instead, lol.  But it’s easier on my mind this way.</div>

<div class="content">Hi again, Alan!<br><br>Wow, I was really stressed when I wrote all that. Things are coming together again, finally! Reviewing different systems helped me remember what's important to all of them, and I've probably been trying to avoid. It also reminded me of things that many systems have (optional, use if works, drop if not), and none (don't do!!).<br><br>Everything you might possibly consider doing fits on one page? Maybe that's what I've been doing wrong!<br><br>I'm currently doing it by time. 30 minutes each day on housework. Start by doing the dailies, then weeklies, then monthlies, then yearlies -- until the time is up. Same with deskwork, but that's an hour starting with email triage, then urgent, and eventually some less urgent, not fun, but useful and brain-clearing projects.<br><br>At the end of the day, set a short intention for housework and deskwork, and focus on the feeling of Done! It has to be short, so I can see the end of it. Yay ADHD! Long term goals don't pull us, for multiple reasons. If that's all I do, at least I did that, but if the dopamine kicks in, use it!<br><br>Weekly review of the big list, making a shorter list for the week. Also review next 2 weeks of calendar! Daily review of the week list, no need to go back to the big list.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket! I've been keeping an eye out for you here. I remembered a post from you once that was really supportive and/or informative, about ADHD maybe. I went looking for it using search recently, going through all your posts that I could find; can't remember if I found it but I found a link to your goodreads because you linked something there and you added a book I mentioned to it. I was thinking for a long time of posting a question here to ask if you were still around here. That makes sense if you stepped away because it was taking too much time.<br><br>Routines: routines have helped out a lot. At one point a few years ago I started a text file and started putting a daily routine on it. I could check items off of it as long as I did SOME work on that item (e.g. 1 minute) but often would get inspired to do more after getting into it. (I can also check the item if it's not applicable today / decide not to do it. On paper I write "N" but digitally I just check off the item for today.) I would print off a new copy every day, but eventually fell off the routine. I recently ran across Google Keep as an app which has the killer features I needed: quickly add to the list, or insert in the middle of the list, drag to re-order the list items, check the item moves it to the bottom but keeps it in order, and I can RESET the list (uncheck all items) in about 2 clicks, and it stays in sync between all platforms.<br><br>Right now one of my main productivity tools is breaking things down, or rather, breaking the first step of the first step down. Either with a blank piece of paper (I keep a pile of fresh paper near me) or on a tablet, or just any Notes app, I write something I'm trying to get started on, then I indent and write the first step to do that, and then if needed I indent and write the first step to do that. I also make notes of data that I figure out as I'm working (phone number, URL, file location, etc.).<br><br>I have to say though, I don't think I'm close to figuring it out after a couple decades of trying systems. I have the number of an ADHD psychiatrist on my desk but haven't made the call yet. My main doctor says I have a lot of coping skills I use (like the ones I mentioned above) and high blood pressure so he's not inclined to medicate me.</div>

<div class="content">I forgot to mention one thing that helped a lot was when I had a manager who was concerned about my productivity, I suggested that I tell him what I'm planning to do today at the beginning of the day, then at the end of the day I'd tell him how it went. That helped a lot since even if I did it at the last moment, I'd at least do something for a main project every day which would do a lot to get things started today rather than later. That's the commitment / short timeline that seems to help with ADHD (while creating stress unfortunately), but in general who would want to voluntarily commit to that unless forced to?</div>

<div class="content">Yes, routines help a lot. Mine all fell when Covid hit and my kid stopped needing a ride to/from school, then moved to uni.<br><br>Paper works better for me. To use a list I need to sit at the computer, or fight my way through a touch screen. Paper just feels better, and more permanent. When I finish something, there's a record, at least until I finish the notebook.<br><br>Medication for ADHD can reduce blood pressure because it reduces stress. Some respond well to SSRIs for ADHD. I suspect it's because they also reduce anxiety, reducing the mental load.<br><br>I've tried daily checkins, but invariably my buddy or I get distracted, or need a break and we don't restart.</div>

<div class="content">Good to see you posting again Cricket.<br><br>Regarding staying organized with  ADHD.  One of the better books I've read about it is "Order from Chaos: The Everyday Grind of Staying Organized with Adult ADHD" by Jaclyn Paul.  She borrows a lot of principles from GTD so it's not revolutionary or anything but my key take away was how to deal  with  "if I can't see it I forget about it"   Making my work more visual both physically and even visualizing what needs to be done more vividly in my mind can be really helpful.</div>

<div class="content">Downloading it now. We'll see if it kickstarts something.<br><br>The problem isn't not knowing what to do or how. The problem is actually doing it. 10 minutes a week is enough to know the priorities, and if there will be time to do anything in addition to them, but I don't do it.</div>

<div class="content">I ended up paying for an online support service, Focus Revolution, which primarily is online co-working space that additionally provides a bit of external structure and coaching to your hours. It proves to be a valuable tool to get me moving when I’m stuck.  It’s something I’ve needed since I lost access to the structure of a workplace.</div>

<div class="content">regarding "Order from Chaos: The Everyday Grind of Staying Organized with Adult ADHD"<br><br>Sounded interesting, figured I'd buy it on Kindle. It says I already bought it in Dec 2023. Check my kindle: 24% read. Dang. Ok it looks like I got bogged down by Rule #1 but Rule #2 is where the action begins.</div>

<div class="content">Not to derail the thread, but I just wanted to update that I finished Order from Chaos by listening to the audiobook and noting down any actionable items into a checklist in Google Keep. It is heavy on the GTD but I might go through the list I made later and see what I can put into action.</div>
