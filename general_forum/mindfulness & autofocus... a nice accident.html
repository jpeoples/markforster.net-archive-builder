<div class="content">In 2006, a friend and I participated in an 8 week MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction). After the course ended, and without external pressure to meditate, my practice went from 45 minutes a day, to zilch in less than two months.<br><br>AF 2 provides me with rules and a methodology to develop a MBSR mindset on a daily basis. When I follow the rules/list, I'm less prone to mindless activity. And this is true even if I engage in mindless activities i.e. web surfing. The simple act of adding "surf web" to my list increases my awareness that I'm goofing off. Which allows me to mindfully "goof off" without too much internal turmoil (or worse, unconscious business).  <br><br>Of course, I have "meditate" on my list as well. Perhaps the threat of dismissal will get me back on the cushion.</div>

<div class="content">The one rebellious behavior I am still engaging in is not writing down every online endeavor I am engaged in. Thanks for the reminder to do that. I think it will help.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>There are really no mindless activities. An explicit mindfulness practice helps you to be mindful not matter what you are doing. That is the upshot. I am glad that AF is allowing you to see this. Mark recently suggested a way to use AF to help me end a behavior I was engaging in. It reminded to be mindful of what I was doing and to give up on trying to stop th behavior and the behavior just fell away on its own.<br><br>I hope you find your way back to the cushion. I cannot think of any practice that has had more impact on my life than sitting and do nothing with intent. A help in keeping my practice strong is to do it within a group context once a week.<br><br>More unsolicited advice: jettison the talk of the unconscious. Worrying or wondering about that which we are not conscious of and its effects upon us not only smacks of superstition, but also seems to be a waste of time.<br><br>To that end, I highly recommend David Reynold's _Handbook for Constructive Living_. His appropriation of Moritan therapy fits well with a meditative / mindfulness practice and AF for that matter.<br><br>FWIW.<br><br><br><br></div>
