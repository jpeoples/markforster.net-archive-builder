<div class="content">This video, by YouTuber NetworkChuck, talks about an interesting project which will probably be of interest to posters in this forum. It's an open-source free framework for summarising and improving various factors in your life, linking in with journalling if you do that, and using an AI of your choice, private or public, to analyse it in various ways.<br><br>For example it can reveal bad habits, good habits, uncertainties, things causing anxiety, behaviours which are harming or helping, etc. It can make suggestions to fix problems, it can provide encouragement, suggest new areas of study, help resolve internal conflicts, help align behaviours and focus with long-term goals, and even help identify those goals, and so on.<br><br>It's ongoing if desired, so it can see your progress, or can be used in a specific way for some specific goals such as job-hunting. You don't need to journal anything but it gives the AI more info to work with.<br><br>The video explains how it all fits together and gives worked examples by the host himself, and the video description contains various links to the resources.<br><br>https://youtu.be/3BXE0e3QZ4U<br><br>For those who do maintain a journal, what do you think? It sounds like an interesting way to extract much more value from the work that goes into that and an example of AI's power being put to good use.<br><br>Regards,<br>Chris</div>
