<div class="content"><a href="http://www.markforster.net/expand-your-ideas/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/expand-your-ideas/</a><br><br>This post is showing up on the "Latest Changes" column as though it is a blog post, but it isn't formatted like a blog post, doesn't appear in the blog section, and doesn't permit comments.<br><br>At least, that's how it appears in my Firefox browser at 9:03 PM, 12/26/2011.<br><br>Just thought I'd mention it, since I was looking forward to reading any comments people may have made!   :-)</div>

<div class="content">I never noticed. :-)<br><br>It's not a blog post, it's a page, like the seminars page or the contact page. The changes section shows all changes to the website's content except comments and forum posts. So it shows blog posts and pages. Back when the systems overview page was still linked in the navigation bar, it too showed up in the changes section every time Mark added to it.<br><br>Now the question is, what happened here. Did Mark accidentally publish a page instead of a blog post, did he intend to publish it as a page, or didn't he intend to make it public at all. Maybe it is an draft for a future blog post which he saved as an unlinked page, unaware that it would appear in the changes section? :-)</div>

<div class="content">Turns out it's neither of those things.<br><br>It's a really old page, I tracked it back to November 2006: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061105025001/http://www.markforster.net/expand-your-ideas/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20061105025001/http://www.markforster.net/expand-your-ideas/</a><br><br>I like the old layout. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Comparing the last change tracked by archive.org with the current page, the only differences are the font of the heading and a single leading space before the first A that was removed. This might have triggered the page to appear in the changes list.</div>

<div class="content">I removed the advertisement which used to be on the page.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Ah, I missed that, probably because of my ad blocker.<br><br>Seraphim:<br><br>Mark republished that article as a blog post in 2008: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/8/4/expand-your-ideas-the-easy-way.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/8/4/expand-your-ideas-the-easy-way.html</a><br><br>But no one made any comments.</div>
