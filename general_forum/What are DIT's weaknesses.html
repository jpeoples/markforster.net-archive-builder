<div class="content">With many people favoring AF over DIT even though DIT was successful going by some a number of forum posts, I was wondering what the weak points of DIT are? In other words, in what area's and situations is DIT not as strong? <br><br>With the introduction AF it should give a bunch of people more contrast to go by.<br><br>Going to reread DIT for a bit<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter, I'm still wavering between AF and DIT. I used DIT successfully for well over a year but I do think that DIT is less flexible at dealing with tasks / projects etc. than is AF. I feel I have a bit more thinking time and breathing space with AF - ideas can germinate.  On the other hand, DIT is great for managing one's time and commitments realistically and sometimes I have doubts about how realistic one can be using AF...just a few thoughts. Maybe DIT is better in a role with lots of hard deadlines and accountability and AF is more effective with less hard deadlines and more discretionary time? I'm sure a few others will weigh in here!</div>

<div class="content">Hi<br>I love using the DITsystem set up as a weekly format . I make a small daily list based on items plucked from my weekly map and calendar appointments, events, and projects progress I also use the checklists to systemize the regular incoming stuff and recurring stuff.  I'm still loving the current initiative!  I can't rave about it enough!  LOL!  I timebox my modified version of Autofocus for tasks and events that don't require habitualization or being on a recurrent checklist.  I automate and streamline as much of this as I can.  The daily DIT didn't work for me.  The weekly scope gives me more mastery over planning and accomplishing my aims.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>oops!  I forgot to mention DIT's weaknesses.  The only one I can cite is that when used as a daily system, it seemed to take away my focus from my larger aims.  Now that I use it in a weekly format along with the projects keeping system and my checklists, it works quite well.  <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Mark has just done a brilliant post in the "My Biggest Problem with AF" thread about why AF works, and works for urgent items.   I loved DIT and found it to be the second best TM system ever.  Where it's weaknesses were for me (or more likely my weaknesses!) were (1) I found it hard to manage erratic discretionery time using DIT - if I had 10 things coming in a day and 7 hours to work one day but only 1 the next it made it very hard to balance according to the rules.  (2) I loved the Current Initiative concept but struggled to have just one.  However, if I am totally honest, whilst those were practical issues for me the fact is that I have never been able to consistently follow any system that required me to do things according to a list, day in and day out.  DIT worked far better than any previous system because of the choice of order of items which went a good part of the way towards the "freedom" I wanted but I always had those last few items .......</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine B<br>The Current Initiative is something you choose to action on everyday without fail.  You can have as many projects as you can handle!  LOL!  <br>I, too, found myself resenting my workload being based on work as it came in the day before much like I resent choosing my work from a list of items chosen on the fly!  LOL!<br>DIT in a weekly format..........just right!  <br>You stated <br>"but I always had those last few items ....... "<br>I turn it around and make them those FIRST few items.  I don't want those hairy toads on my list or on my mind any longer than necessary!   Kill them NOW!  ROTFL!

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>It just struck me from your above post that whereas my instinctive reaction is against being told when to do something yours seems to be more accepting of the "when" but resists the "what".  We both know that taks have to be done - if I can choose when, I am happy (therefore AF is perfect for me).  That's why I struggled to do everything on the list because when it came down to the last few items it was "you must do these NOW" , whereas for you it seems it was more related to "you must do THESE now".  Does that make sense?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-04-16 9:46</div>
<div class="content">Christine is pointing at DIT's biggest weakness: usually you should do everything that comes your way the next day, with exceptions of course. If you can't find the time you will have to rewrite things or constantly check if there are incomplete items on the previous days. This translates to a rather high maintenance of the system itself.<br><br>This is one of the big advantages of AF even if used as a paper system: you only rewrite things once you brought them forward in some way.<br><br>But these are all small points, in comparison both are very competent tools for managing your workload. Just check which one works best.</div>

<div class="content">Klaus:<br><br>In DIT I used to use the same system as the one I now use for AF: put a cross on a page if it is finished and put a circle round the cross if there are no active pages before it. That way you can see instantly whether there are any earlier items.<br><br>Bear in mind that in DIT your aim is to finish every task every day, so if a backlog exists for more than five days you should take that as a signal to carry out an audit (too much work? not working efficiently? not enough time?).</div>

<div class="meta">2009-04-16 11:08</div>
<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Good point. Now I see why you invent systems and I struggle to get them working ;-)<br><br>I always rewrote the tasks that didn't get completed. But this might be regarded as a way to punish myself for not finishing my stuff. Yet the fact that tasks are not tied to a specific day is one of the attractions of AF since it allows more flexibility.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-04-16 11:51</div>
<div class="content">Klaus:<br><br>It depends what you mean when you say "I always rewrote the tasks that didn't get completed". If you mean you re-entered them after doing some work on them, then that's perfectly ok. DIT supports a "little and often" approach in the same way as AF does.<br><br>If though you mean that you transferred tasks you hadn't started, then the danger of doing this is that you can't keep track of how many days backlog you have. You can keep track of this in other ways of course (such as a star system for every day you finish all your tasks), so it's not a huge problem. Re-writing the tasks can have the effect of impressing them on your mind, so there are positive things to be said for it as well.</div>

<div class="content">It was the second possibility. As probably most self employed will know the time available from one day to the next will vary enormously. As a result many items may even remain completely untouched. And sometimes there is nothing to be done e.g. when you needed to call someone during office hours and it is now 7 p.m. In these cases I did actually write the task on the page for the next day. And of course this also permitted me to spot items that were dragged along for any number of days, allowing me to analyze the why more closely.<br><br>This was exactly why I began to like AF from the beginning and why I suggested in another post to just put those things on the task diary that absolutely need to be done on that particular day. <br><br>But since you, Mark, and also Christine made such a strong point against mixing I am currently giving AF another go.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>Yes, you are correct.  I HATE scutwork!  LOL!  That's why I'm so hell bent on getting it over with ASAP.  LOL!  As long as it remains undone, it annoys my brain in the background even if I'm doing something I enjoy.  If I get rid of it, I free up my mind and my focus.  I like DIT as a weekly focus, because I can implement my 90 minute scutwork cap daily with planning not as the work trickled in yesterday.  Somehow my knowing that putting my nose to the grindstone for only 90 minutes for the distateful work, gave me impetus to knock it out fast to clear the way for the more challenging and enjoyable stuff.  DIT in a daily format could have me facing entire days of scutwork if that's how it flowed in.  My way chunks it down methodically into doable bits.  <br>I envy you.  I think it's probably easier to maintain mastery over WHEN than WHAT!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Klaus:<br><br>People indeed have varying amounts of time each day, which is why I allowed a 4 or 5 day "grace period" in DIT to catch up with each day's incoming work. Of course if you are away from your desk, you are unlikely to be adding more items to your list, so hopefully the day that you don't get much done will be followed by a day in which there won't be many tasks scheduled.</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>I guess we'll just have to form a Mutual Envy Society :-)  I envy your ability to be disciplined to DO those things you hate!!<br><br>It is only those outside influences that would make me do something - cleaning as such was never a really major problem - sharing a house with a medical student many moons ago was enough of an incentive (I had never realised coffee grew mold until then!).  However, the fact that the dead plants on my balcony (which I had meant to address but have to confess had not even made it as far as my lists - shock horror!) have developed a urgency in that all balconies have had to be cleared to be repainted.  Dead plants (and the thought of their accompanying friends) sitting in my living room has proved to be a good motivator! :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>That did not hold true for me with DIT as most of my workflow in was not dependent upon my location at my desk.  Post, email etc continued relentlessly!  AF works much better from the number of new tasks scenario - if I am not at my desk I definitely add less tasks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Klaus<br><br>I had tried virtually every Time Management system and variation thereon prior to AF.  I even created my own systems, many of which worked fairly well for me but none that "had it all" like AF.<br><br>The system I was working pre AF was one of my own creations and had a lot of similarities to AF.  It too worked on the basis of a series of closed lists, each of 25 items. I could choose any five items from the first list before moving on to the next and so on.  Where it fell down was that I had separate sets of lists for each type of task, and at the end of the week I rolled all the lists up into new lists of 25.  It got stuff done but I was always left with the high resistance items and was frequently bored.  The way AF is written is WHY it works - anything that is "less than" pure AF (like my system or any system that qualifies tasks) does not have the same result.  Neither does anything that is "more than" pure AF (such as a DIT or GTD hybrid).  AF just is as it is.<br><br>Good luck with retrying it ...........................:-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine B<br>Environmental cueing is actually my favorite way to go when I'm off the clock.  I'll do things such as place the recyclables by the front door to notice when I next walked my dog or sometimes I'll write something on my bathroom mirror.

<div class="content">Re Christine: <br>the words of fundamentalist hehe! I'm just joking. I think 'pure AF' is the best at getting AF like results. But you can't really think about productivity, time management, self management, energy management, project management, task management or whatever you want to call it from purely one system's standpoint. <br><br>At least not in practice. I mean, we do all use a calendar, that is a system in itself. You can't not have a hybrid in some shape or form. <br><br>So apart from people's personalities and workstyles being different, I think people 's results from doing 'pure af' are always going to be different on the case-by-case level, simply because we each have our own motivation strategies, tactics, methods and circumstances that come into play, if we have labeled it a system or not.  No matter how to the letter we follow the rules of a system. <br><br>That sort of makes the idea of pure AF a bit more tentative, which I think is good because I always think there is a better way, at least on an individual level. It's that belief that improves systems. <br><br>Does coffee really get moldy?</div>

<div class="content">Having reread the DIT book the other day I have to say it is a very very solid approach. I would put AF ahead of it in terms of effectiveness, even though I haven't done pure DIT (I did have many elements of it incorporated into my own practices before finding the book).<br><br>The interesting thing about AF is probably that you don't really need a book to explain it for  it to get the maximum effects. It's very elegant that way. I do think with all it's flexibility it's shortcomings become increasingly apparent the less discretionary time you have. <br><br>And with DIT, I think having a good feeling for the principles is a major advantage, from a general life perspective too. Commitment vs interests for example is a classic chapter for me. <br><br>so Learning as you go, what precisely do you do for a weekly DIT approach vs Daily? I don't think I got a fully clear picture. I do say, I think one of GTD's hallmarks is the weekly review. It gives that sense of control and direction that is gleaned from understanding the tasks and how they fit into the bigger picture. With AF I think most of the sense of control is derived from the experience and trust in the system.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter<br><br><<I think 'pure AF' is the best at getting AF like results.>><br>Errm - aren't we trying to get AF like results...? :-)<br><br>AF is a system - it is not the only system as you say but has to maintain it's integrity to work effectively.  A calendar can be in different formats but it still has to have the right number of months and days and in the right order.

<div class="content">Hi Peter<br>I concur with you about the value of a weekly review.  It's a tool to help us meet our responsibilites , and live our passions and it also helps us to stay on our chosen trajectories of  intentional living.  Jacqueline and I discussed how our meta values are the driving force of both our planning and decision making and how we choose to live out our lives.  The post also has a link to a pdf called the Freelances Worksheet that looks remarkably like mine.  Without droning on......The forum topic is called Interesting TM/productivity articles. The URL is:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/708979" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/708979</a><br><br>I discuss a bit how my DIT version is a bit different from the pdf. version.<br>The url is<br><a href="http://www.productiveflourishing.com/wp-content/uploads/The_Freelancer_Workweek_-_Draft.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.productiveflourishing.com/wp-content/uploads/The_Freelancer_Workweek_-_Draft.pdf</a><br><br>It's serves me quite well!  I see no need to deviate from my system because it works brilliantly for what I want of myself and my life.  I think it keeps me in the sweet spot of both accomplishing my aims and allowing me the flexibility to live my life as it unfolds both by my chosen trajectory and it's unexpected opportunities.  Bottom line: It's about upholding/building my character and my lifestyle.  I only pray that the two impact positively within my humble sphere of influence.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">The easiest way to do a review (weekly or otherwise) is to put it as a task in AF, e.g. "Review Projects" or however you like to phrase it. That way it will be carried out when you feel it's needed rather than when the calendar says it's due.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Those "review" type tasks are so valuable and the flexibility of when they can be actioned is so much better than a fixed review time when it can then just become a chore.  By actioning a review "when it stands out" it means that you are in the right frame of mind to review rather than just read!</div>

I end up doing a weekly review every Sunday and I look forward to those simply because the Mondays always feel like a fresh start and the Sunday allows me to organize my thoughts, look around and so on.<br><br>I have used AF items like 'think about x' and so forth. I added items like 'process/system improvement' where I just think about how I can improve certain things on different topics. <br> <br>I have read DIT twice now, the first time was just over a year ago I think, that's when I found the site.

<div class="content">Learning, I was just searching for your description of how you do weekly DIT and found this thread. I love the idea of having weekly goals, though I don't function well with too much scheduling/ time blocking. I guess my question is, how do you handle the new things that come up? Are you careful as per DIT to only add tasks to your week that REALLY need to be done this week and not next week? The only thing is I wonder if I would get confused using this approach. I would need a separate list I guess and add it to my regular AF list? The AF method of working is really the only thing that has helped me long-term. I have been ill and I am not panicking about a giant backlog. I do feel I need some goals though to keep me focused.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>I failed miserable with AF so I can't offer any decent advice.  There isn't too much scheduling.  It's beauty is that it's actually quite flexibile.  I project my aims and plug them in.  This week's incoming only gets done this week if it's importance or urgency trumps last week's queque.  I'm regimented only where necessary!

<div class="content">p.s.  I am primarily guided by visualizations and it's kinesthetic components, not words or sequential steps.  Of course, time marches sequentially, but my visualization guides the sequence of my actions as I attempt to replicate what's in my brain into reality.  Flylady's lists scared me.  When I clean, I'm matching my mental representation of a ship shape room (along with smells, textures, etc) to my "real room" by my actions.....same principle as painting, playing music, writing stories, etc.....we're simply juxtaposing our mental world with what is in our reality and our actions attempt to bridge the gap.

My neuropsychological testing (because of brain injures) revealed that my highest cognitive functioning is abstract reasoning  Conversely,  I rated mildly retarded for list recall........<br>My list aversion isn't preference or prejudice, it's anatomic predispostion caused by brain injuries (or simply made it far worse..  *blush* )<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning, I've done a rotation in neuropsych and considered a specialization because I really enjoyed that work. As a junior high student, I had an educational psychologist tell me that I had brain damage and would never be an engineer. In order to overcome her stupid prophesy, I considered becoming an engineer, but then realized that it made more sense to become a psychologist. ;-)<br><br>My learning style is such that a map makes little sense to me, but verbal directions work beautifully. That's why I enjoy lists. Last night I made a list of goals for the week. This felt very satisfying to me. I then added "Weekly Goals" to my AF list. I am excited to work on these. I think it will work! I don't think the issue of adding a new weekly goal to the list from this week's incoming will be there for me as if it's an urgent task, it will just get added to my standard AF list. <br><br>I so appreciate your strength of spirit and willingness to share what works for you.

Perhaps, your gratitude might be the value of working smarter, not harder as even MORE precious when you're well......then you have both the opportunity AND the ability!  I crank out my work no matter what to stay current........but the prime pay off is on those rare occasions where my pain has abated enough to allow me dive into life head first.....not to have time to tend to my pain.....that will happen anyway.......It feels like the seas have parted when those precious rare occurances of less pain spontaneously occur!   It's like the biblical scene....yet experienced viscerally as well!  LOL!   Who wants to miss out on ANY miracle of their life because they are chained to postponed mundane crap?  ROTFL!!!!   My miracles might be far less grand than watching Moses.......but, they are my miracles non the less!   Most aren't actually miracles at all....they are gratitudes.  They feel identical....so I chose to regard them as such!  LOL!<br><br>Hi Peter K<br>Thanks for your kind words.  I love how words seem to act as incantations so that we can share our inner lives through metaphor.... I truly love the experiences the people in this forum invoke in me both intellectually and emotionally.  What I can't get from my actual life.....I find here.  The social afffiliation here protects me from the mental breakdown that isolation creates.  This groups is keeping me sane.....or relatively saner!  *blush* ROTFL  ROTFL ROTFL<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>There are lots of holes in my thinking/memory so I tend to leave out things.  I apologize if my following statement threw you off the beam.....<br><br>"This week's incoming only gets done this week if it's importance or urgency trumps last week's queque. "<br><br>If the current incoming is easily done piece meal or in a batch and it doesn't hog up your resources (time and effort) at the expense of your important stuff in the queque, then by all means, do it.  The purpose of my weekly format is to allow for reasonable flexibility within the scope of meeting my aims.  Sometimes the flexibility even allows for a bit of not so reasonable stuff as well!  ROTFL!  So long as I stay on my trajectory and meet my projected aims, all is good enough in VickieLand!  ROTFL!  This system embraces my strengths and accomdates my short-comings allowing me to live in a modicum of grace (that's what I'm hoping for anyway.........Some folks might dispute that claim!  ROTFL!<br><br>Get better soon, Mel!  <br>learning as I go</div>
