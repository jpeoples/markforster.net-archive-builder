<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Don't get me wrong Mark, I think that AF/SF/DWM are one excellent family of time management systems.  However, I think these systems have made my will very weak, because although these systems actually do not promote it, they have little or no provision to prevent or lessen doing what I WANT to do instead of doing what I NEED to do, because of the "standing out" process in choosing tasks.<br><br>Now the recent articles on exercising one's will and prioritization by urgency made me think.  If I have to strengthen my will, then I have to change how I choose my tasks in the list.  "Standing out" makes it too easy to be abused.  Colley's rule is good.  However, I also want to use the "prioritization by urgency" paradigm as introduced by Mark Forster, and Colley's rule I found to not fit this.<br><br>I then realized, well, if prioritization by urgency is by determining when a task should be started, then what if I determine which tasks should be started NOW, and then do them? I realized the criterion "Should I Start It Now?" does not care whether a task is trivial, difficult or easy, but cuts right to the chase of determining which tasks NEED to be done NOW.  It is thus a very good criterion for a time management system that aims to strengthen one's will.  On the other hand, since the question asks if one should START the task, not DO (i.e. finish) it, the question promotes "little and often" and also lowers the resistance somewhat.<br><br>----<br><br>Materials: Pen, Notebook<br><br>I. Start of the day<br>___1. Mark the beginning of the day with a horizontal line at the end.  List all your new tasks after this line.<br>___2. Delete all undone tasks more than 7 days old.<br>___3. From the start of the list, ask for each task the question: "Should I Start It Now?" If no, leave the task as is; if yes, mark the task with a dot. Do this until up to the end of the list.<br><br>II. Working the list<br>___1. Go back to the beginning of the list and process each task as follows<br>______a. If the task is unmarked, ask the question: "Should I Start It Now?" If no, leave the task as is; if yes, mark the task with a dot. <br>______b. If the task is marked with a dot, START IT (not necessarily finish it) NOW.  Work on the task as long as needed, then delete the task.  Rewrite at the end of the list as needed but unmarked.<br><br>TIP: If you realize that you need to do something else before your current marked task, MARK with a dot the task you need to do before this task (write it at the end of the list if needed), then DELETE and REWRITE the marked task task at the end of the list marked with a dot. <br><br>___2. Once you reach the end of the list, go back to the beginning of the list and work the list as above.<br>___3. You have ended your day when all dotted tasks are done and you cannot mark any more tasks.<br><br>-----<br><br>As you all can see, this is one very simple system.  I am currently using it and I think it is quite effective.  Some observations:<br><br>___1.  It really forces me to use my will, but I can also add easier tasks especially if I feel the NEED for relaxation and recreation, BUT the system ensures I must do what I need to do BEFORE I can relax.  <br>___2.  It very simply yet elegantly solves the problem of what to do with tasks that are on the list but I cannot do them yet.  This makes the system one excellent "grasscatcher".<br>___3.  It clearly yet simply gives a sense of accomplishment since it clearly denotes when one's day is done.<br>___4.  Of course, this system handles urgent tasks quite well ^___^<br>___5.  One can easily extract a smaller list to be used on errands, and then process the smaller list in the same way.<br>___6.  All tasks, whether new, recurring, or unfinished, are worked the same way, but are all still effectively handled</div>

<div class="content">My experience with AF/etc has been the opposite -- I feel I have a much better ability to set aside resistance and just start now, on things that really matter.   And I think AF and the standing out and dismissal processes have really helped with developing that ability.<br><br>For me, "standing out" has almost come to mean "do I really need to do this today, or can it wait?"    I cycle through everything, and move everything that stands out to my TODAY list.  Then I just cycle through that till its done.   Then start over by cycling through everything new and everything that's still left over.<br><br>Sometimes there are some tasks that probably DO need to be started today, or at least soon, but I still resist them -- but that's almost always because there is already such a huge pile of OTHER things that ALSO need to be started today.   And this is my intuition telling me, "Yes, it's important, but it can wait."<br><br>I guess what I am trying to say is that the AF/etc process has really helped me develop a better intuitive idea of what really needs to be done NOW -- the "standing out" process has become more and more refined.   I tend to think it has happened by design, not by chance.</div>

<div class="content">I like numtym's idea.  I shall try this at home.<br><br>I agree with Seraphim that "stands out" really needs to be more about what needs doing than what you want to do.</div>

<div class="content">The need-vs-want issue reminded me of this old article:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/2/15/the-four-quadrants-a-different-version.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/2/15/the-four-quadrants-a-different-version.html</a><br><br>The conclusion is great:  "Then to the right of the items put two columns HAVE TO DO? and WANT TO DO? Then tick each item in the relevant columns. Challenge yourself fiercely about whether each item really needs to be done or not.  You then do the items which have a tick only the first column. And only when you’ve finished them do you do the items which have ticks in both columns.  And then go home!"<br><br>Of course, the best of all possible worlds is getting to the situation where everything that needs doing is something one really does want to do.</div>

<div class="content">I'd add one extra feature to ubi's idea: Will I want do it (enjoy doing it) later today?<br><br>If shoveling the driveway is first on the list (has to be done, don't want to do it) according to ubi's rules I should do it first. Yet if I wait until after lunch it will be warmer out.<br><br>It depends on how well I can predict my own wants and behaviour. If I know I'll do it after lunch, it can wait. On the other hand, if I know that after lunch I'll sit down with a book and cup of tea, then I should get it over with now.<br><br>In the other direction, sometimes I want to do it, so those rules mean I should do it after the "have, don't want to". However, later in the day, when those are done, this task might not look so enticing. In that case, the rule works -- it's now a "have, don't want to", so still gets done, but I could have done it earlier. There's no extra points for doing things you don't want to do, only for getting them done.<br><br>As before, it depends on how well you know yourself. It might work well to do it now while you're interested, but it might become a way to put off other things.</div>

<div class="content">This is why many have a problem with TM.  They are looking for a system to choose what they do, when most of us intuitively know what "needs" to get done.  No TM system will actually make you do what is important.  This is why we all know lots of wildly successful people who appear not to use a traditional TM system but are very successful.  Usually these people work on the impactful things in their lives.  Great topic<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Thinking more about "will want to" and "won't want to".<br><br>"I will want to later" is too easy to abuse. Only use it if you really will be better able to do it later. That can include knowing from experience that you really will feel like doing it at a specific future time.<br><br>Perhaps it should be the more objective "best done at a specific time" and "best done now". Then be ruthless when that time comes -- do it. The time can be a clock or event time. Also consider what happens if something comes up between now and then -- you might decide it really is best done now.<br><br>"I won't want to do it later" is harder to abuse. You're still doing something important. The only danger is doing it instead of something more important.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>@Alan, Seraphim: I fully agree that \\\"standing out\\\" was meant to choose what was needed to do, rather than what we want to do.  However, even Mark has admitted there are problems with this method: <br><br>\\\"An associated problem with SuperFocus/AutoFocus is that there is a tendency for the list to get packed with easy tasks which give an illusion of progress. What is actually happening though is that the easy tasks on a page get dealt with quickly, while the more difficult tasks only get dealt with a few at a time.\\\"  --- <a href="../blog/A good question.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2012/2/8/a-good-question.html</a><br><br>@ubi: The article that actually directly inspired me to do this system (I think I shall call it SISIN) was this article: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/9/three-types-of-urgent.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/9/three-types-of-urgent.html</a>  I wanted to make a TM system that more or less makes the person work like the orderly person illustrated there.<br><br><<Of course, the best of all possible worlds is getting to the situation where everything that needs doing is something one really does want to do. >>  Actually I am finding that using SISIN <<IS>> the best of all possible worlds: as I build confidence in doing what I previously wanted to avoid, I am starting to ENJOY exercising my will in doing whatever task I am doing.  I can see that now my emotions and passions are getting more and more under control, my will is getting more and more backbone, even my intuition is getting more and more clear as it is getting less and less clouded by my wants and distractions.  Even the fear of failure I have in starting difficult tasks is sometimes being replaced now kinda like the thrill of gambling, in which the thrill is in the fact that I might win or I might lose.<br><br>@Cricket: Hence the question \\\"Should I Start It Now?\\\"  With regards to the shoveling snow, I would have surmised it would be better to start doing the shoveling later when it's warmer.  <br><br>And no I do not agree with adding \\\"want\\\" or \\\"enjoy\\\" into the equation.  You see, in this system, I find ways to enjoy what I am doing, instead of finding things to do that I enjoy.<br><br><<Perhaps it should be the more objective \\\"best done at a specific time\\\" and \\\"best done now\\\". Then be ruthless when that time comes -- do it. The time can be a clock or event time. Also consider what happens if something comes up between now and then -- you might decide it really is best done now.>><br><br>A very good way of explaining the philosophy of SISIN.  <br><br><<\\\"I won't want to do it later\\\" is harder to abuse. You're still doing something important. The only danger is doing it instead of something more important. >><br><br>Wow, you're right.  I'll keep that in the backburner ^___^<br><br>@Gerry: You are right.  However, many of us are not like you who seem to have a good grasp of what is important to do at the right time, hence you just need a way of consolidating all the important data you might need later.  We, on the other hand, need some trainer wheels first to get there ^___^</div>

<div class="content">nuntym,<br><<I don't know what's the deal with the backslash with each quotation mark :/>><br><br>It looks like the system is trying to escape the quotes. Some sort of editing mode must have changed in Mark's settings (or Squarespace "upgraded" something), most likely related to displaying inline markup. Quotes turn into backslash-quotes, and if you edit the post afterward, both the backslash and the quote get escaped again, resulting in three backslashes. If you were to edit the post several times, the backslashes would probably multiply exponentially!<br><br><br>Interesting SISIN system, nuntym. I'm not ready for another experiment, but I'll watch how this works out for you.<br><br><br>(... a minute later ...)<br><br>Well, look at that! No backslashes in my post. I guess it's fixed.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>@Bernie: Yeah, looks like it's fixed! :)  And for now, SISIN is doing very well.<br><br>@Cricket: Actually I was thinking of St. Paul: "Rejoice always, give thanks in all circumstances" and all that stuff.  Great minds like them think alike, I guess  :)<br><br>@Alan: How's your trial of SISIN going?<br><br>----<br><br>Anyways, a few days of using the system revealed to me a much easier way of some minor ordering of the marked tasks: If one task is particularly more urgent than the rest, then you just have to DELETE it then REWRITE at the end of the list MARKED with a dot.</div>
