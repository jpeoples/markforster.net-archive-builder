<div class="content">These days my weapon of choice is FVP. But I also stuck a long time with Simple Scanning before. But with both of those systems (and any system really) the tasks that I don't really want to do get left behind as the list grows for many pages. <br>The solution has been starting a new list, and the previously-left-behind tasks either go away or are managed better in a shorter list.<br><br>I've been entertaining the idea of a Do Everything method:<br>- It's a long list method.<br>- You enter any and all tasks that come to mind at any time, at the end of the list.<br>- You process each task one at a time, in order.<br>- If the task Stands Out (it's urgent, it's important, it's fun, whatever), you work on it for as long as you want.<br>- If the task doesn't Stand Out (it's boring, there are more urgent/important things to do, can't really make any progress, waiting for input from someone, etc.), you STILL work on it, for at least one minute.*<br>- You cross out the task. If there is more work to do on it, enter it at the end of the list.<br>- Continue to the next task.<br><br>* Some notes on this:<br>1- You don't have to set a timer, just what feels like one minute (as a minimum) is OK. The point is to do SOMETHING, however minimal it is.<br>2- There are many reasons for a task not standing out:<br>a) It's boring / I don't feel like doing it. You still force yourself to make some progress. After all, it's only one minute, what's the bare minimum you could do? Do that.<br>b) There are more urgent things to do. If it's something like a meeting, something that has a set starting time in less than a minute, then drop everything and go to your appointment. If not, then don't worry, just work on the task at hand for a minute, the urgent stuff will still be there waiting for you.<br>c) There are more important things to do. Just like in the previous point, don't worry, just work on the task at hand for a minute (or faster if you can!), the important stuff will still be there waiting for you.<br>d) Can't make progress right now. Find _something_ that you can do. You could gather the papers in preparation, put them in a folder. You could mentally visualize how the task is going to go, and then make some notes. You could rehearse what you're going to say. You could google it for more information. You could trace the route you're going to take. You could make a mental/written checklist to see if everything is ready.<br>e) Waiting for someone. Again, find something that you can do. You could send a friendly reminder. Instead of waiting for them, you go to them. You could prepare (and doublecheck) everything on your end. Etc.<br>f) Sure, but one minute is too little to make any progress. Find something minimal. Taking a page from GTD's book: defining purpose and principles, outcome visioning, brainstorming, organizing, and identifying next actions is still progress.<br>3- If after one minute of thinking about how to make progress nothing comes up, well then maybe that was the work done for this round.<br>4- Hopefully those tasks that don't really belong on my list get discarded after thinking about them for a minute or two.<br><br>Disclaimer: I haven't really tried this method, and most of what's here I've fleshed out while writing this post.<br><br>Has anyone tried anything like this before?<br><br>Maybe I'll give it a try this week and report back.</div>

<div class="content">Arturo - <br><br>Your rules remove one of the problems (friction) that I've had with a lot of Mark's systems. Mainly, when I need to decide to do/defer etc., I get tripped up by my own resistance. However I think your "If it's on the list, you need to do something for one minute" rule removes one more decision that I have to make regarding this task/project/goal. It's "little and often" to the power of 3..<br><br>I'd imagine if one could stick to this system, you'd quickly weed out everything that is a no go task/project, while making  progress on items that are truly important to you (or need to get done). Moreover, a few weeks of doing this, the list itself would have a narrative of sorts i.e. This is the type of person that I am... what I stand for. <br><br>I really like this, and might give it a shot. <br><br>Can you envision doing this a la M. Forster i.e. Throwing everything at the list, and living off the list. For example: <br><br>Watch Netflix drama<br>Respond to Email<br>Write blog post<br>Buy milk<br><br>Or do you envision using this system whenever you have discretionary time, or between certain hours?</div>

<div class="content">I like the way you have articulated this.  I've been toying with improving the dismissal algorithm by at a minimum rewriting the task with new clarifying words or smaller steps.  <br><br>Or if it is an item is no longer relevant I ask myself, what was the intent of this? If the "why" is still there but the "how" has changed I possibly do some work on changing how the "how" is written.  <br><br>For example if the task was to "research buying a new camera" and I no longer feel inclined to do so, I may ask myself why did I want a new camera?  If the "why" was because I was heading out on a recreational trip and wanted to take a few nicer pictures. I may realize that due to COVID,  taking a trip is more difficult and the real task  might actually be to  research ways to get some recreation in a different sort of way.  <br><br>Completely different task but same core why.</div>

<div class="content">Arturo M:<br><br><< Has anyone tried anything like this before? >><br><br>Yes, this or something very like it was one of my earliest systems.<br><br>Since I'm no longer using it, you can guess that I had problems with it.<br><br>My system basically was to write down everything I had to do and then do it in order. As new things came up or old things needed re-entering they went at the end of the list. I think that's very similar to what you are proposing.<br><br>The problem is that if people draw up a list like that, they will almost certainly have more than a day's work in it. By which I mean that if they work on everything in the list in order without adding anything it will take them more than a day to get through it. Many active people have at least a week's worth.<br><br>So, if you add a task "Contact M. re this weekend's conference", the conference will have come and gone before you get round to making the call. Ok, so you make an exception. But there are an awful lot of tasks with similar or greater urgency. So you make exceptions for all of them. And before you know it you are spending the day making exceptions and nothing which isn't urgent is getting done,<br><br>Even worse, you have a project which you can't do in one go, you work on it for an hour, decide you've done enough for today and re-enter it at the end of the list. A week later you arrive at what was the end of the list and have to pick up the threads, most of which have gone stale in the interval.<br><br>I've tried to get round this in many ways. Two of the most effective ones are the system described in "Do It Tomorrow" which uses three degrees of priority which are each treated differently, and GIRKIR in which tasks are only introduced gradually into the list so that you get each task right in turn and then keep it right.</div>

<div class="content">I often will set a timer and work on something for only one minute.  This is usually at the start of the day or the start of a work session.  I use it as a warmup to get going.  If I have a list of items, 10 works well, I might spend 1 minute on each.    Some items that only need to be checked can get done in one minute.   Sometimes, after one minute, I realize I don't need to do the task, or don't want to do it.  <br><br>However, there is a limit to how many items and for how long I can do this. Perhaps no more than a half hour, or no more than 10 items.  Eventually my mind will rebel at working for that short a time. If I work for one minute on a task,  and want to work longer on it, I set the timer for 2 minutes, and keep increasing it the longer I want to work.  Usually I work toward a minimum of 5 minutes on a task.  At some point, I get lost in the task, and forget to set the timer.  By then, I see which task needs the most time, and abandon the timer altogether, just like you discard the scaffolding when it has served its purpose.  It is like warming up before exercise.  It is not the main event, only the prelude. <br>Working for one minute is of value, but I don't think it will get one through every item on the list. <br>Eventually, you'll reach the point when there are more tasks than there is time for.  Many tasks cannot be completed in a minute.  Working for one minute keeps the task on the list longer.  <br>If one has 60 items, and spend one minute on each, it will at most take 60 minutes to go through all of them.  If each takes 5 minutes it will take 5 hours.  However, not all tasks require 5 minutes.  On the other hand, many tasks will take longer than 5 minutes.  <br>Timeboxing in these short intervals of time gets to be fatiguing.</div>

<div class="content">Only if the list is very short can one work on every item.  I do try to do this sometimes with a list of 10 or 20 items. <br>Working on a task for one minute is valuable on tasks that one is procrastinating on, that you don't want to do, but have to do, and is urgent.  Sometimes you don't feel like doing something until you get started doing it.  Sometimes all that is required is a minute or two of your time and the task is done.  Sometimes all it takes is getting started and the inertia leaves.  <br>Unfortunately, some procrastination items take longer than one minute.  Sometimes I will work on a task for one minute, and then sit and do nothing.  If I want to work for 2 minutes, I do that, but if not I stay at one minute.  I keep this up.  Usually at some point I either finish the task, or forget to reset the timer and continue with the task, or get so tired of being forced to restrict myself to the timer that I dispense with it.  This is only a crutch, but it works sometimes.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps the question: Do YOU think this will work - is the wrong question for ME. My greatest achievements to date had nothing to do with time blocking, productivity software or any identifiable system per se. Most happened in accountability to one other person (Therapist, filmmaker friend, publisher) and a hard deadline. <br><br>Because I have young kids (and hard deadline appointment with clients), a lot of my day is already structured. The Achilles' Heel for me is discretionary time. What is the best way to use that time when minus accountability and a hard deadline? It's a conundrum. <br><br>I can only assume Mark (and most on this forum) has different priorities and scheduling than me. Perhaps one day, some sort of AI will be able to input an individual's motivation, stage in life, etc., etc., and pump out a productivity workflow system specifically designed to for that individual. Until then, I guess we need to experiment, tweak, and experiment some more. To that end, I'm left wondering: Does Artuor's rules work for me? A follow up question: Do these rules support - or detract or overly complicate - the current system that I'm currently using?</div>

<div class="content">I do this with AF. When I get to a page that nothing stands out, I say (usually to myself, sometimes to my cat) I say to myself "Is there anything left that I would be willing to spend at least five minutes on today?" If no, the items on the page get dismissed.</div>

Still, it would be interesting to know the context of a productivity author/coach's life when they created their system. David Allen never had kids... could that detail explain - what some believe is - an overly complex productivity system. Etc. etc.</div>

<div class="content">A "Do everything" method might work if it uses a short list of items that must-be-done today.  <br>Or must-do before leaving for work, or preparing for a meeting.</div>

Whether that will be a blog post or a further comment in this thread, I don't yet know.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>To start at the end, this blog is a retirement project and so it's independent of any current paid work involvements. Which is not to say that there isn't any work - there's lots - but it's stuff that I've taken on voluntarily and do from home. And for most of it, it's up to me what I make of it. <br><br>That is reflected in the systems which I've put forward through the blog. What I've been aiming for have been systems which work in any environment in which you care to put them. They must be flexible and respond well to the whims of the person operating them. The ideal system for me would be one which one which I can use for both work and leisure, and which I could even take on holiday with me as well as using it for serious work.<br><br>I'll write some more about this later, and this time I'll start from the other end. What made me get into time management in the first place? and what were my circumstances when I wrote Get Everything Done?</div>

<div class="content">The results after (almost) a week of trying this method are that I've been working more productivelly on my personal tasks, but it hasn't make much difference for my professional tasks.<br><br>But first I'll address the question directed to me:<br><br>avrum:<br><< Can you envision doing this a la M.

I have an overall system for myself. Something like an outter "life-management" system.<br>This is a system more for my discretionary time, and for work hours.<br><br><br>As it's obvious, and as some of you pointed out, the main weaknesses of "Do Everything" are:<br>1) Long list of tasks.<br>2) Urgent tasks. (Even worse when this is combined with the previous point).<br>3) Mental strain.<br><br>I have subconciously combatted all of those weaknesses this week, and I intend to make it explicit starting tomorrow.<br>The solution that seems to work for me is:<br>- "Tickler file", "Waiting for" and "Someday/maybe" lists, and<br>- Work-Rest-Work-Rest cycles (a la Pomodoro Technique). <br><br><br>All in all, I really like this system. Maybe it's the honeymoon phase, but I really like it so far.<br>I'm gonna be sticking to this until the next big thing.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>To continue my comments on my situation when I produced my books... my first point is that my situations differed a lot for each book which might tend to validate your point.<br><br>My first book "Get Everything Done" was written when I was in employment as a a fundraiser for the local diocese of the Anglican Church. This covered the English counties of East and West Sussex, including Brighton & Hove, which is now a unitary authority but was then part of East Sussex. So a relatively big area with something like 250 churches - all needing me to tell them how to get their finances straight!<br><br>This involved a vast amount of work including a huge amount of travel within Sussex. My wife was also working and at the start we had three children living at home, which was down to one by the end. I was working from home and only went into my official office when necessary. <br><br>And to add to all after ten years of that I had decided that I was tired of raising money for other people and wanted to do it for myself. So I was training to be a Life Coach in my spare time, which was a completely new profession in those days in this country. A new profession needs organizing, so I stared organizing that too!<br><br>The publication of the book more or less coincided with my giving up my job and starting to work full-time for myself. My income didn't even dip, and I was soon earning far more than I had when employed.<br><br>Next instalment follows.</div>

<div class="content">Arturo:<br><br><<The solution that seems to work for me is:>><br><br>I like this line. Me... not you. Within that spirit, my entire system revolves around a daily journal. The goal is to create an ongoing narrative of my life that - hopefully - evolves into lessons learned, goals accomplished, etc. It also has to be aesthetically pleasing, and searchable. Currently, I do all of that in Pages (Mac). But during the day, I use pen/paper. <br><br>Outside of hard landscape appointments (Clients, pick up kids from camp, etc), I either go with my intuition vis-a-vis "What is the best use of my time right now". I jot that down, and try to do it. Or if my brain is foggy, I create an on-the-fly Scatter Map (Mark's idea), and choose one item from the map to work on. Wash/repeat.</div>

If you're willing, would be curious to know what you borrowed, learned, repurposed or rejected from your family of origin that led to your workflow systems. Was your father a procrastinator? A hard worker? What about your mom? Did they have any list making system to speak of?<br><br>The above might be too personal, and I understand if you'd prefer to not go there.</div>

In fact it would never have occurred to me that they had any system. They just did what everyone did in those days. In other words there was nothing to distinguish what my parents did from what anyone else's parents did or how they did it - not that a child would be aware of at least.<br><br>We are talking about the 1940s and 50s here. The difference in people's day-to-day lives then from what they are today was enormous. We were still under wartime rationing. Foreign travel was almost non-existent. A "phone" was an enormous black bakelite thing which put you through to an operator. Calls abroad had to be booked in advance. We were the first in our street to get a television (and had to invite the whole street to watch the Coronation in black and white). The only recorded music was on 78s.<br><br>Even when I finally made it into an office in the early 60s, to write an official letter I had to write it out in longhand, give it to a typist, who then produced it for my signature (usually after I had sent it back a couple of time for errors to be corrected).  I could go on and on.<br><br>The point being that life was much more rigid in those days and there was much less choice about what one could do. The concept of "time management" itself hardly existed.<br><br>And I would go back there without a second's consideration if I had the choice.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><<I'm not conscious of having borrowed, learned, repurposed or rejected anything in particular from my parents time-management-wise.>><br><br>For me, two things stick out that led to my quirky interest in systems, tools, etc: <br><br>1. When I was 6 or 7, I recall sitting next to my father as he opened his mail. He would do this every night, and let me sit next to him. I remember this being a special time, for me anyway. He'd give me the junk mail to open, but I remember thinking it was anything but junk. I mean, it was addressed to my dad. In an attempt to mimic my father, I saved some of the fake credit cards (the cardboard type... to sample what your actual card would like) placed them in my kid wallet. <br><br>2. In my mid-20s, watching the family business go bankrupt, and my father spiral into a depression. That experience left it's mark, and I too became very anxious about work, money, etc. In the early 2000s, a friend suggested 7 Habits to help me better manage my anxiety, and work life. Those were glorious days... reading about systems, goals, etc. It seemed to be (one of) the factors that was missing from my father (and mother's) ability to plan their lives, and regulate their anxiety.<br><br>These formative positive and negative experiences created an itch, that was somewhat soothed when I discovered Covey's ideas. And I've been tweaking and experimenting ever since.</div>

<div class="content">Coming to this thread belatedly... Mark’s Randomizer system—which I’ve been trying again over the past few weeks—seems relevant here. The Randomizer is also a “do everything” system. It has a vague family resemblance to what Arturo is proposing: you MUST work on every task (that the system selects) even if it’s only for a couple of minutes. Though random selection avoids some of the problems of FIFO… the Randomizer may well select an important recent task before that task becomes "stale" (which, as Mark points out, happens in FIFO). And random selection is a lot more interesting than FIFO!<br><br>That said, the Randomizer still seems vulnerable to the basic critique that Mark raises here: <br><br><< The problem is that if people draw up a list like that, they will almost certainly have more than a day's work in it… it will take them more than a day to get through it. >><br><br>Unless the list stays short, the Randomizer will run into problems. <br><br>It seems to me that these "do everything" / "all tasks are active" systems are, in a sense, ideal. They avoid the trap of inaction that we all know well. And they hold out the goal of working on (almost) all one’s tasks daily (cf. DIT). But long-term use of such a system has (so far) eluded me.</div>
