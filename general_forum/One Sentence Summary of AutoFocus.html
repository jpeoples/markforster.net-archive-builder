<div class="content">One of the things I want to do when I re-write the Autofocus instructions is to include a one-sentence summary of how the system works. This would go at the top of the quick-start guide.<br><br>The idea is to stop some of the most common misreadings of the instructions.<br><br>Anyone like to have a go at writing such a summary?</div>

<div class="content">Not sure I could write anything in one sentence as everyone probably realises ....... :-)  Will add the task to my list tho'  (and let you know if it gets rejected!)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Beth, but what I'm actually looking for is a summary of how the system works like:<br><br>"You work on one page at a time doing the items in any order until you've done all you want to, then you move onto the next page - and keep moving from page to page until you've got to the end of the list when you start again at the first page."<br><br>Actually that's not bad! But I'm sure it can be improved on.</div>

<div class="content">Probably a bit wordy but feel free to use whatever is useful.<br><br>"Fed up with prioritising? Be guided by intuition! You run through your list, a page at a time. Certain items will 'jump' out at you which can then be done. Much more will be done as you will review your list several times a day.The key is to do a little bit of a task and re-enter it on the last page.  Little and often is the key to being productive and combatting procrastination! "</div>

<div class="content">Oooops, I just saw your clarification, Mark.  Let me try that again ;-)<br><br>"You write down a list of the items you need to do, grouped into pages of 30 - 40 items, then work on the items on one page at a time as they seem ready to be processed, moving uncompleted items to the end of the list and returning to the first page when you reach the end of the last page."<br><br>If you remove the one sentence restriction, maybe striving for a short paragraph of two or three simple sentences, it might read better.<br><br>Mike</div>

<div class="content">Flowchart:  Yeah, I needed to make one too.  It is hard to explain in words and I found that I got tangled up with moving things from one page to the end of the list ... and such like that.<br><br>Part of the problem is with the use of the word "page", I think.  At least that was what confused me.  Once I flow charted it it was clear to me how it all worked.  Also, the use of the word "page" implies that this is a paper based system (which it is for me) but it is really implementation independent.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark, how about something like .....<br><br>This radical new approach to Time Management is is simple in the extreme. Using a standard notebook of around 30-35 lines per page, list all you need or want to do, then, taking each page in order as a separate list, do whichever item or items you want to, working on it/them for as long as you want to, crossing off all completed or partially actioned tasks as you go along and relisting uncompleted tasks at the end of the last page.<br><br>Sorry Mark - 2 sentences but one is quite short :-) <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Here is a shot at using a few short simple sentences:<br><br>"Autofocus is a method of helping you focus on taking action on the most important thing you have to do.  Your attention is focused on one short page of items and you work on that page so long as you feel that there are items to do.  Once you have worked on an item, you cross it off, and move it to the bottom of the last page of your list if there is more work to be done on that item.  New items are also added to the end of the last page as they come up.  You work through your list, page by page, until you reach the end of the last page, then you start over on the first page.  Pages are completed, and excluded from further review, when all items have been crossed off or if on any pass you elect to not take action on any of the remaining items on a page."<br><br>I don't know.  It is still a bit wordy but then there are quite a few steps and conditions to be considered.</div>

<div class="content">first try<br><br>The Autofocus system utilizes your previous knowledge of creating "To-do"<br>lists, but actually allows you to work so they get "To done!"  How?  You create<br>your list, adding to it throughout the day as MORE and MORE items come to mind.<br>You scan the first page twice, once quickly, then more slowly until the combination<br>of your brain "pulls" an item out that is in conjunction with both your conscious<br>and unconscious goals.  This is the item that "POPS" into focus automatically.<br>  You work that item until tired, stopping work on it for any<br>previously scheduled appointments which are kept in a separate area.  <br>    Upon return to the list or ending the time you want to work on that item.  If the item is finished you cross it out.  If not, you cross it out and add to the end of the list.  You'll get<br>there, we promise.  <br>   Then you continue to scan that page to the bottom, and from the top to the item jsut completed looking for something to POP into focus.  Nothing that page?<br>   Then you follow the process to the next page all the way until the end of the list, and repeat.</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>Your own suggestion works for me. Here is a slightly refined version by we're really getting down to personal preference and semantics...<br>---<br>Review the first page of the list until you have done the tasks you want to do and then move onto the next page and repeat until you get to the end of the list when you start again from the beginning.<br><br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">Just to remind anyone else who feels like having a go, it's supposed to be one sentence so that it can go at the top of the Quick Start, and it's supposed to be a summary not an advertisement! <br><br>The idea is to prevent people reading the Quick Start from misunderstanding it, which quite a few people seem to have done. I will of course be amending the Quick Start to make it clearer as well.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-13 0:44</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>As much as I like the idea of clarifying things before rolling out detailed information, I wonder whether it's really possible in one comprehensive sentence.  As Mike pointed out, there are quite a few things to be considered.  Yes, it's basically very simple, but only once you are withing the framework of AF.  Without that framework, much of the AF action, both internal (towards AF) and external (from AF), tends to become very vague and prone to personal interpretation.  <br><br>AF is basically about writing a number of lists that then get reviewed and actioned according to some simple rules.  And this is where it might all get too complicated for one sentence.  Closed lists, passes through the list, re-entry - all these aspects have to be introduced and defined before they can be used for clarifying the methodology.<br><br>I am pretty sure it's not the main core aspect of AF that people misunderstand, but it's more of the nitty gritty, the real-world application of the few spelled-out and the few? not so few? implied rules.  I feel that what could be done is capture the "heart" of AF in a sentence.  But what that means in detail would have to be dealt with in detail, because the more concise and the less spelled-out I become in formulating the rules, the more people have to interpret the rules - and this is where misunderstandings arise.<br><br>I think avoiding misunderstanding will come from spelling everything out in such detail that personal interpretation is not (that) necessary anymore. Clear guidelines and rules, a quick overview of the system (as you have it in the instructions already), and a flowchart or something similar will go a long way in making clear what might have been unclear in the first run.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br><br>Joshua</div>

<div class="content">My humble contribution:<br>"... an ongoing, multi-page list where each page is treated as a separate closed list and worked repeatedly until no single task stands out, at which time you move on to the next page and repeat."<br><br><br>I've left out the way in which tasks are chosen, and how tasks are dismissed, but my grammar isn't good enough to do so without creating a monstrous run-on sentence.<br></div>

<div class="content">Do at least one task per page, working on it only as long as you want to;  when you're done, cross it off and see if anything else on the page grabs you; if it doesn't, move to the next page;  unfinished tasks (and remember, you don't have to finish a task on the first go) should be crossed off anyway, then re-entered at the end of the last page.</div>

<div class="content">A method that encourages you to develop one master task list, and then use a combination of page breaks and your own intuitive sense of what *really* needs to be done to determine the order in which tasks are accomplished.<br><br>(Much more detail than this will require a very inelegant sentence, or more than one sentence.)</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Could I also suggest in addition to summarising what AF is in the guide, that often a good way of explaining what something is, is to explain what something is _not_?<br><br>There's a few points of confusion that have come up in the beta test (which I think arise from people's experience of other systems) that could be clarified in this way? e.g. AF isn't this just a big open list because....   AF isn't like DIT because.....</div>

<div class="content">My try (the idea, my english wording might be awkward !) :<br><br>Creative use of a single todo list makes you flow actions on focus as ever before : cycle quietly down the pages, from first to last, and again from first ; assess items each in turn, jump or reject those you don't feel like, pick what stands out, do as litlle or as much of it you want, then come back where you left ; dismiss for better settling tasks you always jump, append whatever you'd eventually do as it comes to mind. Simple, fulfilling and stressfree !<br><br>Jacques</div>

<div class="content">List your tasks line by line as they occur to you.  Scan one page of tasks quickly.  Then read it slowly, and do any task that calls to you.  Repeat.  But if the first slow pass yields nothing, set aside the whole page for later evaluation.  Move to the next page.</div>

<div class="content">Here's my go...<br><br>"Treat each page as a single list. Beginning with the first active page, select one task that feels right to work on. When you are done, note a follow up task on your last list if required, and then review the page to see if another task on that page feels right. If nothing further stands out after completing your initial task, move onto the next page and repeat the process. [Optional: If nothing at all stands out the first time through a page, dismiss all items on that page and move on to the next.]<br><br>Personally, I would leave that optional sentence to be detailed in the expanded instructions, since it is open to misinterpretation.<br><br>Cheers!<br>Gordon</div>

<div class="content">In autofus you'll  be using one task list comprised of a back-end  with older unfinished tasks and a front-end with the newer tasks. The system lets you scan through all tasks in order and work on those tasks that stand out, repeating the process until you reach the end of the list, where you'll be navigate to the back-end of the list ensuring you either work on or review tasks that still have to be performed.<br><br>more cents.....;-)</div>
