<div class="content">it would be nice especially if we could get people to <br>break their concern into one of 6 areas:<br>starting, crossing off, delegation, etc., etc.<br><br>For instance, I have all my files on teh computer<br>with Prefixes:  ORG-- for organization, TEM-- for templates,<br>MAR--for marketing ideas.<br><br>Just a thought, because I'm falling behind on following threads<br>and would like to be able to come in searching for a solution or<br>area where I need help.  Sure I can post a new thread but how <br>is that managing my time and yours effectively?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Bob</div>

<div class="content">Hi Bob<br><br>The forum is searchable (see box top left of screen).<br><br>I have also started a post called FAQ's to address this problem, probably a page or back.  It is a thread for people to identify specific threads that have stood out as being particularly relevant to a common query.  My intention is to produce that as a list periodically as a reference point .......<br></div>

<div class="content">Bob:<br><br>It would be nice... but I can't see it happening!<br><br>There's a very efficient search box at the top of the left-hand margin, which sorts in order of relevance to your keywords.</div>
