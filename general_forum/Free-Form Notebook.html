<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-08-26 1:57</div>
<div class="content">By request, I am starting a new thread on this topic.  Original discussion was on : <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1577123" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1577123</a><br><br>Currently, I am using a Moleskine notebook. I was using AF4 revised the last 2 months and dividing into New, Unfinished, Recurring. I used different Moleskine notebooks for each, but found that this was unnecessarily complicated. So I have this month been keeping everything in one notebook, and creating a monthly, weekly, daily calendar as I go along when I need it, I have daily, weekly, checklists, and projects and projects notes. The pages grow organically, chronologically. Recurring became checklists. I have some trouble determining whether an item is Unfinished or New. If a new task belongs to a project, which is it? Perhaps it doesn't matter. Sometimes the task goes on a project page. I keep an index in front. I find keeping everything in one book simplifies. I can carry it around. I tried a ring binder with dividers, but gave up after a day - too clumsy. <br>I have been using computer software for 11 years to manage my time, but this summer am experimenting with paper. Looking at a computer screen with the bright light and small print is getting hard on my eyes and fatiguing. Paper is less stressful. I do have to scan the pages daily, as there is no search or tagging. <br>I tried AF1 for two months, when it came out, and come back to it off and on. I can go on that the whole day and never run out of things to do. I don't find it good for urgent deadlines or time-consuming projects. I end up not putting enough time into these when the deadline approaches. <br>I also tried Superfocus for a few months. <br>I seem to do better when I have a list of things that have to be done today or this week, and a list of projects with deadlines, in addition to the rest.</div>

<div class="content">I use a Moleskine ruled notebook, 5 by 8. There are 31 lines to each page. When I need a calendar for a day, I draw one, using each line as a half hour. When I need a calendar for a week, I draw one on two pages. When I need a calendar for a month, or a checklist for the month, I draw one, one day for each line. Each one on the next available blank page. <br>When I start planning a project, I start a new page for one on the next blank page. <br>I write new tasks on a separate page. When I need to write down what I must do today, and write the llst on a new page. <br>This means that projects are not together, and new tasks are not together, and checklists are not together, and calendars on not together, on consecutive pages. <br>I number the pages. I have a table of contents on the first page. If I want, I put the page number and description on the first page so I can find it. <br>I date each page. The pages will then be in chronological order of when I started each one. <br><br>I thought of using a 3-ring binder, and using dividers to separate each section, but I quickly gave it up after a day of trying it. Flipping pages in a Moleskine is so much faster than a binder, a binder is more cumbersome to carry around. There is still flipping of pages even with a binder with dividers. <br>Checklists save paper. However, keeping recurring lists and rewriting and crossing off a la AF1 perhaps is more likely to get the task done. <br>I hope this helps. Maybe not the perfect system, but it does have the advantage of keeping everything in one book, easy to carry around. I generally work backwards, from last page to front.</div>

<div class="content">markedhm,<br><br>I started a new posting at the same time as you! I hope Mark F. can delete it.<br><br>Following is my understanding of your approach – please clarify or correct me if this isn't what you are doing.<br><br>In a previous thread, markhedm described an interesting technique of combining the constraints of a bound notebook with the freedom of starting a new page at any time for almost any reason – ad-hoc list, calendar, day plan, etc. The idea – if I understand it correctly – is that one could interrupt a long (AF) to-do list and then continue it on following pages. The way to stay organized with such a free-form book is to keep a table of contents at the front of the book. The premises here are: (1) the "organic" nature of keeping pages in chronological order of entry – while allowing any note, drawing, etc. to interrupt the flow – is worth the required page flipping and indexing; and (2) this approach is superior to a thicker multipurpose loose-leaf notebook that would involve dividers and sorting of pages.<br><br>Thanks for starting this as a new thread.</div>

<div class="content">I came across your post on the other thread and I went out and bought a moleskin to try it out and I love it!  Thank you for such a great idea.  So far I'm about 20 pages in.  What I like most about it: <br>1.  Everything really is in one place:  calendar; task list (I use AF1, I just carry over the list to a fresh page, what's in between the pages doesn't matter to the list); daily record of events (I really loved that about Franklin Covey - I just label a page "DRE" and draw a line after each new entry and mark DRE in my table of context); project plans, calendars, etc.  I love the accessability<br>2.  This makes weekly planning a dream - everything is in there, nothing falls through the cracks at all<br>3.  I use an index rather than a table of contents at the beginning of the book.  For example, I write "AF1" and then every time I start a new page of AF1 I write the page number beside it.  If I'm done with a page, I cross the page number off.  AF1 is pretty special so I mark the pages with one of those post it tags.  <br><br>I was nervous at first about the calendar, but if I lose confidence in the monthly calendar I just take the next blank page and write out a week calendar, ditto for the day.  I drill down to as much detail as I need to function, and not more.  It's very elegant. So far, for me, this is the most all encompassing and comfortable system I have used.  We'll see how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">This seems interesting. It keeps things simple to write in order. I think in addition postit tabs - the stiff plastic writeable movable things - can add to this. Like take your monthly calendar and put a tab "month" there. Next month draw up a new page and move the tab. Similarly with every other Important page. Makes it easy to find these. <br><br>My notebook has segregated sections but I find the page order is not important. It's the tab order that matters. Down the side I have a dozen tabs in alphabetical order from top down. So whatever I want, I grab the tab and flip the page.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-08-26 4:00</div>
<div class="content">ubi, <br><br>Yes, that is what I am doing.  So the AF list is interrupted and continues on a later page.  The same thing happens with any page that is filled up, you just continue on the next blank page.  You could put the next page number on the bottom of the previous page.  <br><br>Paul <br><br>The index as you described is worth trying.  I might do that. <br><br>If you google GTD moleskine hacks, you might find some creative ideas about how to use a moleskine notebook.   Also the Tinderbox software developers have a blog about using paper notebooks. I might find it and post the link. <br>GTD hackers will divide up the notebook into GTD sections, and tab them.  However, I like the idea of continuing on without thinking about where it goes, or what to do when you run out of space. <br><br>This is my second Moleskine notebook that I used this summer.  With the first notebook, I put projects and project notes in the back, and AF list in the front.  This worked too. <br><br>I liked the idea of starting a new notebook.  The present notebook will last probably 6 to 8 weeks total. <br><br>It would be interesting to try this with a college composition notebook, which cost about $1. The Moleskines are expensive.  I like the size 5 X 8, very portable and light weight, with the hard cover.  <br>Beats a laptop or netbook in the collecting stage.  I carry it everywhere.  I can write in 10 seconds.</div>

<div class="content">Markhedm:  That's another advantage I didn't mention -- the sheer speed of it, it's really good for collecting.  I used the index idea because I was afraid of running out of space with a table of contents and some kinds of pages are very similar, like month calendar's for example.  Right now I made a month calendar for Sept, Oct. Nov and December and they are scattered throughout my pages but I have them listed under one index line:  "Monthly calendar, 2,5,6,12."  Saves three lines.  Once September is done, I'll cross out the 2. <br><br>I also like the idea of my running "daily record of events (DRE)."  I start a fresh page, if something comes up that I need to write down, I'll just date it, write it and draw a line underneath it. I may have only 4 or 5 items on the page, but once that's full, I just start a new one on the next available blank page.  Similarly, it's marked in my index as, for example, "DRE 3,7,8".  Also, I run a vertical line about a centimeter from the outside edge.  If there's some action I need to take on the note, I put it on the AF page (or a calendar page or someday list or reading list or wherever) and put a checkmark beside the item in the DRE page meaning I've processed it.  If a whole DRE page, for example page 3, has all checkmarks on it, I'll put a little x through the "3" in the index.  When I review weekly I'll be sure to concentrate on the pages that are still active or unprocessed.  And in any case, it's still there if I need to refer to it.   <br>  <br>Crossing out the number in the index works for dismissed AF1 pages and old calendar pages as well.  Keeps clutter at bay in the index.  This system gives me a real feeling of completeness and control about all my "stuff," with lots of hard edges around projects and calendars in one place.  When I just did AF alone, I felt these hard edges were missing, which is why GTD still had a kind of draw for me.  In David Allen's terminology, I have lots of stakes in the ground and they are so easy to see.</div>

<div class="content"><a href="http://www.utilware.com/gsd3.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.utilware.com/gsd3.html</a><br><br>The GSD system is a very good notebook based free-flowing system. I feel it's particulary good if one doesn't want to get into too many 'system rules' and would prefer a logical approach to getting organised and getting sh*t done. <br><br>It seems to be missing a 'waiting for' or review mechanism. But this can be easily dealt with by using a calander or sperate list. I have solved this by using a daily calendar approach.<br><br>I use a extra large moleskine. They only come in a soft cover format.  I write in the dates manually - one day to two pages (Sat and Sun 1 page each in my case). The notebook then last nearly four months, I use the left page for tasks & appoinments. I use the right page for daily notes. I have a cache of extra paper sheets in the rear pocket if needed.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>I do something like this, but I make it a bit more organized by keeping whatever AF/DWM system I am using at the front of the notebook, and everything else at the back.  The last two pages I use as a table of contents for the back portion.  The notebook is discarded once the two parts meet somewhere in the middle.<br><br>Godspeed.</div>

<div class="content">I have long been a fan of putting everything in one place, I find that looking for things is a huge waste of time.  I also at one point experimented with a system called notes based time management, which was just using a notebook and the notes taken during meetings and as you think of things etc as way to manage things to be done.  Both methods are effective.  Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I just thought of something. Right now, I'm maintaining a single AF1 pocket notebook with each double-page containing Work-related tasks listed top-left-down, and Home-related tasks bottom-right-up. If I switch to FreeForm, I could just add a new (single) WorkTasks page when needed, and a new HomeTasks page when needed. Then, when processing, I could choose to skip over an HT page when at work, without dismissing it, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi: That's sort of how I'm working it.  I don't distinguish home tasks from work tasks (yet) but I have lots of stuff that comes in after my first AF1 page - i.e. weekly and monthly calendars that I draw up, random notes, etc.  When I'm doing AF1 I just ignore all the stuff in between the AF1 pages and just add a new list to the next available blank page when I need to.  So simple.</div>

<div class="content">Scenario: Several open pages spread throughout the notebook. <br><br>Possible solution: Tear the corner tabs out from the notes pages in order to differentiate between AF pages & notes pages. (Or vice versa although tabbing out the notes pages will make it easier to identify the active AF pages).</div>

<div class="content">I like this free-form notebook idea.   <br><br>My own system is working kind of like this.  But instead of a notebook, I use a series of accordion folders.  This makes it work like a notebook with moveable pages.  <br><br>This gives some advantages in managing project material.   In a notebook with fixed pages, project material can end up being spread across several non-adjacent pages, and it can be a pain to flip back and forth, and likewise it can be a pain to consolidate the material by copying it fresh to a new page.   My solution is to have a project folder that sits on the shelf with all the other folders.<br><br>The series of folders on the shelf ends up looking something like this:<br>- AF 8/21   (a dated folder with random miscellaneous stuff to do, like a typical AF1 notebook page)<br>- AF 8/21-2  (a second folder for the date 8/21, since the first one filled up)<br>- AF 8/23<br>- Solar panels  (a project folder for our Solar Panels project)<br>- Camping (project folder for Camping)<br>- AF 8/24 <br>- Anna  (a project folder to highlight stuff my wife wants me to do)<br><br><br>The standard AF folders stay in their order on the shelf -- they always get put back on the shelf in the same order they left it.   <br><br>But the project folders get moved forward to the end of the shelf whenever I take action on them.<br><br>So, the process of cycling works like this:<br>	- Anything "stands out" in AF 8/21?  If no, then dismiss the folder (put it away in the "dismissed" box under my desk).    If yes, work on that item as long as you want; if you stop before the item is completely finished, then move that item to the last AF folder on the shelf.<br>	- When done with AF 8/21, move on to AF 8/21-2 and process the same way.<br>	- Then process AF 8/23.<br>	- Then process Solar Panels.  However, project folders get processed differently.  If I take no action on anything in this project folder, I don't dismiss it; rather, I just leave it on the shelf.   If I do take action on something in the folder, then when I'm done, I move the folder to the end of the shelf.  This keeps the project fresh and alive.<br>	- Then process Camping (using same rules as for Solar Panels).<br>	- Etc.<br>	<br>So, let's say after a few rounds, I never did anything with Camping, but I did quite a lot for Solar Panels and Anna.  Also, I dismissed 8/21 and 8/23, but the other AF folders are still "alive".   The shelf of folders could then look like this:<br>	- AF 8/21-2  <br>	- Camping<br>	- AF 8/24 <br>	- Solar panels <br>	- Anna  <br>	<br>Let's say after some more processing (and adding new AF folders to accommodate new tasks), it looks like this:<br>	- Camping<br>	- AF 8/24<br>	- AF 8/25<br>	- AF 8/26<br>	- Anna<br>	- Solar panels<br>	- Errands<br>	<br>What this means is AF 8/21-2 got dismissed or completed.  Camping has had no action.   I've added a couple new folders for misc tasks.  And I've added a new project folder for "errands".<br><br>At this point, Camping has been sitting there for a while without any action.  I can see that clearly, because there aren't any standard, dated AF folders preceding it -- they've all been dismissed or completed.   I would therefore consider dismissing the entire Camping project.   I don't enforce any hard and fast rules about dismissing projects like this -- but the longer it sits there without any action, the longer it bothers me and I need to make a decision.   Dismissal doesn't mean "EOL", it just means it gets put on the back burner for awhile.  So the project gets dismissed.<br><br>By the way, I follow almost exactly the same processing rules in Microsoft OneNote for handling work items.   I use the accordion files at home.   <br>	<br>Anyway, maybe some of these concepts can be applied to the free-form notebook idea.   The two systems appear to have a lot in common.</div>

<div class="content">Stephanie Winston in her book The Organized Executive, page 125, recommends keeping the Master List and Daily List separate, in a different notebook. She doesn't explain why.  <br>Her concept of the Master List is a single continuous list, every idea, task, project is written as it arises.  You transfer no more than 10 items to the Daily List, and cross it off the Master List. <br>As far as I understand, AF is similar to a Master List, but does not use a Daily List.<br>Question: Does one write only tasks/projects in AF?  Can one write ideas/notes too?  <br>I have been writing ideas/notes also because often they develop in tasks or projects to incubate/develop. <br>There are advantages to different approaches.  There are good reasons to keep some things in a separate notebook - one's Daily Journal of emotions and moods, one's meditations and prayers, etc. <br>The trouble with having a calendar book, and Daily List book, and an AF book,  and computer, is you have to carry them around, remember to take them, and open each one up. <br>It's difficult to find a planner or computer software that will allow you to do what you want. <br>I don't really need to carry around a planner with dates 11 months from now, although some people might.  <br>If I have a busy day coming up, I can write on the next blank page, a list of things I have to do, and cross them off from a previous page.  I don't always need to write a list, and can work AF-style.  <br>If I decide I want to keep my work items separate from my personal items, I can start on the next blank page to write only my work items.  <br>Last year, when I was visiting a small resort town on Lake Superior, I picked up at a bookstore the book "Hamlet's Blackberry", about finding balance in the digital age.  I had been checking work email, which caused me anxiety on my vacation.  Perhaps it was the wrong time to be reading the book, but there is Chapter 8 that deals with notebooks and compares them to Hamlet's tables.  The author makes the point that the computer/internet is disembodied, nonphysical. Where is the data, anyway?  Data is constantly streamng toward us, which we react to. This is draining and arduous on the conscious.  It takes mental energy to navigate.  For me as I am older, looking at the computer screen is a strain on my eyes. <br>Notebooks are tangible, physical, like we are, are easier on the mind, have blank pages, not overloaded webpages, and we determine what data gets put on them.  Notebooks are not connected, can be more private, and slows our thinking down. <br>If I need a computer I can always use one, but for me, using a notebook is a way to control how much I use the computer/internet.   Much of my daily activities don't need a computer to manage.  I don't plan on getting a smartphone or Kindle, and will try to put off geting one if I can. I have enough books I haven't read yet, and I am on the internet enough.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Rainer: <br><br>I don't personally find the master list feature in GSD that useful, so I don't bother using it. However When I did use it then yes, the master list went into the same notebook. I kept track of it very easily by tearing off the top corner out of pages after the master list but leaving the master list page corner untouched untill it became obsolete. <br><br>And at the moment I'm trialling writing 3 'completion' statements above my daily list in an effort to award certain projects priority. E.G. 'Complete 6 weeks of fitness training & review progress'. <br><br>At the end of the day I then write up my progress on each - I got this idea from Gerry's excellent 'Do It' programme. <br><br>Let me know if you have any more queries.</div>

You only have to decide which of the tasks to do next. If today is the 15th and I last swept on the 1st and cleaned the fish tank on the 3rd, I will do the fish tank so they don't get sick, even though the sweeping is older.

Sometimes I review my entire Master List when making the Focus List, but if I made one recently I don't bother.<br><br>I update the Focus List after every few tasks and the Rotating lists when it feels right (every few days).

<div class="content">thank you Cricket<br>good to hear others are creating various type of lists, as they need them. I also work with something similar to a FOCUS list. sometimes I make a QUEUE list, for what is very near term. sometimes they are in sequence of when I want to do them, other-times not, as needed. this is what is great about paper vs computer systems. paper is flexible as needed. easy enough to re-order a list, with a couple of arrows, cross out, etc. that often feels easier than true re-order built into computer system. and also helps stave off endless perfection of ordering.<br><br>here is another type of list, should go well in open ended organic fixed notebook<br><br>a now list<br><br>even after narrowing a giant brain dump master list, to just an essential set to then what needs to be done this month, to week, projects ... today ... top 10 things to do today, it is useful to have a list of only what I'm doing NOW.<br><br>not the next 5 to do, which I often get tempted to add.<br><br>only what am doing NOW. how to use:<br><br>1. write what you are about to start<br>2. do it<br>3. mark done (I fill a square solid, stands out for me more than check or line)<br>4. decide what to do next. from your day list, focus, something that interrupts, what you just feel like doing because you don't like following your plan. whatever. just write it down.<br>5. back to step 1.<br><br>the point is to just focus on one thing. and to be AWARE of what you are doing<br><br>try it, has interesting results in feeling</div>

<div class="content">Another suggestion: TNT (Three Next Tasks)<br><br>1. Write notes free form into a notebook - from the top of the notebook, working downwards. Use lower case if preferred. (I would recommend a minimum A5 size notebook). Date the notebook, only if preferred, (I use 2 pages to one day) so that it can also be used for appointments and review items. <br><br>2. Use a simple Triple Task method (write in 3 tasks maximum) - from the bottom of the notebook, working upwards. Items are entered onto the most recent page with notes. Use upper case if preferred. Selection of items can be based on what's in the notebook or what is relevant contextually to work on at the time. This allows plenty of flexibility.<br><br>3. Review the pages: Individual items can be checked off as they are done. Whole pages finished with can have a cross in the corner. Crosses can be circled if there are no previous open pages (as in AF versions).</div>

<div class="content">I also found the Inc article interesting as well as the day book.  They are both systems that use the principal of writing in one place.  Many people are worried about system to prioritize actions.  I have never thought a system could do this, since you "run" the system, so I focused on systems that cut down on wasted time.  One of the biggest wastes of time is hunting for things.  By writing in one place and using a good filing system you cut way down on wasted time and are more productive.  Additionally, by keeping it simple you don't waste time learning systems and maintaining systems.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Using a free-form notebook is like musical improvisation, you make it up as you go along.  It is in the spirit of Autofocus, in that you keep writing what comes to your mind, not just tasks, but project planning, lists, calendars, phone numbers, whatever you need to get the job done, or off your mind, a mind sweep. <br>There are GTD moleskine hacks online that divide the moleskine into sections, so that the pages are contiguous - a section for Someday/Maybe, one for Projects, one for Next Actions, one for Contexts, one for calendar, you get the idea.  This might be necessary if this were a year planner, but for a moleskine notebook with 240 pages that will be used up in a month or two or three at the most, it doesn't seem necessary.  The pages don't have to be contiguous.  One can continue to use Autofocus, one can write the next page at the bottom, and skip over any intervening pages.  If you need to find a page, flip through the book, or index the page.  <br>If more complexity is needed, or a longer time frame required, then one can gravitate to a more complex tool, like a computer.  But it is better to start with a simpler tool, or work your way up as needed.<br>For years I tried to manage time with complicated PIMs on a computer.  But 80% of what I have to do doesn't need a computer to manage.</div>

<div class="content">To me, the way that incremental formaization works: <br><br>let's say you're writing in your AF list, and you have written down errands item by item, but later consolidate them onto one list.  Or you start planning a project on your AF list, but it grows, and you decide to give the project its own page. The project keeps growing, involves more people, and more time, and you decide you need to plan it on a word processor.  Or if you knew that from the start, you could plan it from the word processor, print it out, and keep it with the moleskine in the back pocket.  <br>It is unlikely in this digital age that we will be able to avoid using a computer, and just use one paper notebook for everything.  If we have a lengthy document to email, it makes sense to draft it on word processor.  However, I am surprised that I can in a paper notebook jot down a line or two what an email was about, and to respond, without copy/paste or print it out.  Same thing with web research.  I can jot down a few lines, rather than print the document out, or save it to disk.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah, <br><br>Thanks for posting your pages.  I might try some of them.  I like the paperclips.  <br>How do you use the AF post it note? <br>Do you keep your notes and AFlist separate? <br>What is on the note pages, and what is on the AF pages? <br>What are the square boxes for? <br>WHy are some filled in black, and others blue? <br>I am assuming that it means the item is done or rewritten. <br>You don't have items crossed out like Mark Forster recommends.

<div class="content">markhedm:<br>1) The post it note is a reference for which pages have AF content... it just sits there so I have a quick overview. I haven't closed or dismissed any pages yet - when I do, I'll indicate that on the postit as well. I put it on a postit so that when all the pages listed on one are closed, I can just toss it, and so I don't have to plow through the whole table of contents looking for it. I guess you could call what's written on the red page the table of contents and the postits the index.<br>2 & 3) Notes and AF are separate by page... taking the middle photo (<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/freeform2.jpg)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/freeform2.jpg)</a> as an example... on the right-hand page is an AF page. On the left-hand page are, from top down, info about a job I'm thinking about applying for, a handful of lines of dissertation writing, some measurements that a friend needed for my daughter's halloween costume, and a breakout to do list of tasks related to a dinner party we had last Friday night.<br>4 & 5) Square boxes are just how I start a task line. When I work on a task, I color in the box. When I delete a task, I put an X in the box. When I dismiss a task, I write a "D" in the box (the highlighting of dismissed tasks never worked for me). Ink colors have no meaning... just whatever was handy at the time (I've since started carrying a black pen hooked onto the cover of the notebook, so everything's in black). Like you, I like being able to reread the list, which is harder if things are crossed out completely.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sarah, you're book looks very similar to mine (less the dissertation notes).  My table of contents is more like an index (still at the front of the book, though) and looks something like this: <br>AF 2, 12, 22, 23<br>Weekly calendar 3, 13<br>Daily notes 1, 4, 5, 8<br>etc.<br><br>This allows a shorter index list and keeps related page reminders on one line<br><br>Also, I have a page for "daily record of events" similar to yours - I draw a line under each new entry.  But I also draw a half inch margin down the side of the page, making each entry a kind of self contained rectangular box.  When I review my notes at the end of the day, I put a check mark beside it (in the margin) meaning I've processed whatever idea the record contained.  That way I know any open records have to be looked at.  I'm all about keeping things from slipping through the cracks. <br><br>I've been using this free-form method now for more than a week, and I must say it's been amazing, easy, accurate and complete.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Sarah. I noticed that you use only one page number at the top, for each pair of (facing) pages, but often the left and right sides contain very different types of content. On your next notebook, you might consider numbering each side, which should make your ToC/Index page and bottom-of-page "links" easier to manage.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah:  I do exactly the same thing -- if it's an AF item I don't waste time writing it anywhere but right into and AF list, same for calendar items.  In fact, I find I don't use that daily "record of events page" that often.  But looking at my own book I have used it for writing down phone numbers that had to go in my address book (even then, I decided to devote a page to active phone numbers!), notes about projects that needed to be indexed, ideas that come to me about my writing or speaking (which I'll use later when I'm at my computer or working on a project)  and that was about all. if I have the book with me, I have no fear of writing ANYTHING in it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sabrina, my AF list is spread through the book.  When I need to start a new AF page, I just start on the first available page.  In addition, I also list my AF page numbers in my index and since I refer to them so frequently, I use a post it tag on each AF page (I only have 4 pages at the moment).  This is still very much in the experimental stage for me.  I was concerned that the spaces between the AF pages would be somehow interfere with the AF system, but it hasn't at all, not even close.  AF pages are easy and convenient to get to.  Mind you, I'm using AF1, I don't know how it would be with AF2-4, but AF 1 is great.  Also, my feeling is that if I dedicated a few early pages to AF1, somehow I'd be worried about running out of AF pages.  That would be uncomfortable for me, but that might just be my own hangup.  I'm just really enjoying the "free-form" aspects of this method and nothing is falling through the cracks.  How are you finding this method?</div>

<div class="content">Sabrina, <br><br>With my last Moleskine notebook, I tried keeping my notes in the back, and my list in the front.  I was constantly flipping from the front to the back.  I found it more convenient to write the notes in the front in order.  This mixes up the pages, but has the advantage that the pages are closer together, and in order of entry.  So the most recent pages will be close together. <br>One could arrange a notebook anyway one wants.  <br>A Moleskine does not have perforated pages to tear out to rearrange.  Some assign different sections of the Moleskine to different categories, but how does one know how long a section will be?  There is likely to be an oveflow of at least one category.  Also, this means flpping from one section to another.</div>

<div class="content">So far it's not a problem for me... I currently have 7 open AF1 pages and about the same number of notes pages. Anytime any content (personal journal entry, work notes, AF list) continues on a following page I indicate that at the bottom of the page (ubi called them "links" above and I admit, that's how I think of them, too) so I don't have a problem knowing where I'm going next. Where Paul is using post-its, I'm using paperclips... I don't have one on every AF page but I do have them for the first, last, and current pages.</div>

<div class="content">You could equally go with alternating pages.  List on left, notes on right.  These don't even need to be synced to progress at the same page.  If your notes run ahead too far, you can easily adapt by using both sides.  Or, go with Gerry's system: Notes and lists on every page, but list-items are marked to stand out.</div>

<div class="content">One challenge I'm having is keeping track of all my "links" to my next pages. I started out trying to update them every time I dismissed a previous page but that was a lot of scribbling out and there was the potential to miss pages if I didn't do it correctly (my poor page 38 got orphaned for a couple of days as a result of such an error). So now if I have C/D pages in between open ones I'm not bothering and just flipping quickly past those inactive pages. I indicate their C/D status at the top of the page so it's not hard to tell.<br><br>(And now i don't have to dismiss page 56 because I did one item on it.)</div>
