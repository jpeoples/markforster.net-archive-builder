<div class="content">I still maintain a Projects list, Agendas list, Waiting For list and Someday/Maybe list from GTD.  I manage my other Next Actions using AF.  I have not yet adjusted to mixing these particular items in the long AF list.  I think they get lost in the list, or else represent non-actionable things that I don't want to keep seeing over and over again as I go through the lists.<br><br>I keep all these in Outlook tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I have a Tickler file for date-activated tasks.  I have projects and project books, but not a projects list.  To work on projects I mention them or particular tasks in my AF list.  I use a Someday list, though not much.  These plus reference materials are _all_ my management elements.</div>
