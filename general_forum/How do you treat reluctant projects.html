<div class="content">I spoke in my thread <a href="../general_forum/How I finally made it ! At last !!!.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2660988</a><br><br>"There are some crucial engagement which are repeated again and again. I feel very reluctant to do them. I decided to plan the most important one and try to do my best to do it at this time. But sometime I am simply un able. The perfect example is my list of building. I know I have to do it. But I dont feel it. I just cant. It is like this since 2 weeks. I am just un able to do it until one day I will do it on one batch (which in this example will be half a day)"<br><br>I wonder if you have the same trouble. Are there some projects you just can't do. What strategies do you use ? How do you get rid of them ?</div>

<div class="content">I had some additional thoughts, which were long and started going off in a different direction.<br><br>So I posted them here:<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2665241#post2665245" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2665241#post2665245</a></div>
