<div class="content">I work with AF since a week and it works quite well wih me<br>I found a few tips that i wish to share with you, may be you found others and it could be a nice list.<br><br>1. i put all my items one by one with always a project name (usually one or two words)<br>2. i highline in orange all my project <br>3. When i wait for something or a message i use this shortcut ③ and color it in GREEN, dito if it's a message to call me back with M$<br>4. All due date is mentionned  at the end of the item and the date is colored it in pink<br>5. All my items wich have to be done today has a * (star) in front of them<br>6. My notebook is diveded in two verso has my professional tasks, recto has my personnal tasks<br>7. i write my notes like an item one after the others and treat them dido<br>8. i put every thinking on my notebook watever they may be<br>9. i always add all my substacks when i write the task and go as far as i can<br>10. I use little and shortly mind map in front of the items when things become complicated or if i hesitate or think about solutions. <br><br>The result is <br>i have a better focus on what i do<br>i work faster<br>i easely can find my items</div>
