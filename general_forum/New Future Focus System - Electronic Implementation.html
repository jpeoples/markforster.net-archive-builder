<div class="content">Ok - I'll bite.  At first I read it and thought - ick!  Then I decided I'd try it.  I don't have any planners on hand since I use gcal on my iPhone, so I decided I'd test with an electronic tool for a few days.<br><br>I picked Toodledo since I already had an account and the iPhone app.  I suppose any decent task manager with dates would work.  I took my current paper list of 47 remaining tasks and entered them into toodledo and post-dated them by 30 days from the date I had listed in my paper version (which worked perfect since my oldest task was only 3 weeks old).<br><br>Here's what I like so far...<br><br>1.  I get an instant closed list for the current day - stuff that HAS to be done today so I know exactly where to start.  :)<br><br>2.  I get a sort of prioritized list...items currently in progress are at the top of my list when sorted by due date.  <br><br>3.  Finally a way to implement tasks that repeat on a specific day...and with toodledo I add a "start date" so these tasks are hidden until they day they are due which keeps the list uncluttered.  This feature saves me the worry of wondering if I re-entered the item or not.  :D<br><br>And the bonus of adding this to my phone is kind of a big deal for me.  I'm on the go so much right now that having a portable list is really helpful.  I like being able to quickly add stuff, pre-date it and move on.  I'm getting a lot done and feeling like I get the important things done for the day.  I do like the idea of feeling like you're clearing future lists.  That feels good.  Feels less like I am behind on life and more like I'm in control.<br><br>Just my two cents.</div>
