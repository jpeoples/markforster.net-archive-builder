<div class="content">Used it for quite a long time for voice-to-task transcribing while driving until I discovered Vlingo ( <a href="http://www.vlingo.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.vlingo.com/</a> )<br><br>Looked at it for a long time ago for AF compatibility but couldn't really see a slick way of making it work</div>

<div class="content">I've noticed that the location services don't work on my old iPhone 3G. I might get some friends to try it out on their 3GS and 4G.</div>

<div class="content">I used to use it a lot for capturing, but not so much for processing since it takes quite a bit of time to maintain it. But, if you are simply looking for a capture tool that is incredibly convenient, than you will be very happy with it! :)<br><br>Jonathan<br><br><a href="http://www.photosforsouls.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.photosforsouls.com</a></div>
