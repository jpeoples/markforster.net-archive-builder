<div class="content">I've struggled to use GTD for the past 5 years but, after about 3 months of AF, have really found it to have so much more 'balance'.   Big thanks Mark for this v ingenious system.<br><br>I'd started using AF with a standard Moleskine notebook and Space Pen - very GTD - but over the past few weeks have switched to Evernote. Anything can be thrown at Evernote from pretty much anywhere -  photos of handwritten notes, voicenotes, webclippings etc can be sent from other computers, Iphones etc.  I can also access them from any computer (or my Iphone). <br><br>It's therefore pretty much the perfect capture tool.  I enjoy the paper approach but there are times when typing on a computer is just that much easier.  However, by using Evernote, I don't feel that I'm sacrificing the paper approach as I can always take a quick snapshot of my doodles/mindmaps etc with my phone and send them straight to Evernote (into whatever the latest notebook/page is).  They even have a very effective way of allowing words to be searched for in handwritten scanned notes. <br><br>I've used Onenote extensively in the past and think it's a pretty slick tool - I'm just finding that the total accessibility and flexibility of Evernote lends itself more easily to AF.  I'd be interested in anyone else's experience with Evernote. Apologies if this area has been covered elsewhere in the forum. This is my first contribution to this forum although I've really enjoyed reading everyone's experiences with AF so thanks to all for sharing.</div>

<div class="content">Andy C,<br><br>I like EN a lot. I was using Google Notebook, when they announced they were dropping it. So I migrated to EN. The sync works almost flawlessly. I use it on my desktops and home and work, as well as on my smartphone (Blackberry).<br><br>I imagine you could use the client version and display the note list. <br><br>You could define the visible note list as a "page". You could use tags for "completed" and "dismissed." But this seems very kludgy. After a few weeks or months, why would I want to scroll down through 1,000 notes to find the next active one?<br><br>How do you recommend using EN?</div>

<div class="content">I use Moleskine for my AF lists and EN for everything else. There's something immensely satisfying about crossing an item out with a pen.<br><br>I also don't like to mix up my supporting notes/etc with my List - I have a recurring task that is 'Review EN inbox'.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Moises<br><br>I create a new notebook called PG X (eg 1,2 ,3 etc) for each page.  When I get to 40 items on a page, I'll just start another notebook. <br><br>When I've completed an item, I'll simply relabel it with a --- at the front.  When I've "retired" a page, I simply move all the items to an Archive notebook and delete that page/notebook so as to avoid having too many open notebooks over time.  I have 5 actve notebooks/pages at the moment.<br><br>I also tend to tag each note with a label notifying the project name or some other quick ID (ie Admin, blogs etc) just so I can get a quick sense of what's on each page before I do my 'quick sweep' of the actual notes. <br><br>Totally understand why people like paper but I'm just finding that Evernote is currently a really great solution to satisfying both sides of my personality.   If, for instance, I feel I'm losing focus,  I'll just draw a quick 20,000ft mindmap on a piece of paper with my priorities on, take a picture of it and then send it to Evernote. If I read an article on line that I want to follow up on, I can just capture it into Evernote immediately.  If I've taken written notes during a meeting, snap them and send to evernote.<br><br>I'm finding that having the ability to initially throw absolutely anything at Evernote (which  subsequently gets done or refined into actual tasks) really seems to gel with the spirit of AF.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a recovering GTDer (sober for almost 2 weeks now).  I love AF and am getting so much  more done.  I'm currently using the Moleskine.  I'm really enjoying the pen and paper approach.  The physicality of crossing something out and and rewriting at the end of the list seems like part of what generates the momentum of AF.  Maybe the same effect can be generated electronically, but I  haven't experimented.<br><br>I do have two pieces of my system that are electronic. Many actions amount to "Respond to email from X" or "Check out website ...".  I just have an Actions folder I move pending emails to and then on paper I write the action and put an 'e' at the end indicating an email is attached to the action.  For other items like a website I want to review I write the action and put a circled 'v' at the end.  This means I've placed the reference material in Evernote.  I keep one note in Evernote where I dump all those extra electronic items I want to review.  Since they are also available on my iPhone it's very handy.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I keep trying to squeeze AF into an electronic form. Most of the programs I've looked at (including Evernote) are great for collection of tasks, but not so good (for me) for the actually DOing stage.<br><br>I'm experimenting now (in TaskPaper) with collecting on the computer, then printing out to paper, and using that as my AF task list.<br><br>It works ok, but the downside, of course, is syncing crossed out tasks, and new hand-written tasks with the computer.<br><br>The upside is that my list is easy to read, tidy, and, for the few things that I like to break out by category, I can do so on the computer.</div>

<div class="content">I haven't tried Evernote for AF, but I've tried a LOT of programs. I don't like the inability to cross off tasks with Evernote. I need something that works on the IPhone since it's always with me. I find as much satisfaction from having items crossed off digitally as from paper. The programs I have used with AF are:<br>www.tadalist.com<br>www.toodledo.com<br>Appigo's ToDo<br>Pocket Informant for IPhone<br>AutoFocus.cc<br>Things<br>Remember the Milk<br>LifeBalance<br><br>Right now I am using Pocket Informant the most, but Appigo's ToDo is the most satisfying in terms of crossing off completed items. I just love the integration of the calendar with my AF list in Pocket Informant. I still don't have an app that allows me to scroll through my pages. Still waiting for a true AF app for the IPhone, but so far I'm satisfied.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>I've also tried the RTM, Toodledo and ToDo on the Iphone and do actually like them better than Evernote's Iphone App which pretty much relies on an internet connection to retrieve data.  Having said that, using AF on the Iphone is not particularly satisfying anyway - I prefer a computer screen - being able to send all types of files into Evernote has more value for me.<br><br>I agree with you on crossing off items in Evernote - would certainly be nice.  What I've done as a workaround is that when I finish an item, I put it into one Master "Done" folder.  In this way, I can see at a glance  the number of 'active' items in each folder. I'm finding that trying to get each folder to zero is a good motivation. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">re Crossing off items in Evernote -<br><br>In addition to the checkbox (ctrl-shift-C), highlighting the item and doing a strikeout (ctrl-T) could be more visually appealing. You can also create searches based on the status of checked/unchecked items (todo:true|false|*).<br><br>I'm still a paper/pen girl but I left my notebook at home this morning which made me almost regret not using something web-based :)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Sabrina<br><br>I don't think you can get their headings/titles crossed off in the same way that you can with the actual text in the notes.  You'd think you'd be able to so may be I'm missing something.  Haven't really experimented with their ToDo boxes yet - just like the simplicity of one note = one item/task.<br></div>

<div class="content">I'm giving Listomni for IPhone a test run now and so far I REALLY like it. It's the ONLY IPhone task manager that allows me to not only see the number of tasks remaining per lpage, but allows me to scroll down through pages that I have open without having to go back to the main list and select the next page. The other feature I love (there are many) is not having to retype anything. You can copy and paste items and as you type, previous entries pop up for selection. You can also easily move tasks with your finger from one page to another. The only drawbacks so far that will be rectified by this summer is that there is no website sync (you back up via email) and no task repeat (though copying and pasting serves this function now and it's coming soon). <br><br>Listomni is a VERY flexible program that can be used for groceries and any other lists you might have a need for. I do love the integration of calendar and tasks available on Pocket Informant, but the program runs very, very slowly at this point.</div>

<div class="content">Since the conversation has become general, I wonder if anyone's had a look yet at Daylite for iPhone yet.<br><br>I use the desktop version (Mac only) for contact-related information, but it has full calendar and task features, all of which apparently is now working on iPhone.<br><br>It may very well be overkill for AutoFocus, but I'd love to hear from anyone who's tried it!</div>

<div class="content">Evernote is awesome! No other program that I've come across does the "capture anything and everything" gig like Evernote. I don't use it for my Autofocus lists, however. It isn't designed to do this. When I was using a Circa Notebook, I used Evernote to store web pages, emails, and scans related to my tasks. I kept project lists, shopping lists, and other sublists in there as well. I was using Evernote so much, I even started using a handwritten tag (kind of like a backwards lowercase "e" that is supposed to look like an elephant).<br><br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7925615@N07/3421880436/in/set-72157616471904224/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/7925615@N07/3421880436/in/set-72157616471904224/</a><br><br>If you're on the mac, I recommend either Taskpaper or The Hit List (I'm currently using THL) for managing your AF lists.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Palletguru,<br><br>I'm finding Evernote & AF is really working well for me.  Maybe I haven't been particularly clear in describing how I'm using Evernote for AF.  <br><br>All I see for each folder/page are 40 headings which might be specific tasks (with no note attached) or might be very general headings like, for example, "Money Brainstorm" which, if I clicked on it would show me an imported hand drawn sketch of a very rough project type plan. I can then decide do do something further on the plan or simply refine it further by adding associated tasks to my latest folder.  <br><br>Evernote is not my main note storage system - I use the Brain and Onenote for more structured 'processed' notes.  However, it is simply a great tool for capturing unfiltered information/ideas/tasks - anything I think I may need to action further - one note at a time.</div>

<div class="content">Andy C,<br><br>Sounds just great what you are doing with Evernote - using it in a way that I haven't thought of until reading your clarification. Your application of AF within Evernote is a testimony to the flexibility of the system. I would like to see some screenshots of your notebook layout.<br><br>The Evernote team has been very diligent in updating the iphone app - hopefully task completion is on the short list for upgrades.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this thread. I enjoy hearing about others' digital productivity solutions. I checked out Daylite and it appears to be intended for business customers from the features and steep price tag. I am sure I am not using Evernote as effectively as I could be.</div>
