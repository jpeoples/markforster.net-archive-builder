<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-4 16:18</div>
<div class="content">I'm a doctoral student in the fifth year of my program.  I'm slated to go on the job market in August, which means that paperwork must be turned to potential employers by June.<br><br>Around February, an event happened that sent me into a depression that lasted months. I've since been treated for that and have been feeling good for months.<br><br>However, my momentum never returned.  I have two papers that I need to finish: The first should have been completed in August, and I kept telling my advisor: "One more week, just one more week."  The irony is that it's almost finished.  But now that it's so late, I'm scared to even start it.<br><br>What makes it even scarier is that I have yet *another* paper ahead that I must finish this spring.  That paper should have been near completion by now, and here I am barely having begun it.<br><br>Long story short, I work best when I believe I'm ahead of the game.  When I think I'm behind, I get frightened and just fall further behind.  By this point, I'm so scared that I haven't been to the office in 2 months (grad students can work at home) and have been avoiding work email because I'm afraid to hear from my adviser.  I know that he wants a draft of this paper delivered before he has anything more to say to me.<br><br>So I get up in the morning and want to work.  But I'm so frightened  that it's scary to even open up the document.  I immediately start thinking of all the obstacles I don't even know about that still lie ahead, and I'm paralyzed.  So afternoon comes, and I end up just playing games online or going shopping for supplies for my hobby. (I've read the Now Habit but somehow this fear keeps overtaking me.)<br><br>Has anyone here ever been in this deep, or in an otherwise similar situation.  And Mark, have you ever had a client in this situation?  If so, what helped?  <br><br>Thank you so much,<br>Rachel</div>

<div class="content">Oh, as far as DIT goes: It worked well the first time I tried it.  But one issue is that I have a hard time estimating how long tasks will take, so it's hard to know what a day's work would be.  And also, the sheer fear I've described above makes it hard to resist those quasi-urgent "tasks" that come up.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I've coached loads of doctoral students with this sort of problem. It's very common!<br><br>The secret is to set yourself the goal of doing some work on it every day. "Some work" can mean as little as getting out a book or opening a file. If you make sure you do something however small every day without fail, your momentum will soon return.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Rachel<br><br>It's never too late! It seems you do want to find an answer otherwise you wouldn't be asking the question and this is a BIG sign of hope - really it is.<br><br>Do what Mark says - I've found it really helps get you out of a rut, however deep. Think to yourself - today I'll just... "get the folder out", "read for 5 minutes" - use a timer for this they're great, "do 5 minutes research" and then believe that is ALL you have to do that day if that's what you want. Or you might find that when you've done 5 minutes you might want to do another 5 minutes (but maybe not, it doesn't matter).<br><br>Things are always scariest when you think of all there is still to do. If you just do a little bit EVERY day then the fear does subside. And also - very important - if you stop again and miss a day or several days, DON'T GIVE UP! KEEP GOING/START AGAIN and before you know it the momentum WILL return.<br><br>Good luck - I'm SURE you can do it - remember you've made the first move by asking the right question. You have a desire to keep going so build on that.<br><br>Here's thinking of you and wishing you all the best.<br><br>Hannah</div>

<div class="content">Hi Rachel, I've had experience of academic projects and I know they can easily become a big dark cloud that looms overhead. I've also tried the Now Habit but couldn't get on with it as I did not find it very flexible for real life. <br><br>The best advice I could offer would be to 1: Use a timer and 2: write down (in your Task Diary) 'spend 15 mins (or other amount) on x project/work and then stop'. 3: Stop as soon as the timer goes. 4: Gradually re-build your tolerence/stamina over several weeks by increasing the session time and amount of sessions per day. <br><br>I guess you could ask 'what is the point in only doing 15 minutes? But 15 minutes is better than 0 minutes and the anxiety of having the project not move at all. Best of luck.</div>

<div class="content">Rachel<br><br>You seem to be forgetting how much you have achieved already.  Very few people even become doctoral students!<br><br>Do It Tomorrow is a fantastic tool but maybe you need a bit more help with your negative thinking.  Our subconscious minds are very powerful and sometimes need a push in the right direction.  Consider seeing a hypnotherapist or using hypnotherapy audio cds such as Glenn Harrold's.  I fell into a rut a few years ago and found both to be really helpful.<br><br>Good luck and let us know how you get on.</div>

<div class="content">Rachel<br><br>I think the replies above give a lot of useful advice.<br>My additional suggestions would be:<br><br>1. Stop beating yourself up so much and remember to ENJOY what you are doing. You might not get this chance again so try to relax a bit and make the most of it.<br><br>2. Get a friend to mentor you. They do not need to understand the academic content of what you are doing but you could get them to help you to identify a list of tasks that still need to be done. Then pick one task at a time and arrange a time to contact them each day/week and just talk about where you've got to. If it's not done, you have to explain to them why not. Having an outsider's interest (who is not as threatening as your advisor) might help you to get over the procrastination.<br><br>3. Use the online games/shopping as rewards for when you've completed a task rather than as a distraction!<br><br>4. Take a break from the original paper. Work on the paper that is due in spring first and go back to the other one later.<br><br>You CAN do this and if you really want to then you will.<br>Let us know how you get on!<br></div>

<div class="content">Great advice from so many.  One more idea, though.  My husband recently completed medical boards with great success after several failures.  The difference?  He lowered his anxiety/depression meds (with doctor's supervision) because they made him rather lethargic...among other side effects.  We haven't noticed the anxiety or depression worsening and he's been on a lower dose since late last winter.  <br><br>The medication changed his life (and mine as a result) dramatically and wonderfully.  Lowering the dose a bit helped him achieve a goal he set twenty years ago.  Best wishes!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Rachel<br><br>I've been going through a similar block when I literally would do nothing rather than face the fear of things that I really knew were important (and which deep down I did want to do or get on top of).  Having started Mark's Autofocus system this morning I cannot quite believe how something so simple can work the way Mark says it does.  However, my experience (albeit only of a few hours) is that it really does work.  I would suggest splitting your papers down to smaller tasks, e.g. "get all files together for xxxx" or "write initial Outline for paper xxxxxx"  and include on the list with other items such as "buy x for [my hobby]", "clean oven", "check email" or "unload the dishwasher".  I cannot believe not just the amount I have got through today, but the fact that I am really not procrastinating, have progressed one of my major "hang-up" projects (and have even cleaned the oven!)<br><br>Hope that helps......</div>

<div class="content">I can't help empathise with Rachel. I have done my list and there are so many things that I should have done ages ago that I get really anxious looking at it. I have had to hide it for the moment. The advice on writing a book (another thread I can't find now) 'do what's best for you' provokes anxiety too. I've no idea what is best for me. I am pretty rubbish at every method I've tried.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Rachel,<br><br>Your situation is not at all unusual and struck a chord with me. As a university undergraduate I remember feeling so far behind I was as that I was barely able to leave my room and face the world and face friends and acquaintances let alone lecturers. The more I avoided thinking about it the more frightening the backlog looked.<br><br>The really good news is that starting to list individual steps in some detail (as Christine suggests)  is immediately and intensely therapeutic. However long the 'real list' is it's less scary than the fear of the nebulous imaginary 'non-list' we tend to carry around in our heads all day long nagging at us.<br><br>One of the nice things about this new Autofocus system is that you can you add a really large amount of tasks (including open ended tasks) and benefit from the relief of geting them 'out of your head' (in the terminology of 'Geting Things Done') without the feeling of instant overwhelm you get from promising to yourself that you're going to do them all 'today' or in some other short timescale.<br><br>Autofocus also allows the unconscious mind time to review the tasks 'in the background' so that they seem clearer and more manageable when you come to review them in a subsequent pass through the list.<br><br>As I write I'm gathering up the myriad loose ends of a chaotic pre-Christmas scramble into an Autofocus list and immediately feeling much more calm and in control of the busy year ahead. By the way, I successfully passed the exams I was so panicked about as an undergraduate once I'd started methodically tackling the backlog piece by piece.<br><br>All the best,<br>Mike<br></div>

<div class="content">Rachel, I think I know what you are feeling, having struggled with a certain project to almost insanity last year! One technique which worked for me was to set a timer for 7 SECONDS and do just 7 seconds... whatever tiny little piece I could think of that would be easiest (like, even FINDING the file on my hard drive, let alone opening it.)  It is amazing how long even a few seconds can be on a project which seems to be completely overwhelming. Another thing I tried to do was to know what I was doing after those 7 seconds .. ie knowing I had to leave for an appointment or go shopping/ to dinner etc. This was my "brute force" method.<br><br>Let us know how you are getting on .... I also used some other techniques which I could post about .. and am happy to report that I did finally complete my project (albeit much later than I had hoped, but it is off my desk, now!!)<br><br>BTW, so far I am loving the Autofocus method and believe I have accomplished far more this morning than I would have otherwise expected! (have not completed any of my "priorities" for the day, but got some other good things done!)</div>

<div class="content">I too have a paper waiting to complete. Even though it would complete a 4 year study, I struggle working on it, because it feels like 'jumping through hoops' and I resist efforting that has little real use. <br><br>The one tip I would offer I derived from Dryden's book on procrastination. Starting a task may cause you discomfort (even the very idea of starting the task, or the idea of discomfort), so this leads to procrastination. In this way, we almost think we'll get to the task until it feels there will be no discomfort. Implicitly you've created a rule that a certain condition must be true in order for you to work on a task. This rule can be the absence of discomfort, or fear, or some other condition. <br><br>Thing is, if you change the rule, you find you can work on the task. All you need to adopt is a new belief/rule. Even if you are fearful or overwhelmed, you still are physically able to work on the task. Even though you are late, you are still able to work on the task. All you need to do is to subtly change your 'working conditions'. <br><br>People don't give themselves credit for their ability to work on something in the presence of discomfort/fear/pain. And with projects like these, the discomfort is mostly associated or present while starting the task. Once you get into it, in most cases, the discomfort disappears. <br><br>This was a big a-ha for me....<br><br>one switch in your thinking and you do a ji-jutsu on self-created resistance. Moving around resistance is btw one of the best elements of Mark Forster's techniques.. <br><br>@Bev<br>Excellent posting! Would love to hear the other techniques you used Bev? <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Rachel<br><br>How's it going?<br><br>I noticed we hadn't heard from you since you first posted this and wondered how you were. It would be good to hear from you.<br><br>Good luck - thinking of you<br><br>Hannah</div>

<div class="content">Other techniques I've used:<br><br>1. This one usually works well and is fairly easy: Decide on a SMALL part of the project that I could do, and then get together all the supporting materials I would need to do it (books, files, laptop, whatever) and then take them to a favorite coffee shop or restaurant and do the work, there, while enjoying a nice drink or meal.  :o) NOTE: this could ALSO be a 7-second task if the project is extremely difficult. (Usually the first 7 seconds "breaks the logjam" for me though.) <br><br>2. Another technique which I can count on is Cybernetic Transposition, but it takes more work than #1. In the full book, the technique I use when I am really stuck is the Super Achievement Clearing Process. In the free e-course, best one to use would be Lesson #9:  An easy way to Resolve your Unconscious Conflicts .. To get the free course  (I hope it's OK to post this link):  (don't let the name put you off ... Stuart Lichtman's book rates among my top 10 most important "finds" in life): <br><a href="http://www.anything-fast.com/?fid=brochureguru" rel="nofollow">http://www.anything-fast.com/?fid=brochureguru</a><br><br>3. This free mp3 on Focusing and working with "action blocks" has also been helpful to me: <a href="http://www.focusingresources.com/downloads/focusing_and_blocks.mp3" rel="nofollow">http://www.focusingresources.com/downloads/focusing_and_blocks.mp3</a><br><br>4. Still another technique I've used is Neil Fiore's getting into the "Flow State" recording. I like the version on my very old tape version of Quality Work, Guilt Free Play, but I think some version is also in his "The Now Habit." or his "Conquering Procrastination.") This only seems to work if the task isn't TOO aversive, for me!<br><br>5. Another technique which I've just found (and which I successfully used on a very difficult task the other day ...) is "Afformations"  ... basically I just asked myself a question repeatedly, like, "Why will this task be easy for me?" or "Why will I be successful at completing this?" and then giving my brain a chance to come up with the answers! :o)  <br><br>6. Yet another technique for literal "piles" of stuff that I have had difficulty dealing with is one I found on this site ... I think it was called "The Power of 3 * 3" and it has been very helpful ... kind of like Autofocus for physical piles of paper.  :o)  hey! maybe it would also be helpful in my getting my kitchen organized too !! (ie maybe it would be a helpful technique for Things, not just papers.) <br><br>Hope something in here is helpful for someone!<br><br>Rachel .. how's it going?<br><br>Bev<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Oh, I forgot I wanted to say also AUTOFOCUS !! This is working amazingly well for me, so far. With other techniques/ systems I've tried, there's been a LOT of work (reading or listening) to get anywhere, but with Autofocus, after I read the Quickstart instructions, I was basically up and running and getting stuff done. I have been combining it with the "one minute rule" (which I also learned about from Mark's site) and so far, so great! I will continue to customize it I think, and not sure how it well it will work for tasks I would really rather avoid, but I do think that seeing them on the list at each pass-through, does help to "desensitize" the aversion and helps my unconscious maybe start working on the project, in the background. Another thing I really like about Autofocus is that it has been easy to "recover" from a day or two off when I had to be out and to get back on track, doing things. THANKS MARK !!</div>
