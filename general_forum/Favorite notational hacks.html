<div class="content">For those of us that use a paper notebook, I thought it might be interesting to start a new thread about little tricks (hacks) for keeping one's place.  I do use most of Mark's suggestions, under the "Signs and symbols" section near the end of the main posting at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html</a> – as well as several other markings that he and others have posted.<br><br>I'm currently using a "FreeForm" pocket notebook, with AF1 pages interspersed with other ad-hoc lists, daily journal pages, etc. I keep a table of contents (index) on the first page, to help me find the next AF page, as well as from/to "links" on the bottom corners of each AF page.  One of the hacks I use is the left-margin dot to mark the next task to be done. I don't like to leave the notebook without making a dot on the next thing I plan to do. But if I'm taking a break, I will use a pencil to make the dot, as it's possible that priority will shift when I get back to working the system. I use a Pilot Dr. Grip 4+1 multipen – the "+1" means that it includes a mechanical pencil – so I always have pen color choices and pencil handy.<br><br>Today I realized that I want to get a lot of little things done, spread out over several AF pages in the book. So I scanned all of the AF pages this morning, and penciled a small circle in the dot's place on each of the tasks I hope to complete today.  I think this will work very well, and save me some time doing the normal first scan at each page visit.<br><br>Please share your favorite notational tips and tricks below!</div>

<div class="content">The biggest and most helpful notation I use actually came from "2mc" and is regards to follow-up on delegated tasks. If I delegate a task, I start the task with the number of times I've followed-up and the date I last contacted the person. So if I ask Patsy to pick up my dry-cleaning, I write:<br>(0-8/30) Patsy to get dry-cleaning<br>And a follow-up would turn into:<br>(1-9/2) Patsy to get dry-cleaning<br><br><br>... Now I just need to find a patsy to get my dry-cleaning. :)</div>

<div class="content">My done pages get a giant diagonal line. <br>Task -> project, to tie a task to a project. <br>P project to tell me to look up said project for details.</div>

<div class="content">Number the pages. <br>One could only number the odd pages, or the even pages.  One could later number the unnumbered pages. <br>Leave some pages blank in front. <br>Use an index or table of contents in the front.  Use the page numbers for reference. <br><br>notesaboutnotes.com  has more hacks.</div>

<div class="content">Question: <br><br>Is it better to use a checklist for recurring tasks, writing the item only once, and using a checkmark for each time it is done, thus saving paper,<br>or putting a line through the item, and rewriting it, as in AF?  This uses up more paper, but I find I am more likely to do the item.</div>

The disadvantage of that is they can clog up the system.<br><br>Second is the checklist: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1253799" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1253799</a><br><br>Another is "filtering/pre-filtering": <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814#item1265787" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814#item1265787</a><br><br>The last, and what I am currently working upon, is tagging.  Still working on it, so no link to show, sorry.  <br><br>Personally, I found checklists to be most effective in reducing clutter in AF1.  Filtering/pre-filtering is good for AF4.  Tagging is for time-based dismissal systems like DWM2, but, as I have said, still working on that.<br><br>Godspeed.</div>

<div class="content">A compromise system: The line says do something five times (or a week's worth). When you've done it five times, it gets a new line.</div>

<div class="content">I identified four aspects of living as essential, and am using the initial letter to highlight which is key for each task. The idea is to continually be aware of whether life has a healthy balance to it. My key areas are<br>(C)ommunuity: sharing time with friends, family, etc. <br>(S)ervice: work, volunteering, doing stuff for people<br>(L)iving: enjoying life, Fun<br>(F)itness: mental, physical, emotional, financial health; fit to serve, commune, and live well. <br><br>The idea for this originally came from the program Life Balance.</div>
