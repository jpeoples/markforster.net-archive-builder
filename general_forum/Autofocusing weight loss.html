<div class="content">Christine gave the following advice on another thread:<br><br>"A simple AF tip for dieting - add a task to "lose 1lb". You can either add it periodically e.g once every two or three pages, or every page is you wish, or just readd each time completed. Each time you lose a 1lb you can cross it off. If it becomes the last item on the page and it is not achieved you can just dismiss it - and readd it if and when appropriate. No detail needed, no pressure. And you can just do it from your last weight, eg if you happen to put on a few pounds just treat each "lose 1 lb" as from your last weigh in. "<br><br>Just wondering if anyone's tried this or had it work for them.  It seems to me that this is a goal, not a task/action.  You can't "do" lose one pound.  You CAN do the things that (may or may not) lead up to losing that pound.  But dieting seems to me to be more about what you DON'T do rather than what you do.  That's the concept that Mark followed on his tweak of the no-S diet, it was a system of take-aways (skip seconds, desserts, meals) rather than adds (exercise, eat salad).   <br><br>AF does work for exercise/fitness goals for me though as that's something I can actively do.  And it works for putting such items as "make low fat muffins" - it just can't stop me from reaching for a cookie instead of the muffin, unfortunately.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">On the AF list: "Eat a cookie instead of a muffin."   ;o)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>Yes, I agree, it is not a good idea to put that kind of goal on the list.  Better to put reminders to join health club, work out, plan better meals, etc.<br><br>But beyond that, in my own personal experience, this kind of thing needs to be a life style rather than a one off kind of event.  IOW, what you probably want is to exercise 3 times a week EVERY week, to eat better meals EVERY day, etc.  So this implies a habit change and ought to be approached that way, IMO.  In my own case, I have this kind of thing scheduled for block times so they get done every day.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>The "lose a 1lb" option is something I have tried and is working quite well for me.  I take what you say about the wording and had exactly the same thought about it but it just seemed to be the right wording in my case.  It may be a goal as opposed to a task but for me it is only akin to putting a whole project on the list as opposed to the tasks leading to it (exercise, diet etc) although it is in itself a part of a larger whole (to lose more than 1lb).<br><br>The reason it works for me is that it is non-threatening. It is small enough that it is achievable and also small enough that if I have to dismiss an occurrence of it I am not going to feel a failure.  For me it needed to be non-specific rather than relating it to gym classes etc.  A knee problem has put paid to my current gym and exercise class attendance and consequently has been the inspiration for some of my weight gain :-)   For me losing weight is not just about losing weight, but is more related to overall health and fitness.  At present I do want to lose weight but do not want to "go on a diet" and cannot exercise.  My aim is to improve my overall health and having just a generic "lose 1lb" on my list prompts my sub-conscious to keep an eye on my diet, to buy healthier options, to get my knee problem identified etc etc.  I do find other health related issues more clearly defined as tasks on an ad hoc basis, but for me the "lose 1lb" wording works.  I could change it to "lost 1lb?" I suppose but am quite happy with it as it is.  Works for me! :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">The secret of achieving a goal like this is to give yourself lots of successes on the way. The way Christine has suggested seems to me to achieve this - though I haven't tried it myself.</div>

<div class="content">I used to be a certified fitness trainer and avid bodybuilder, going through many periods when I didn't want to lose a pound because it could have meant some very hard earned muscle was lost.  I spent a lot of time just trying to bulk up!  Maybe focusing on BF % (which can fluctuate wildly), or waist measurement would be more ideal.  There's a lot of "skinny fat" women that go to Weight Watchers, etc. where the focus is on dieting alone.  <br><br>If you consult with a good physiotherapist Christine, you can get a custom program, but there's definitely ways to exercise around an injury, whether it's deep water running with a flotation belt, swimming or focusing on upper body lifts and strengthening the leg muscles in a way that the knee isn't impacted.  If the muscles around the knee are weak, the knee joint itself is forced to work harder as the muscles aren't providing support.<br><br>I have my training listed on my AF list, specifying goals for increasing my poundage each time.    I'm not as consistent as I was when I used to do it first thing in the morning, but then my goals are more strength related than appearance now.  And I've learned through many years of experience with overtraining that I put muscle on faster when I rest more.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Many thanks for the advice - much appreciated.  Unfortunately one health problem can easily lead to another and at present, whilst waiting for hospital appointments, all I can control to any degree is more healthy eating and as the weight has gone on it is an easily measurable goal/task to lose it again (as is BF% and I will keep track of that as well - thanks for the reminder). I never thought I would miss exercise - even walking distances would be nice!</div>

<div class="content">Totally OT, but...<br><br>Check out the Jari Love exercise videos. Light weight (I use cans), high-rep weight program that gives a good cardio workout; you can leave out exercises that bother your knee. Netflix has them if you want to try before you buy. I like the "ripped and lean" and "ripped 1000" best.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, still OT, but... it really is relevant to time, since one of the reasons some people don't follow a diet  / exercise program (by that I mean "way of eating", not in a negative sense) is because of time.  I've fallen off the wagon myself by not feeling I had the time to follow anything, and it is incredibly difficult to get back on that wagon once that's happened.  Doing something little and often can help during those times.<br><br>Jari Love is a trainer in my hometown and a friend of mine has used her personal training services.  She does produce very well-coreographed programs I couldn't afford the time commitment required for programs that are geared towards women like this.  If someone likes to spend 6+ hours a week in the gym (I used to, after all), you'll be successful.  She herself trains far more than that.  I'd rather spend my 1-2 hours a week getting better results.  If you enjoy what you're doing though, that's wonderful too.  I went skiing with a 92 y.o. man who does double black diamonds 2 weeks ago, very inspiring.  <br><br>As I said before, my goals are probably different than most women - more for strength, I don't want to be feeble when I get older.  My father's 89, still does some resistance training and is going strong.  Morjorie Newlin is an 86 y.o. great grandmother who's in better shape than most 18 y.o.'s (she only started at 72) - that's what I aspire to.  <br><br>www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAUQd1xfyPs<br><a href="http://momsonthemove.tv/show_detail.asp?id=45" rel="nofollow">http://momsonthemove.tv/show_detail.asp?id=45</a><br><br>I can fit my goals into AF by just putting in ~15-20 minutes a day during the week and 1/2 hr./day on weekends.  Once I start (after promising myself I only have to do one set), it's easy to continue.  <br></div>
