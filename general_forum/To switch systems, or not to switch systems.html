<div class="content">Hi, frequent reader of these forums/blog here<br>(well, when I catch the "must improve my task/time<br>management" bug, anyway). Mainly making this post<br>as a way of getting my thoughts down and posting it<br>on this forum mainly to see if that helps spur me to any<br>sort of decision and/or gets any form of advice?<br><br>Currently using no list FVP for a very short while (two days so far)<br>as a sort of "get the file out" type of task management<br>before I start using long-list FVP or FFVP. But on the<br>other hand, no list FVP has actually been a fairly convenient<br>system to use, especially since throwing the list away with<br>the resisted root task forced me to clarify it when drawing<br>up the new list, and then made me realise that I was resisting<br>it because I was far, far less sure of what exactly was entailed<br>than I thought.<br><br>But yet again, I find myself thinking that the lack of scanning in<br>the list is kind of restrictive in some circumstances? At least with<br>handling minor urgent tasks resulting from interruptions that you can't<br>do /quite/ immediately enough to just add it to the list. So do I go ahead<br>with turning to long-list FFVP/FVP, keep at it with no-list FVP, go for<br>one-day FFVP to get the best of both worlds, or turn to something similar<br>to Seraphim's Serial No List (since I'd presume that'd go with FVP scanning<br>as well as Simple Scanning scanning)?<br><br>I suppose I should try and find a way to "get the file out" on comparing all<br>these systems, but I can't think of anything. I suppose I'll sleep on it,<br>and see if the application of no-list FVP manages to get me anywhere tomorrow.</div>

<div class="content">My approach when using NL systems is to archive my long lists, and periodically add an item to my NL system that says "Check the archives." This maintains the feeling of flexibility and speed inherent in NL systems, while still reminding me of those things that need doing but don't stay top-of-mind.</div>

<div class="content">EletricallySeeking:<br><br>If you take a look at the list of instructions of TMS on this site, one of the NL systems is "One Day FVP." That one sounds exactly like what you are searching for, me thinks.</div>

<div class="content">Voluntas:<br><br>Makes sense. I'm not starting with a long list backlog, but should be something to consider if I go <br>from one day (F)FVP to long list (F)FVP and get the urge to go back again. <br><br>Christopher:<br><br>I was aware of that possibility, and am now using one day FFVP instead. It does seem to be quite <br>workable for me so far.<br><br>Anyway, this does seem a pretty engaging way of doing things so far. Though perhaps it's a bit <br>early to say that.</div>
