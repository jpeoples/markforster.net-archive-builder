<div class="content">Hi Mark:<br><br>Just wanted to say that I love the Autofocus system! I realized that I've used it before but somehow drifted away into more complicated schemes.<br><br>One thing I've learned is the importance of not rewriting your lists. I experimented with doing a "weekly review" and rewriting everything so that it was nice and pretty. But after watching your video I realized how I was defeating the whole purpose and have now returned to the fold.<br><br>I used pink highlighter to cross out items I've worked on or finished and green highlighter to mark items that I've dismissed or reevaluated. I think the mass of color helps because it serves as a visual representation of the momentum I'm feeling and makes the items I'm avoiding really stand out. The fact that I can't "complete" the page serves as inspiration to either work on the remaining items or rethink them.<br><br>Thanks for the great idea. It's really helped me, more than GTD ever did.<br><br>Best,<br>Jennifer</div>

<div class="content">@Jennifer - I'm using a different highlighter color to make extremely urgent or items with an important deadline stand out to me too.<br><br>I agree this has been so much more helpful to me than GTD.</div>
