<div class="content">If I may...<br>There seems to be an on-going saga about what "draw a line right across it after the first block of unactioned tasks" really looks like. Even after reading several explanations, I'm still confused. <br>It could very easily be something lost in translation or interpretation, but one of the things I found very helpful for V.1 was the video where Mark was interviewed and demonstrated the finer points of the system. Maybe someone could create a graphic, do a little movie, or something that would clear up some of these "hmm's".</div>

<div class="content">I've been wondering about this, too.  The question is what does the first "block" of unactioned tasks mean?  I think that it means the oldest unactioned task left on your list, and any that are in line right after it, up until the next deleted task.<br><br>Like if your first page is like this:<br><br>A: done<br>B: undone<br>C: undone<br>D: done<br>E: undone<br><br>You'd draw the line after task C, with tasks B & C being the first "block".<br><br>That's my best guess.</div>

<div class="content">What confused me was this conversation in the comments of the blog post:<br><br>Learning as I Go:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I'm confused! If I work my list sequentially without jumping around it, then the line would be drawn at the bottom of the list with ALL the unactioned items!!!!<br>PLEASE tell me that I'm wrong! I don't like to jump around so I'd be stuck with the entire list under threat except that day's task done without any jumping around.<br>Example: I have 50 items on the list. I complete the first five in succession. Does that mean that the 45 remaining are under threat unless I jump around a bit to falsely create a break?<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Mark Forster:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>You are absolutely right. But if you are just going to do your tasks in strict First In First Out order then you don't need Autofocus!<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Would only the whole first page be dismissed, not the whole list?</div>

<div class="content">That's really the one point that's not clear to me yet. Mark states in the rules specifically to draw the line *on* the first active page. But he answered learning's question like that and he said the number of items per page didn't matter in AF2, which would not be true if the number of tasks that is dismissed is dependent on it.<br><br>Probably it's not an issue in practice because you won't have too many pages without a single done item, but just for clarification I would like to know what to do with such a page when dismissing.</div>

<div class="content">I have the same problem with the line. I keep my AF list items on several large slabs of marble, so the task have more weight and I feel more responsible for them than on paper. Since I am not so skilled with the chisel, "drawing" a line might break the "page". I would like to write a line of XXXXXXXXX instead, but there is no space left between individual items. Please help.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>I've amended the instructions slightly to make it clearer. You go back to the first active page, and then draw a line after the first block of unactioned tasks (as correctly interpreted by Kathy) - regardless of whether the end of the block is still on the first active page. <br><br>So in the conversation with Learning as you go, the beginning of the block would have been on the first active page, but the end wouldn't. I hope that's clear.</div>

<div class="content">Devonian:<br><br>The normal technique with stone carving a line  is to make oblique down cuts first, then oblique up cuts, so that you have a V shaped groove. That way you won't break the block. I'd practise on a few blank pieces of stone first.<br><br>How are you planning to delete items if you are not sure of your skill at drawing lines?</div>

<div class="content">Quleczka:<br><br>The whole point of the dismissal process is that it encourages you to move back to the beginning of the list, rather than spend all your time on the last few pages. There are two ways it does this:<br><br>1) Certain items are on notice for dismissal. So to avoid having to dismiss them you need to move to the beginning of the list. While doing this you have to look at every item on the way, so that helps to keep the entire contents of the list in your mind.<br><br>2) In order to avoid having to dismiss a large number of tasks at once, you need to keep the tasks well broken up. Again that encourages you to move back so that you can chip away at any large blocks. For instance I have a block of 5 items nearly at the beginning of my list. If I don't do some of them today, they will all be on notice for dismissal tomorrow. Since they are all items I want to do, I am encouraged to do some today and some tomorrow, rather than have to do all of them tomorrow (which I might not have time for).</div>

<div class="content">"you will feel a greater urge to get that far up the list"<br><br>ok, still urge is one thing and anther thing is rule of  "standing out"  :)<br><br>lets assume that my list have 7 pages... most of them still with quite a lot of items and this one item is at page number 8... (counting down, current page is 1, older ones are 2,3,4...)<br><br>there is quite big change that there will be a lot of newer items "standing out" and then you are for example already on page number 7... you find something to do you and...<br><br>you have to start again on page 1.... <br><br>so that's why I was asking if there is some special "priority" to do the items in the "on notice" section or do we still have to reach them in normal way?</div>

<div class="content">My previous post was written before I saw you reply Mark.<br><br>"it encourages you to move back to the beginning of the list" ...does it mean that I  can skip some items on previous pages which "stand out" in some way for me? Just decide that "on notice" items "stand out" more for me ;)<br><br>"Since they are all items I want to do, I am encouraged to do some today and some tomorrow, rather than have to do all of them tomorrow"<br><br>If these items get to my "on notice" section tomorrow  and I even have enough time to do all 5 of them.... I still have 7 or 8 pages with other items... so do I have to make all other "standing out" items from previous pages or can I just do these 5 if I want?<br><br>I was understand always "stand out" rule as finding items you somehow feel like doing right now... from what you write it looks like now I should be choosing items based more on some kind of calculation for example  that  choosing this item is making my tomorrow "on notice" section smaller etc.</div>

I think you alluded to this in another post where you commented that you had tried a blend of AF1 and AF2 for dismissing items.<br><br>Is the 'block' system something that you found to be self correcting in nature (ie a period of entering a high volume of tasks will eventually lead to larger dismissal blocks and end up preventing the list from continuing to grow) or is there a case for overriding it occasionally by reverting to something closer to AF1 where whole pages (or several blocks) may be dismissed simultaneously.<br><br>Only asking the question at this time because, after some 'catchup' dismissing, I've started using AF2 on my existing AF1 list.  However, I can still see this possibly being an issue after a few weeks of use.   <br><br>Anyway, overall I really like the feel of the AF2 system after a whole day of use!<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Andy<br> <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Zane - just to clarify, this is not a suggested tweak although you're right, I'm sure there will be a number over the coming weeks :).  I've been using AF1 successfully since Feb with only the index card tweak for urgent items.  I'm all for implementing Mark's carefully thought out instructions as I tend to think that most tweaks are likely to dilute the effectiveness of the system.  <br><br>However, just generally interested in Mark's thoughts on this particular issue although I'm sure it would also become apparent to me after using AF2 for a number of weeks.  <br><br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">"If any of them are not actioned by the start of the next day, they are dismissed..."<br><br>I think a small, but important issue was clarified in this thread for me today. Working on any one or more item in the block saves it from dismissal. There is no necessity to complete all of the items in the block, although there is an incentive to do so.<br><br>For eg, I have a line drawn under a block of three open tasks, above and below of which are completed tasks. The act of completing the lowermost task only for that day moves the line upwards to the other two open tasks, which are now threatened for the following day. Does that sound right Mark?<br><br>By the same token, broken up tasks expose fewer blocks for dismissal, as Mark mentions here. <br><br>A lazy Sunday spent on AF 2 found me furiously adding tasks to the end of the list. It is so much easier to do this, knowing that they will tackled soon. I find myself breaking down my tasks a lot more, which makes the resistance to them lower. I added  36 tasks and completed 38, but a lot more focus on the urgent stuff that comes in and requires attention fast. Once I got a grip, moving further back became easier, and finally reached the threatened task. I saved it by breaking down the project into bite sized bits and moved it to the end of the list. Overall, I am noticing a faster pace.<br><br>On the subject of intuition, I initially thought that I need to be pretty sharp about what stands out to me because its a dead stop at that task and then back to the end of the list. But in practice, I found you can be wrong and get away with it, because you are constantly reviewing the list from the bottom up. If you missed it the first time, chances are your mind will engage it when you pass through it again. A lot more forgiving.<br><br>All in all, I'm having a great start.</div>

<div class="content">I don't know if JD's understanding of how to dismiss a block (or a part of it) is according to what Mark prescribes, but I like the idea anyway. I dread facing a *large* block of tasks under notice of dismissal and being forced to either dismiss them all or alternatively to rewrite them at the end of my list, if I decide to save them.<br><br>Either of the above options would be neither pleasant nor correct for me. The fact that I would save the block from dismissal by doing one of the tasks (or partially doing it and moving it forward) is more logical. The following day the rest of the not yet done tasks would be on the likely to be dismissed list anyway and I would have a chance to either push forward to completing any of them or failing that, ultimately to dismiss them. The critical fact is that every day I would have to deal with at least one of the tasks in the block, until the whole block is cleared by doing the tasks or dismissing a part of the block.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Mark. Personally, I'm going to follow the AF 2 rules "to the T" for the month of July. No tweaks. And then decide if a tweak is needed.

In AF1, I would keep the list manageable by occasionally dismissing several consecutive pages of tasks which didn't stand out (although my criteria for standing out became a little looser during those periods..).<br><br>The perceived lessening of flexibility in dismissing enough items in AF2 compared to AF1 has been my only initial concern.<br><br>However, as with most concerns at this early stage, I'm sure this will work itself out given sufficient practice/time.<br><br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Avrum and Mark for clearing that up. I have not put any large block of tasks on notice, thankfully, as I've only had a block of one  to deal with on my first day. Good to have that straigtened up before I do face something like that.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">And thanks Frank for that example - it helped to underline the logic behind the dismissal rule.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>"I suggest you try it out as per the instructions. I think the problem you are concerned about will prove more apparent than real."<br><br>For sure I will :) I was just thinking if I should start with clean new system or the old one...with old one I'm really that it will be difficult to reach the last page...if you have to start from the beginning each time :)</div>

<div class="content">I've switched to AF2 using my old AF1 list, and so far that's working quite nicely. I had a total of 27 pages (with lots of completed tasks on most), and it's going to take some effort to reach the beginning of the list, but I'm feeling less overwhelmed that I was a few days ago because I have a better grasp of really urgent stuff that ends up on the last active page.  I guess my feeling of overwhelm was mainly caused by the fact that with AF1 I was never when I was going to reach the last active page for the really urgent stuff. With AF2 I don't have that concern anymore, so it's definitely an improvement for me.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Wearing my dusty old Quantum Theorist hat for a moment, I would say it is a tricky business dealing with cats as they can end up in non-deterministic states i.e. neither alive nor dead.<br><br>And attempting to feed a cat that may or may not be alive could cause havoc with my AF2 dismissal process, and ultimately may have severe consequences for the fabric of space-time, and the existence of the universe in general.<br><br>(For those that haven't the slightest idea what I'm yapping on about, I refer you to the following: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat</a> )</div>

<div class="content">Frank,<br><br>Yeah, but I really do doubt that whole experiment.  First of all, you'd have to sit around waiting for the cat to DECIDE to hop into the box on his own ... there is little chance of stuffing him in there if it is not HIS idea to go in ... and almost impossible to do without breaking that glass apparatus and getting cyanide all over the lab ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Frank<br><br>I do take your point but think it is largely irrelevant here, although it does raise the question as to whether the state of the cat would alter depending upon whether you were actually looking at it at the time you attempted to feed it ..........<br><br>However, in my opinion, which of course is not necessarily considered, well not quantumly anyway, if you had rephrased "Feed Cat" to "Make Cat Climb Everest For Food", under AF1 rules (which I assume still apply when considering how an item is actually "actioned") the act of rephrasing would have caused the item to have been actioned and therefore it would not be dismissed.<br><br>Similarly, Mark's example, by the arrangement of the feeding of Kittykins (which of course is the abbrevieted name of Furzyworzylovekins) whilst away climbing Everest, would have also rephrased and therefore actioned the task.<br><br>Gee it's good to be back!!!!  :-)</div>
