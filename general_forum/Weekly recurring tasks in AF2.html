<div class="content">I can see how Autofocus handles daily or irregularly recurring tasks such as exercise, but what about weekly ones, such as 'do weekly review'? Say I do the review, cross it off and rewrite it at the end of the list. Then I won't want to do it again for another seven days, but still want to be reminded of it. <br><br>Several days later I look for the first block of unactioned tasks, including my weekly review. I draw the line underneath, so putting them all  'on notice'. The next day, I'm still not at the end of the week, I don't want to do the review, so the review would get dismissed, according to the rules.<br><br>The simplest answer, I guess, it to make it a calendar item? Or is there a better solution? Or am I missing something obvious (again)?</div>

<div class="content">I'm using an electronic approach and, for this, I'm just filtering the list for tasks that I can start now. For a weekly review task, I would schedule it recurring so it can only start in a week from now and therefore not show up in my list until then.<br><br>For a manual approach, I think the equivalent would be to use a tickler file which you check daily.<br><br>Putting these items on your calendar will quickly swamp it, I think.</div>

<div class="content">Frank<br>Yes I think you are right. I tried various ways of handling this kind of recurring task in AF1 and nothing worked very well. Then I scheduled them on the calendar instead which was messy and also brought out my rebellious side, 'I don't WANT TO check my bank accounts at 7.30pm,  I want to do do it at 8pm instead!"<br><br>My low-tech solution (having abandoned my PDA some weeks ago) is to stick a couple of fluorescent Post-It notes inside the front cover of my notebook. One is for weekly recurring tasks and the other for a morning/evening checklist. I've put the task 'Check Post-Its' in my task list to remember to look at them each day!</div>

<div class="content">Linda:<br><br>The way I handle this type of recurring task (weekly or monthly etc) is to put a reminder in Outlook Tasks. When the task appears I dismiss the task for a week or month or whatever the appropriate period is and write the task at the end of my AF list.<br><br>So the reminder is not to do the task, but to put it back on the list.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark<br><br>I think this way of handling recurring tasks is going to make it much easier to work the AF list. So often I was skimming tasks saying 'no, I did that one the other day, don't need to do it again yet . . ' and so the tasks I COULD be doing were not standing out.<br><br>After only two days, I'm really getting to like AF2 - been very productive today!</div>

<div class="content">I've been setting up recurring tasks in a tickler list in Remember the Milk.  They have a firefox add-on that allows me to have my RTM tickler show up in gmail.  Since gmail is always open, I can glance at my tickler list and tackle those items first.  They repeat on their set schedule.  I only use this for things that have real due dates like returning library books or birthday reminders.  Anything else like cleaning chores that don't have to be done on a specific day get put into AF.  This helps me track dated info without cluttering up my calendar.</div>

<div class="content">You could try www.memotome.com It will send you e-mail reminders.  It has the advantage of being very simple.</div>

<div class="content">Rainer:<br><br>Well, that's what it means. But I would get tired of writing "Put weekly task ... on AF List", so in general I just put "XYZ".</div>

<div class="content">My system for weekly tasks is very similar to "the Maestro" 's, but I use a paper-based solution: I have a weekly schedule for things that I would like to do on a specific day of the week, such as Weekly Review, do laundry, pay bills, etc. Every morning before I start working the AF2 list, I look at the schedule and enter the tasks for that day of the week into AF. Works great.</div>

<div class="content">Elsewhere I described my "every" lists.  I have one page which contians the following lists (in very terse format:<br><br>- Things I do EVERY DAY (both by hour and not assigned a particular time)<br>- Things I do EVERY WEEK (by day of week)<br>- Things I do EVERY MONTH (by day of month)<br>- Things I do EVERY YEAR (by date)<br><br>The last includes things which are not due EVERY year but on the same date every so many years.  (Like "renew passport" which comes up every 10 years ... next in October of 2013 ... and "renew driver's license" which comes up every forth year, and "renew car registration" which comes up every other year, etc.)<br><br>At a glance I can see what is on the horizon while not having to leaf through a calendar to notice them.  I might ALSO put them on the calendar so I'll see blocked time, for example, and not schedule something to conflict.<br><br>If you are smaller format based (as I am, mostly) you could make up an index card for each category and need only four of them ... and they also come in pretty florescent colors ;-)</div>
