<div class="content">Forgive me if I've missed this question, but the one part of the Autofocus directions I don't understand is to return to the "first active page" if you finish the last page.  If you're not to leave a page until everything on it is either completed or dismissed, why would there be an active page earlier than the one you're on?  Thanks for clarification on this, and thanks for a very useful approach.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Anne<br><br>You scan the first page and do the first item that stands out, then continue down the page to the next item that stands out, and continue circling the page until no items jump out at you. At that point you can move on to the next page.  The only requirement is that you should do at least one item on the page but do not need to do more than that one if no further items stand out on that pass.  It is only if no items at all stand out on the *first pass* that all open items are dismissed.<br><br>Hope that helps .....</div>

<div class="content">Anne:<br><br>Christine is right. Nowhere in the instructions does it say that you are not to leave a page until everything on it is either completed or dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, a quick note on marking the first active page, which I didn't quite get clear to myself when I read the instructions.<br><br>I've changed it slightly as follows and it appears clearer for me. When I start I mark the first page with a red circle in the top corner - this marks the first active page. Once all activities are completed or highlighted I put a criss-cross through the circle and add a circle to the second page. <br><br>This way the first active page is always clear - there's a red circle at the top!<br><br>Regards<br>Jonathan</div>
