Spartan shame is communal; it’s enforced from without, by the community. The kind of shame we need is different. It’s harder. Ours has to be internal. Self-imposed. Because our failings are so frequently acted out in private, inside our own hearts, with no witness but ourselves, we ourselves have to take responsibility."</div>

<div class="content">He is basically just restating the common observation of shame versus guilt cultures.<br><br>Guilt is internalized sense of failure and disappointment. Shame failure and disappointment as judged by those around you. To make a gross observation.<br><br>Just in the NT you can see the beginning of the move from shame to guilt. Jesus often speaking to developing a sense of guilt rather than shame. Sinning in our heart the same as committing the sin. What comes out of the mouth greater than what goes into it, those who have sinned without the community knowing about it being as wrong as the sinner who sins shameless in the community (first stone and all).<br><br>Kant wrote some interesting stuff on the gradually shift in the Western World from shame to guilt and this shift's relationship to Europeanizing of Christianity. Specifically a guilt without knowing exactly what transgression one particularly committed. Original guilt displacing original sin.<br><br>Most Mediterranean cultures and members of their diasporas still operate primarily in a shame based manner. Hence the stereotype of the typical Jewish mother.<br><br>In American Irish Catholicism you get worst of both worlds. <br><br>This is another instance where breaking out Homer, Aeschylus, Augustine, Kant, Nietzsche, Freud, Philip Roth, and Larry David, etc. is greater than reading another blog.<br><br>In short, we Westerns for the most part are riddled with guilt and shame. I am not sure developing any more of it or "other" kinds would be very helpful, even if Spartans are really cool at the moment.</div>

<div class="content">Nietzsche:<br>"They call you heartless: but you have a heart, and I love you for being ashamed to show it. You are ashamed of your flood, while others are ashamed of their ebb."</div>

<div class="content">Stephen Pressfield is a good analyst on the creative process, who believes in the Muses. I recommend his book The War of Art.</div>

<div class="content">Shame in this context presumably equates to "It's fine as long as you don't get found out"?</div>

<div class="content">>>> Spartan shame is communal<br><br>As always, history is complex and difficult to read. Where the "walls of Sparta" (because Sparta was the only Greek city with no defensive walls ) mainly driven by shame or by nothing (the missing walls,  no place to run)? Is it like going to your requiem before boarding or burning your ships when arriving?  Is the motor of bushido shame or acceptance?  OK I stop,  I admit I spent to many years performing Taoist rituals,  bowing for foreign gods.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Laurence,<br><br>I enjoyed The War of Art as well, and it sounds like he's thinking about coming out with a sequel of sorts.  And his historical fiction is first rate of course.<br><br>In Pressfield's writing, his view of shame is as a motivator - as in "you are better than this".  Whether that's being dishonorable, or even not doing what you know to be the 'right' thing to do - in your work or otherwise.  So it's the opposite of doing the right thing only if you'll be found out.<br><br>It seems that in some circles today, the loss of shame as a tool to control society isn't necessarily a good thing.  There's a reason why we watch shows like Jerry Springer or reality shows where people do dishonest or ignoble things and look away like it's a train wreck.  <br><br>Damien, you're partly correct that in that they had to build a strong society that would support the cities at all costs.  The army of Sparta was its walls.  If you like the period but find it difficult (or boring) to read the straight historical stuff, I'd check out his novel "Gates of Fire".  It was an excellent read.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster:<br><br>"Shame in this context presumably equates to "It's fine as long as you don't get found out"?"<br><br>That is what shame is. Especially when seen in the ancient Mediterranean. If you read literature from the period, it is pretty clear that the virtue, better translated as "excellence", (arete) of one's behavior didn't make much sense outside one's relations within the City State nor the possibility of "happiness" (eudaimonia).<br><br>When Aristotle writes: "Man is (by nature) a (the) political animal." He means that outside the relationship to the polis, man is not. One's "private" actions or thoughts do not come in question much in antiquity.<br><br>Now what actions were considered shameful were at times highly contested. Take a look at the greatest misanthrope of all time Diogenes the Cynic. "Dog"-like and an advocate of an arete rooted in "nature" as the only possible path to eudamonia, he still made his home in the agora.<br><br>As the rise of private life increased throughout the Western world and growing importance of the home (oikos), the emphasis on guilt grew as well. <br><br>As mentioned above, the teachings of Jesus cannot be underestimated in this turn of events.<br><br>IMHO of course. This was pretty much Nietzsche's analysis of the moral development of the West taken up by Freud to understand the development of a person. <br><br>Shame -> Guilt</div>

<div class="content">Norman:<br><br>I was interested enough in what you said to look up how many times the Bible mentions "guilt", and found that it only uses it in the forensic sense of being guilty of a crime. It isn't used to mean an "internalised sense of failure and disappointment" in either the Old or New Testaments.<br><br>I don't think Jesus was talking about that either, but rather that there should be no difference between what we present on the outside and what we are thinking internally. "Integrity" is the best word I can think of to describe it. His betes noires were people who were like whitewashed sepulchres - beautiful on the outside and full of bones and corruption on the inside.</div>

More than a few here seem to have some sorta explicit Biblical education. <br><br>I would hate to see this turn into a verse throwing thread (I doubt that you or Mel would do such a thing). <br><br>I have read around the literature and genesis of shame and guilt in the West and think that it is unfortunate that many people who read the Jewish and Christian scriptures read them strictly through the lenses our understanding of guilt and shame.<br><br>Just a quick comment on your second paragraph. I might not have been clear in stating my point or clear in mis-stating it. I do not think that Jesus is arguing for or are his arguments examples of our contemporary understanding of guilt. Rather, I believe that Jesus' teachings mark an increasing turn toward interiority of understanding sin and virtue (arete). This emphasis on interiority certainly was one of the elements which made his teachings shocking to many of the Jews who heard his words.</div>

<div class="content">It's true than when I'm under a deadline shame can be a motivator.<br>But in general the best motivator to keep working is being fascinated by the work itself.</div>

<div class="content">Norman: I AM a verse thrower. Here you go: Matthew 23: 26Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.<br><br> 27"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. 28In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.<br><br>Now are these words of Jesus intended to induce guilt, shame, repentance, or was He just baiting them to kill Him? Are these words only for the hearers or for us also? I highly recommend that you read the Book of books. No course of study is required; just humility. Not sure you have the prereq.</div>
