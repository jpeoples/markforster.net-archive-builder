<div class="content">I am brand-new and haven't started yet. I read the introductory e-mail message and I've read many posts here, including the FAQ that linked to some older posts. There is still one thing I really don't understand: Do I list activities that I do regularly no matter what?<br><br>Example of something that happens on a schedule: Riding lessons<br>Example of something that doesn't have a particular time, but happens almost every day: Cooking dinner, physical therapy exercises.<br><br>It seems like if I list these, I will just keep writing, highlighting and rewriting over and over. Yet while reading, some people were talking about listing things like doing the dishes. That's also something that I would do a few times a day.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Caryn<br><br>As I understand it, you don't list scheduled activities - these can go in your diary, if you do things regularly then you don't need them in AF, unless you think you might forget.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Caryn,<br><br>I wasn't noting any tasks that I did automatically, eg 'empty dishwasher' or 'apply make-up'. Then, on the advice of another beta tester, I started doing it earlier this week. The more things I cross off my current list, the greater the sense of momentum, I find. It's made a palpable difference to the speed and enthusiasm with which I tackle those tasks I was previously resisting.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Caryn:<br><br>My advice would be to start working the system and only then worry about details like this. It's much easier to get a feel for what works for you while actually doing it, rather than theorising about it in advance.<br><br>And you might want to read what the instructions say about highlighting again. From what you've said, I don't think you've got it right.</div>

<div class="content">UPDATE: I decided to just list non-scheduled, non-automatic things. After all, it's the unscheduled things that you tend to procrastinate about or lose track of. It's working very well. I am especially enjoying my clear e-mail inbox.<br><br>Yes, I mixed up the highlighting and crossing-out in my question!</div>
