<div class="content">I'm Starting a new list and I have only part of one page so far. I think the rules ought to be clarified for the startup phase. <br><br>As written, it seems like I should reenter stuff on page 2, but I think that's incorrect and the "next page" is actually page 1. Confusing. <br><br> Following the rules, I may write a few things down, alternate between a couple, add an urgent item, etc., and completely fill column 2 before I even come up with 30 nonurgent tasks.  Now I'm in trouble. <br><br>As long as only one page exists, there's little point fretting over whether something is active, urgent, unfinished, reentered because all tasks on the page are available.  So I'd suggest to simplify, everything goes column 1 until I have a second page started. <br><br>Yet I shall attempt to abide the rules as written.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I don't actually agree that it seems as if you should re-enter stuff on p. 2, because it says:<br><br>"If you are on the last page, then go back to the beginning of the list and re-enter the task in Column 2 of the first active page."<br><br>I don't see how that could be interpreted as being anything other than p. 1.</div>

<div class="content">I agree except it's easy to miss that statement, and it's weird that the next page means the current page. <br><br>But for the larger point, is anyone else getting muddled over new vs urgent vs recurring vs unfinished when starting up? It's like a big todo (pun) about nothing.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>It's certainly not about nothing as far as unfinished tasks are concerned. An unfinished task has to be worked on before you can start working on the next page (and there will eventually be a next page).</div>
