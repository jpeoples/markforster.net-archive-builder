<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2013-05-14 18:52</div>
<div class="content">There were a few posts on the culling of paperwork / files on this thread:<br><a href="../general_forum/The Repeat Test and Personal Kanban.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2114490</a><br><br>I wanted to share my experience with this, since I've finally found a simple approach that seems to work very well for me, with very low overhead.<br><br>If there are very important or unique documents, I file them in a special place -- titles, deeds, birth certificates, passports, etc.   <br><br>I also keep a special separate file for annual tax returns and supporting documents.<br><br>I also keep a handful of files that seem to need special treatment.  For example, I have a file for each of our vehicles, with maintenance records, etc.   <br><br>But everything else goes into one place:   an accordion file with monthly dividers.   If I have a paper and I am not sure where to file it, I just throw it in there.    It is now May, so all the papers get filed there in the May slot.<br><br>I use the same accordion file on an ongoing basis, year after year.  In other words, the slots for June through December are already filled up with stuff from last year.   <br><br>So here is how I cull:<br><br>When the first of the month comes around, I pull out all the papers from the accordion slot for that month, and quickly go through them.   Eighty percent of it gets thrown away.   A few items seem important enough to keep:  perhaps receipts for large payments; some bank statements; some insurance paperwork; some unique documents or project records or photos.   So, I keep all that in a folder for the last year.<br><br>Example:   On or before June 1st, I will pull all the papers from the June slot of my accordion file.   These are papers that I filed there in June 2012.   I will go through them and decide what to keep and what to toss.   Almost all of it gets tossed.   If I keep anything, it goes into a single separate file for 2012.   I'll keep that file indefinitely.   <br><br>I could easily keep 20 years of records in a single file box with this method.   <br><br>Most of those records I will never need - but it DOES happen sometimes that I need some file that I stored away two or three years ago, or even earlier.   It's pretty easy to find, since I generally know the approximate time-frame, and there aren't very many papers to look through.<br><br>Since it is done monthly and regularly, the process is very low overhead.    And it's actually enjoyable -- it's a short "trip down memory lane" reminding me of what we were doing in our life a year ago.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>This sounds like a great idea!  I've been following the guidance of David Allen and keeping general-reference file folders, stored in alphabetical order.  That approach worked well when I started, and all my files comprised only one or two file drawers.  I could find anything quickly, even if I had to hunt a bit to remember which topic name I used.  But my home files have now grown to take up a four-drawer filing cabinet, and the drawers are getting full.  I really don't want to add a fifth drawer.  I might try your method, but it will probably require a free weekend to cull the existing files, if I want to get on top of everything  in one go.  This type of change doesn't seem like a good candidate for little-and-often processing.<br><br>If I understand your suggestion, you have an extremely limited set of topic-specific file folders, and everything else goes into monthly archive folders for the past 12 months.  Anything older, that doesn't belong in one of the topic-specific folders, gets trashed or put into the corresponding yearly archive folder (i.e. '2012' '2011' '2010' …)  Is that the idea?<br><br>(This approach is reminiscent of incremental computer backup strategies, e.g. Apple's Time Machine.)</div>

<div class="content">Ideas for anything you want filed by topic. I've seen each of these work in different offices, but admit that none of them seem to work for me at home.<br><br>Some work better for reference, others work better when you can quickly deal with all expired papers at once, such as a business's tax records. Some are more tolerant of delays when purging than others.<br><br>They all take longer than "throw everything I touched today into the same folder." <br><br>Method 1:<br><br>Add date stickers as you touch each file. If you can always tidy each file when you touch it, great! Otherwise add another sticker (again, date based) when you tidy the file.<br><br>Eventually, it will be easy to see which files haven't been touched (or tidied) in the last five years, and dealing with them can be a little-and-often project, starting with drawer 1. If that review takes two years, drawer 1 might have things that are 7 years old before you get back to it, but the system won't break. Just keep track of where you are in the review, so you don't restart with file A after every pause.<br><br>Not good if you need to file or destroy all files of a certain age, such as financial or medical records.<br><br>When I used this method, I didn't have an out for when I touched a file without tidying it. Very frustrating.<br><br>Method 2:<br><br>Start a new shelf every year or two. As you touch a file, tidy and move it to the new shelf. Anything still on the old shelf hasn't been touched since the new one started. This works well if you rarely refer to older papers. It works very well if you can eventually move everything left on the shelf to the same place (long-term storage or garbage) in one session.<br><br>This method doesn't work if you can't always tidy a file when you touch it, or if you don't know when you last touched the file you need, or if you tend to change category names every time you create a folder.<br><br>If you change filing systems too often, you end up with a messy version of this one.<br><br>Method 3:<br><br>Start a whole new set of files each year, inter-woven with the old files (different colour for each year, sorted by topic). You can create the new folders all at once, or as you need them. This has all the benefits both methods 1 and 2. The system doesn't break if you use a file without reviewing it. You have the option of leaving older files in the system (with "date reviewed" on the file),or removing them to storage (or garbage), or you can combine them with the current folder as you review them. It's almost as easy as method 2 if you have to move an entire year to storage or the garbage. Topics with only a few pages that need to be kept for a long time might have a lot of folders, but they can be merged.<br><br>Method 4:<br><br>Start a new set of files each year, as in method 3, but put the new files on a new shelf. A bit faster if you move a year's worth out at the same time, but otherwise much the same. Same downside as method 2 if you create new category names too easily.</div>

<div class="content">I've got a plastic box with a snap on lid.  In there I have those clear plastic wallets you put in lever arch files.  Each wallet contains related docs, eg car docs, insurance docs, employment stuff, which I write on the wallet with a permanent marker so I can find it easily in the box.<br><br>I chuck new docs on top of the box and once or twice a year update the folders and shred anything I don't need.  Fully referenceable and takes around 2 hours per year to maintain.</div>

<div class="content">@ubi - Yes, you've got the basic idea.<br><br>@Cricket - I've never been able to maintain a filing system with so many rules.  :-)     I just don't have time, and find that the cost isn't worth the benefit.   An office with lots of files (such as the college financial aid office I worked at ~30 years ago) needs clearly-defined systems and procedures for handling files, and I tried duplicating those for home use, but really, I am not running a financial aid office and don't need the overhead.  :-)<br><br>@Chris - That's pretty much the same thing that I do with the few files that need to be set aside in some special way.   But I keep them in a fireproof filing cabinet, and I file things as they come along.   They take up about half of one drawer.   I agree, it's easy to find things, and takes very little time to maintain.   I think the problems start happening when I try to apply this method to ALL of my files, which is overkill.</div>

<div class="content">Each type of file, and each type of office, needs a different system. That's why I ended up with so many choices. Things you need to refer to often or find quickly are worth investing more time up front, and more overhead. Things you need rarely are worth much less investment up front.<br><br>I find financial and identity papers easy to file. They have a clear date and category. I don't wonder whether I'll be able to read them in a year. Notes from meetings, though, are a pain. They have a clear date, but they're messy.</div>

<div class="content">A few years ago, I started putting new notes on EverNote. Today I think that's part of my problem.<br><br>It's easy to tidy paper notes, regardless of source, and throw them in a file, even taking the extra step to sort by subject. It's harder to scan pages or read and type them.<br><br>Tentative plan: File new notes (and filing backlog) in the old system.<br><br>As for the two years of notes (350) are in EverNote, leave them there for now. Not ideal, but they're safe. Eventually print and file them. Wait long enough that most will be deleted rather than filed.<br><br>Many of my projects are done via email. It's easy to search. Yes, it means I might need to check both email and paper files, but that's better than email, paper and EverNote.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br><< As for the two years of notes (350) are in EverNote, leave them there for now. Not ideal, but they're safe. Eventually print and file them. Wait long enough that most will be deleted rather than filed.>><br><br>Sounds as if you are moving in precisely the opposite direction to me!<br><br>I am am gradually converting to filing all new paperwork in Evernote. I find it much easier to file the paper and find it again when it's held electronically.<br><br>The most important factor was buying a decent scanner. I got a Doxie <a href="http://www.getdoxie.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.getdoxie.com/</a> and it's brilliant. It fits easily into a briefcase or bag and doesn't need either a power source or a computer to be able to scan. I take it to meetings with me, write notes on small unlined cards and scan them straight into Doxie.<br><br>I use keywords extensively, but only use the Notebooks in Evernote to group together documents which I am currently working on. Otherwise I just file everything in General.<br><br>You can use To Do boxes to mark up documents which need further action.<br><br>One of the most useful features of having a document in Evernote is that you can immediately send it by email to someone without having to scan it again. You can also make any document available on-line for anyone who has the link to see or download:<br><br><a href="http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/d46fabd8-9521-4b92-9376-ce6542126c74/ac0afc7a8cf299baa5bc93086531b0df" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/d46fabd8-9521-4b92-9376-ce6542126c74/ac0afc7a8cf299baa5bc93086531b0df</a><br><br>And it's easy to forward your email to Evernote so everything is in the same place.<br><br>What's not to like?</div>
