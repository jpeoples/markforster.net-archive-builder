<div class="content">I haven't followed the discussion forum lately, so this question may has already been asked. I'm is using AF4 daily, but wondering if there are any explanation behind AF4. Why is it a good tool? In AF1 there were some explanation behind the system why it should work. I haven't seen that for AF4.<br><br>Hans V</div>
