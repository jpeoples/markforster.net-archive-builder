<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>I truly hope that you are busy researching and/or experimenting (or even on holiday) rather than still suffering from back pain. I truly hope all is well with you. If not, my prayers are with you hoping for your earlist recovery.<br>vickie<br></div>

<div class="content">I got an email from Mark just three days ago as an answer to a query I sent him, so I hope there is nothing to worry about.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to everyone who has expressed concern about my wellbeing. I am in fact perfectly ok - just being lazy, which is one of the benefits of being semi-retired!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>I'm SO GLAD to hear that you're doing well!  But I have a small sticking point with your reply......<br><br>Since when is enjoying life as you wish necessarily being lazy?  You're simply using your well-earned right to focus on whatever you like even if that involves enjoying the sensations of being in a hammock!  LOL!  ENJOY!!!  We'll next hear from you when it's right for you!<br>vickie</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Your attitude makes me giggle because my very British father also believed that time was wasted when you're not accomplishing something.  Fortunately his Gaelic wife and his 5 half-bred children were willing to devote YEARS in teaching him how to guiltlessly enjoy our annual month at the seaside resort which he felt good about earning for his family yet, felt guilty to enjoy!  LOL! ENJOY your retirement with the same intensity of fervor that you used for your profession!<br>Think Gaelic!  LOL!<br>vickie</div>

<div class="content">Hi Vickie<br><br>I said I was being lazy, not that I was wasting time.<br><br>Very different things!<br><br>See <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/5/14/in-praise-of-doing-nothing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/5/14/in-praise-of-doing-nothing.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>LOL!  This relates quite well to your posting today.  I define lazy as not doing what you're supposed to be doing.  I define relaxing as just that (not as escape from something else....it's merits are in the relaxing itself!)  Semantics do play a huge role....I love your posting today to be more mindful in how we use language in our own minds as well!  In fact, I think I might use that as one of my journaling subjects to excavate my own internal language and how I interpret my own language and their implied definitions and CUES!<br>Thanks again for that brilliant insight!<br>vickie<br></div>
