<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-17 19:03</div>
<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br><br>I hope no one will hate me for this ... I stumbled upon AF through the Lifehacker article and was immediately hooked by its simple elegance. I started filling a lined pocket moleskine, but soon found myself wondering how I could use AF digitally. Since none of the available options seemed quite right to me, I decided to implement my own digital autofocus system.<br><br>I have reasonable skills in PHP and MySQL, so I downloaded the latest version of Zend Framework and got coding. Four days later, I had a basic system that does most things I need. Then I decided to share my work with anybody who was interested, added user accounts and uploaded it all to freshly registered domain.<br><br>So now I'd like to invite everyone to test it out: <a href="http://autofocus.cc" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc</a><br><br>Features as far:<br>- Add tasks to end of list (duh)<br>- Configurable amount of tasks per page<br>- Re-add done or dismissed tasks with one click<br>- Jump to next page OR jump to next active page<br>- Forces you to do at least one task or dismiss page (Some people will not like that one)<br><br>Here is a screenshot: <a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/img/screenshot.png" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/img/screenshot.png</a><br><br>It's not perfect, it doesn't look too good yet (I designed it with mobile devices with low resolutions in mind, I plan to make a shinier and faster AJAX-Version), it may explode the moment more than two people it. With you help, I will try to bring it closer to being a good autofocus implementation, if ...<br><br>Mark, I hope you are okay with me doing this. I kinda got carried away, and now I realize that you might be against this. If you don't want me to host this service, especially under the autofocus.cc name or at all, I understand and promise to take it down immediately. I didn't want to steal your ideas or anything, I give you full credit on the page, I just thought it would be cool to have an AF web app instead of the nth GTD web app.<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-17 19:33</div>
<div class="content">@Christian: Thanks!<br><br>Here's where I want to go from here:<br><br>- Split into desktop and mobile version. Mobile version stays as is, perhaps adjustments for touch devices like IPhone, e.g. bigger buttons. Desktop version gets better layout and AJAX for faster response (currently it reloads the whole page on every action).<br><br>- Options to blend out done and dismissed items (optionally older than x minutes)<br><br>- Special "review dismissed" mode<br><br>- Option to be able to "cheat" (= jump to next page without doing/dismissing)<br><br>- Separate list for timed tasks, showing them above the af list *if* they are about to begin<br><br>If you have other suggestions or find some bugs, let me know! Thanks again!<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>

<div class="content">Very nice! And it probably already has almost everything you need to get AF up and running. Pretty impressive for a few days of work. A great alternative to "hacking" web apps that were meant for GTD or generic task management. Thanks! <br><br>My suggestions: <br><br>- Display the page creation date at the top of the list. The instructions say that you should write down the date every time you create the first new task of a day, but I don't think that's necessary. Maybe there could be the creation date of the first and last task of the page at the top. <br><br>- To leverage one of the major advantages of a digital solution, display both timed and immediate/"same day" tasks above/at the top of the AF list.<br><br>- Keyboard shortcuts.<br><br>Bug? Didn't find any except a strange error message when I tried to login for the first time (IE 7), but it didn't happen again.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-17 20:12</div>
<div class="content">Alex:<br><br>Thanks for the suggestions! I'll definitely add Dates and Keyboard Shortcuts (I love them in gmail) to my list. Time specific tasks are already on there. ;-)<br><br>Concerning browser compatibility, IE7 still has a few flaws, it seems to work as intended in Firefox 2 and 3, Opera 9.6, Chrome and Safari. I didn't dare to check it in IE6 yet. :-\</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-17 20:13</div>
<div class="content">Two more suggestions: <br><br>- A way to backup to a local plain text file on my own computer (very important for me, I won't use any web app without that). <br><br>- Add a combined "Done and Re-add" button (that does what it says) next to the "Done" button. That will save a click and a page refresh.</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-17 20:23</div>
<div class="content">Alex:<br><br>User Backup's a good idea, too. How about, additionally to a manual download, the option to get your task list mailed to you daily or x times a day? You can just let your mail program filter it in some folder/label, and you're always up-to-date if something goes wrong.<br><br> I originally wanted to make special recurring tasks, that automatically get re-added. A separate button takes up valuable space - on a mobile phone that is, it's a non-issue for the desktop version.</div>

<div class="content">This is just my reaction. (Mark Forster is much more gracious and generous than I am). And I’m speaking as an artist. Taking Mark’s system and making another version of it publicly available without apparent permission or licensing goes beyond fair use and is, in my opinion, a violation of Mark’s intellectual property rights. Far better to contact Mark and discuss a possible web application with him first, before posting it publicly.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-17 20:41</div>
<div class="content">Andreas, <br><br>emailing the task list is a great idea. That way, one could print out the whole list if necessary and take it out and about without needing web access. <br><br>Re the separate button: IMO, the saved load times would outweigh the use of additional screen estate. How about only using single letters for the mobile version instead of entire words (like "D" for "Done" and "R" for "Re-Add")? Dismissing, on the other hand, only needs a single button for the whole page, as implemented. An alternative would be using simple symbols instead of words/letters (like a checkoff mark, circled arrow etc.). <br><br>Regarding time-specific tasks: I can't find that function.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-17 20:51</div>
<div class="content">Liz:<br><br>Perhaps you're right. It was a bad decision on my part. I didn't think it through. I thought it would be okay as long as I don't charge anything for it and give Mark credit, but this probably doesn't fall under fair use. I should have checked with Mark beforehand, I will do so right now. I will take it down if he wants me to. I apologize for any inconvenience.<br><br>Alex:<br><br>Timed tasks are already on the todo list, not already implemented in the todo list.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not so sure a simple procedure is or can be copyrighted. Maybe it can be patented, but I'm not sure about that one either. My impression is that it is legal to use the method for derivative work after it has been originally published. <br><br>But after all, I'm not an IP lawyer. Mark, you should probably consult one ASAP. Not to go after Andreas, but to protect your work as effectively as possible.</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-17 21:56</div>
<div class="content">I think if there ever was an idea worth of patenting, Autofocus is it. I mean, it's orders of magnitude more complex than these "a method to track customer purchases to generate recommendations" software patent crap corporations use to sue the hell out of each other.<br><br>Yes, I realize that point of view doesn't improve my case. :-)<br><br>I sent an email to Mark right after my last post. Now I can only wait. Even if I'm not technically infringing, which I doubt, it would be poor repayment for what Mark has given us all to go against his wishes. He wants it down, it goes down. Of course it would also be cool if he liked it and we could make it official.</div>

<div class="content">There are a few things to be distinguished. Copyright is different from patents. And U.S. law is different from EU/UK/German law(s). And all of them are quite different from what software corporations, the RIAA, the MPAA et al. want to make people believe. What's in question here is European copyright law(s). The "track customer purchases to generate recommendations" stuff is U.S. patent law, which is not applicable in Europe.</div>

<div class="content">Well I think it's brilliant stuff. I have my own solution in mindmanager but this is really neat.<br><br>All the trademark stuff...GTD has a million applications, I don't see how this is different. It only helps the idea spread. And I doubt if you can protect an idea like this. Why would you want to anyway. Ultimately just reinforces a scarcity mindset and it limits the distribution and success. <br><br>Some are against commercializing AF and others feel it should be protected. I think even copyrighting the instructions will inhibit it's potential. Doesn't it ultimately stem from the belief that others can take something away from you? By the same token you might be able to justify MF to pay royalties to all the thinkers he's studied that built on his knowledge that lead to his particular insights. Silly obviously...<br>just my 2cts</div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter<br><br>Would be interested to know how you have worked your Mindmanager version.  I still use OneNote for AF which works brilliantly for me but use Mindmanager in my project planning.  Can you elaborate a bit on that......  perhaps another post?<br></div>
<h2>Reply by Liz I.</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-18 4:39</div>
<div class="content">Peter, I agree that it's great when others are inspired by an idea and use it, extend it, etc.<br><br> I just think--and again, this comes from my own personal perspective--that taking the Autofocus system and extending/changing it to a web based system AND calling it "Autofocus" is an infringement. If someone came up with an an app named "Focus-Pocus" and publicized or marketed it as "a way to implement Autofocus" I'd probably think that's OK. "Things," for example, is a way to implement GTD but it isn't marketed as GettingThingsDone.com. <br><br>But, and again, speaking for myself, if I were the creator/maker of Autofocus, I'd expect to be asked for permission before someone put out an application branded as "autofocus.cc".</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-18 8:47</div>
<div class="content">Liz:<br><br>As I said before, I understand your point of view and agree that it was rude and thoughtless of me not to check with Mark first.<br><br>That being said, I feel the need to point out that there are dozens of free unofficial GTD apps that are branded with the GTD: <a href="http://trgtd.com.au/," rel="nofollow">http://trgtd.com.au/,</a> <a href="http://monkeygtd.blogspot.com/," rel="nofollow">http://monkeygtd.blogspot.com/,</a> <a href="http://www.simplegtd.com/," rel="nofollow">http://www.simplegtd.com/,</a> <a href="http://www.gtdagenda," rel="nofollow">http://www.gtdagenda,</a> GTDTiddlyWiki, iGTD, GTDInbox etc. etc.<br><br>Of course, I'm only defensive because I feel pretty bad about this by now. <br><br>When I searched for domains to use for this, I was surprised to finde autofoucs.cc available and it seemed to good to pass up. I figured it would work like "autofocus.cc implements Autofocus Tme Management System". I even thought it might be nice to take the "cc" in the name literal and to make it open source under Creative Commons license. That of course is a step I definitely won't do without Marks permission.</div>

<div class="content">@Liz: You make a good point obviously. I think if Andreas was a corporation or business that came out with a primary intent of making money of a profitable idea, or a business model from the get go, I'd be thinking along those lines as well. <br><br>On a side note, autofocus is probably a standard term in the photography, isn't it? I'd reckon it's hard to protect a term like that even if one would want to.<br><br>@Christine:<br>When I started using Onenote (adore that program) I used it for task management, but then when I discovered mindmanager I realized that was even more flexible. My setup in mindmanager is fairly easy but requires some add-ons to Mindmanager to work best. I'm still tweaking it but will share it for other mindmappers when I've ironed it out. The beauty of it is that you can switch seemlesly between Project Management mode or AF mode...or even GTD mode. <br>For now I could send you a screenshot will give you an idea if you like? Just point me to an email address:)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">It was not my intention to criticize Andreas, who handled this issue in a fairly decent way and already expressed his willingness to change the name of the service or event take it down completely (the latter would be a pity IMO). <br><br>But I stand by my advice to Mark to seek legal counseling (by someone specialized in intellectual property law).</div>

I'm not sure if it is good if it possible to edit tasks, it makes it possible to "cheat" in a way you can't in the paper based version. I see the point of rephrasing tasks on re-adding them, but perhaps that will be unnecessary once there is a "quick add" box at the top/bottom of each page. So you could just mark a task as done and rephrase it in the quick add box.<br><br>I'll see what I can do.</div>

<div class="content">Well done with the app, Andreas.<br><br>I had a think about the data structure for this a few weeks ago, regarding tasks which can be done in more than one location. Have you built in the facility to select multiple locations? The consequence in structure was that the line number had to be stored in each instance, to track whether the creation of a new page for that location was triggered.<br><br>There is also the issue of whether, if a cloning technique be used, to adjust all the other clones when one of them is ticked and perhaps copied to the end of the last list.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Java sounds great!  That would make it work on all major OSes, too.<br><br>Ever heard of BubbleTimer (www.bubbletimer.com)?  It's basically a very simple and stylish yet quite useful time tracking app (web based).  Anyways, what I was thinking is that in terms of UI design their concept might lend itself very well to AF.  The key components are simplicity and beauty.  While beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder and we could probably discuss simplicity from different angles, I in using BT have found them striking a great balance.  So I thought you might want to have a look at it and maybe get inspired.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi<br>This is my THIRD attempt at autofocus.  I signed up for the web app.  Within a minute I hit a stumbling block.  When I list a batching item, i.e. answer mail or want a "batch" type project task list, how do I create such a list? The web app is guided by number of items per page.  I don't see how to go to (or create) a subsequent page that's actually a batch of related tasks. My prime batch pages are my preplanned weekly check sheets and my daily checksheets.  I'd like to keep the entire system together, not separate.<br>Am I missing something, or am I expected to keep batch lists separate......yet another thing to keep track of .  If I'm going to keep trying to give autofocus a proper go, I don't want to quit simply because I don't understand a procedure.<br>How do other "planners" work this out both in general usage and using this web app?<br>(Three strikes: I'll be out....I'd really like to make it work simply because so many people are so enamoured over autofocus.  I must either be missing something or it simply doesn't fit my thinking and doing style.  Fingers crossed!)<br>learning as I go<br></div>

Perhaps you should open a thread to discuss this with Mark and others who can perhaps help you with this, I'm not sure I can. Autofocus does follow a less structured approach, that is its strenght. I could be possible that it's just not compatible with your thinking structures / world view, I don't think there is "one system to rule them all". Everyone is different.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br>Thank you for your reply.  I'm beginning to understand better.  Although I do plan my aims for the dday, week, etc, I also leave myself plenty of flex time.  Because I'm creative and extemporaneous........and disabled, I need flex time to allow for the unexpected aspects of the day to present themselves.  (Usually, these times are the best aspects as well!.....but, that doesn't involve referring to a list over and over to decide what to do.  Somehow I think I'm just not "getting" some aspect of it.........Maybe, your advice is golden...maybe my brain is hardwired differently.....(although I seem to intuit that somewhere between my planning and improvising tendencies......I might see where autofocus might fit.

<div class="content">learning as I go:<br><br>I wish you all the best with your autofocus trial. I think it's good that you don't want to give up on it too fast, but don't feel bad if you're struggling. Every system has aspects that make it more or less attractive to certain personality types. There are people who thrive on GTD, but I never got the hang of that. From what you wrote before it seems to me that you're getting good results with DIT, is that correct? If your current system is working, you don't have to get autofocus, but of course trying it can be an interesting experience that gives you one or two new impulses.<br><br>I'm actually currently bedridden. I had an accident several weeks ago in which I fractured my spine. Fortunately, there my spinal cord wasn't damaged, so I will be okay. But I have to lie about for quite some time, which left me somewhat depressed. Even before my accident I had procrastinated a lot, but lying in bed all day I stop doing pretty much anything and things began to pile up. Then I read about autofocus and decided to try it. Since then I unstuck many things that had weighed me down for months. I still have to lie in bed (I can use a notebook computer, that's how I developed the app), but now I have a sense of control over my life that I haven't had in a long time. I feel actually good. It's hard to describe. So for me, autofocus just works, it was just what I needed.</div>

Barack Obama is championing some aspects of stem cell research....so there's hope for me as well!  Also.........pain is pain......sometimes our attitudes and bravery are cyclic.  Sometimes when I allow myself to privately cry and yell and curse my fate, it somehow washes it away and is replaced by new determination to keep on rolling!  It has taken me a lot of years to realize that it's OK to flush out the negativity that builds up inside of me....it's NOT a loss of my self-respect (so long as there are no witnesses!  LOL!).  In fact, I think of it as natural to care about myself enough to feel sympathy and resesntment about it all.  That same caring also provides me with the fortitude to work like hell to preserve my hopes, gratitudes and determination to uphold the best quality of life I can muster up for myself.......Just don't get too comfortable with giving in to the pain, lonliness, boredom and bleak outlook.........Get stubborn and fight against it like you're covering your own back in a brawl!

<div class="content">It would be also nice to have way to go through the pages even when "cheating mode" is turned off... but in this case you can only read items on other pages, not mark them as done...just instead of text "To move on, do one task or dismiss all on this page." there could be a text "you can't marked tasks as done now cause active page is page number X" :)<br><br>One of rules is "DO use common sense.
