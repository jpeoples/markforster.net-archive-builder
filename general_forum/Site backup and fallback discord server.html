<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br><br>since there have been concerns regarding Mark's whereabouts and well-being and the future of this site, I have created a backup copy of the whole site and uploaded it to archive.org.<br><br>It can be found here: <a href="http://archive.org/details/markforster.squarespace.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://archive.org/details/markforster.squarespace.com</a><br><br>It's a zip archive that's 447 mb compressed and 2.2 gb uncompressed. After unpacking it, you can open any of the html files (index.html is the start page) and browse the site locally on your computer. All forum posts and articles are preserved.<br><br>The current state of the site backup is from March 7th, 2025. I will occasionally update the backup to include newer forum posts.<br><br>Also, as Nico suggested in the thread "Mark update? Site is slow?", I also created a Discord server that could serve as a fallback to meet up if this site ever goes offline. I'm not convinced Discord is a  good match for the kind of discussions that take place here, but it's something.<br><br>Here is the invite link to the Discord server: https://discord.gg/4vm8CtHY<br><br>Hopefully both measures will not be needed for a long time, and if Mark or anyone else objects, I will take them both down again.<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>

<div class="content">Thank you so much!  I have been thinking I would come to the site one day and it would be gone (which would be a very dark day).  You are truly the best.</div>

<div class="content">I created a new backup with the state of the site on March 16th. I currently can't update the file on archive.org for some reason. (It says "Item not available" when I click on "edit".)<br><br>I'll see if I can figure it out. It is rather inconvenient to upload and download that big archive file every time something changed anyway. I'll look into options to preserve the content in smaller self-contained chunks.</div>

<div class="content">Can you post another Discord invite, maybe a permanent one? Or the name of the server so we can search for it? I'd like to join. I use the same name there as here: Cricket .</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for the archive & discord! I don't post often, but Mark's systems & the discussions around them have greatly influenced my thinking around time management & I would hate to lose this community</div>

<div class="content">Wow; thank you to those who've set this up and created the backup.  I'm not a very active poster; but I also have really appreciated this group and would be sad to loose it.  I've also joined the Discord.</div>
