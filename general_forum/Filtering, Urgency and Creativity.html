<div class="content">I'm continuing to use DWM (electronic implementation) as I need to work from a single list with the facility to filter instantly. Due to fixed page lengths I cannot think of a way SAF can accommodate this.<br><br>Also the question of deciding what is urgent is a moot point - some things which seem urgent at the time are not, and can divert us.<br><br>Perhaps SAF works well for quantitative productivity in a commercial setting, but is less geared to creativity. Would it work for writing War and Peace?<br><br>Having said this, I have thought of adding the equivalent of column 2 to DWM (highlighted tasks which must be acted on rather than passed by), but prefer not to thus far, being concerned they would interrupt my flow, and weaken my intuition (which, growing accustomed to being ignored, might ignore me in turn).<br><br>Has anyone successfully introduced a column 2 to DWM, or made filtering work in an electronic use of SAF?  Are SAF users still being sensitive to what "stands out" as in the original AF and DWM?<br><br>Maybe DWM was considered too awkward for paper users, but for those of us using it with software (just me?), I would be interested in any tweaks which have been found which similarly help urgent things (whatever that means!) get done a little faster without interfering too much with the flow of the system  (I am using the original DWM based on calendar dates.)</div>

<div class="content">Come to think of it, I can add filtering to SAF by using an outline and branch structure, a "Column 2" branch within main branches Page 1, Page 2, Page 3 . . . so I could give it a trial run . . .still unsure how to define urgent, but maybe that becomes clear in practice.<br><br>Would I lose the stable list length which DWM has given me for the past year? Is it too soon for people to judge if the lists are growing faster than the tasks are being done?</div>

<div class="content">DWM *introduced* the concept of unfinished work as separate from new work.  The subsequent systems merely built on the idea.  The first difference between SF and DWM is the former has a visual separation of new vs. unfinished.  So as I posted earlier, follow DWM but digitally flag the re-entered stuff AS Unfinished in addition to putting it on today +7.  That is your virtual column 2.<br><br>If you want to be closer to SAF which insists you keep working at stuff you start, re-enter  everything at day +1.  Add urgent stuff to day+0.</div>

<div class="content">I bet you could try something like this:<br>Work DWM pages one week at a time.<br>Follow the DWM dismissal rule.<br>Treat each week like a page for active tasks, and follow SF rules for rewriting.<br>Hard limit of 4 active tasks.<br><br>As for SF:<br>Filtering... I'm not sure what manner of filtering you did.  SF normally insists you stick to a page, then stick to the next page.  There's not much call for filtering.  When something comes up, <br><br>I do use Search to find something I need.  You are allowed to use urgency as a reason to do something now/soon, rather than when you get to it in the list.<br><br>"Stands out" still applies.<br><br>An outline structure with drag/drop should work, except for dismissing.  The tricky thing about digital SF is that deleting or moving tasks (not by crossing out) screws up the "start next page when full" and "dismiss when full" rules.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Alan for ideas and suggestions.<br><br>I'm giving SAF a trial run with an outline structure at the moment, and yes I do have to take care with the number of items (i.e. not deleting).<br><br>Will see how it goes. I have just finished a session on a project to be completed within the next few weeks, and have to decide whether to move it (i.e. copy, strike through, and paste the copy) to column 2 or column 1, and which page . . .  I am assuming column 2 of the next page.<br><br>My DWM file has transferred to three Pages (31 one items each as per Mark's photo), I have my Studio filter on, and will see how it works out - I should easily be able to go back to DWM if need be, and maybe try out your suggestions in it.<br><br>PS Reason I like filtering is that several tasks have multiple contexts for me, and I prefer to flag these rather than have separate files. Your ideas for adaptation to DWM look good though I don't understand the limit for active tasks yet . . . I am sure that will become clear.</div>

<div class="content">SF has a soft limit for active tasks: too many and your page fills up and inactive tasks will be dismissed. I assume therefore that limiting is desirable and that's why I suggested it.</div>

<div class="content">It's been an interesting experiment, but after a day with SAF I miss the flexibility and simplicity of DWM and have transferred back to it. <br><br>@Alan - Interesting there is the soft limit of active tasks, I guess this corresponds to the small number of tasks that drop off my DWM file as often as not in my morning routine. Thanks for your attention on this and at least I understand better now what people have been posting about.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Anything you come up with is worth a practical test, for me. That's how I came to appreciate and adopt DWM, after initial doubts. In this case, with my electronic usage of filtering, I found the added complexity of SAF outweighed any benefits over DWM. (In addition to reservations I have over how the role of intuition is affected.)<br><br>You haven't experienced using DWM with software and instant filtering, but I would urge you to try it some time (Artist's Manifesto II. Embrace technology). Though I have to say that what I am doing was technically difficult to set up and is not for everyone (I have spent a portion of my life designing databases).<br><br>I have no doubt that for paper users SAF is often better, and my implementation with ListPro has been refining and improving over the year. I am hoping to keep this going when I switch from Windows Mobile to iPhone in the near future.<br><br>I use only one list and filter by place and context, which does not transfer easily to SAF.<br><br>So my perception is that I tried it, and found that you had made it more complicated. Of course I realise that for paper users the reverse might be true.<br><br>I am assuming that your perception is that adding filtering makes the system more complicated, but to me it's like adding an engine to a horse and carriage.<br><br>For me, your initial DWM (adapted with electronic filtering), is your masterpiece so far. I eagerly consider every new system you come out with for new ideas that can inform and change my practice.</div>

<div class="content">"In this case, with my electronic usage of filtering, I found the added complexity of SAF outweighed any benefits over DWM. "<br><br>SuperFocus is not complex.  Electronic filtering made things complex.  It's a trick that suits DWM but is bad for SuperFocus.  What you tried was broken, and you haven't yet experienced the potential benefits.</div>

<div class="content">I also had found DWM to be well-suited for Microsoft Outlook, and used it that way for quite a long time.   I also used Outlook categories to filter tasks (home vs work, as well as filtering on various projects, team meetings, etc.).  It worked very well.<br><br>One thing I REALLY liked was the ability to flag an email and instantly turn that email into a task.  One click, and one drag to file the email away, and I'm all set.  The email shows up as a task in my DWM list.  If I want, I can also add a category to make sure it only shows up on my work list (for example).   This was much faster and more convenient than trying to track the task in my notebook.<br><br>I've tinkered with something similar yesterday and today in Outlook for SAF.  I like the notebook-based SAF very much, but still miss some of the features you can get on the computer.  If the tinkering results in anything useful I will let you know.  So far it looks promising.</div>

<div class="content">@Seraphim - It is hard to find the right electronic solution. I also thought about trying Outlook with SAF, but then realised it would not integrate well with my PDA. But please keep me posted, I'm interested in anything that keeps me on track. I'm also moving from Windows Mobile to iPhone soon, so will probably keep using ListPro which probably transfers well.<br><br>I agree, integration with email is great (I think Todoist does something similar with gmail). It's so convenient to paste an email into a task note. I am hoping such things will become easier on the move with an iPhone.<br><br>@Alan - I'd love to experience the benefits of SAF. Show me the way! But I require filtering.</div>

<div class="content">One version of "filtering" might be to simply have two (or more) notebooks or lists. I follow Mark's suggestion to have one for work and one for home (and I don't worry if they overlap a bit).<br><br>Also, I still use OmniFocus on my iPhone and computer, for outlining bigger projects (with all the tags and filters available), and keep a recurring task on the paper list to "check OmniFocus).</div>

<div class="content">There is a thread on how to implement SAF on the iphone :"superfocus electronic implementations?"<br>There is no ideal solution for SAF at the moment though.<br>The best solution is a spreadsheet software.<br>For lists or task management without SAF Omnifocus is very good.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-02-16 15:22</div>
<div class="content">The problem is trying to do too many things at once:<br>1) Learn and get used to SuperFocus<br>2) Come up with a usable electronic implementation<br>3) Alter the rules and dynamic of SuperFocus by adding filters<br><br>Concurrently doing the first two is tricky already.  After I have a grasp of those, I can think about ways to adapt the system.  Right now it's beyond me.  <br><br>So Laurence, if filtering is that essential I suggest you wait until someone presents a rock-solid easy implementation of SuperFocus so you only have to figure 1 and 3 simultaneously.</div>

<div class="content">I like OF very much It is for me one of the best tools for tasking. BUT after many tries and many wash out the best tool i ever found is ....<br>A pen and a paper A5 note book I scan regularly. <br><br>I also use "a weekly or fortnightly goals list (called 'projects list' in GTD), and a someday list (same in GTD)". <br><br>I also use a calendar which is ical because of my iphone. <br><br>Now i don't need anything else. I could get rid of any other paper folders.</div>

Especially for the horse.<br><br>:o)<br><br>I am strangely drawn to the idea of filtering by context, but in practice most of my work is within range of a laptop so I would probably not use it myself. Until I can get an Outlook task lookalike synced to Exchange on my Palm Pre, anyway. (Pocket Informant, where are you when I need you?)<br><br>No, this is weakness: I don't have a need that justifies adding another second or two to each task entry. YMMV.</div>

<div class="content">I've been thinking about this.  For me, the main reason I want an electronic implementation is so I can make emails into tasks with one click.  <br><br>So many emails are one-off tasks that need to be done, but can't be done right now.   I've never been able to figure out a good way to keep those emails flagged or highlighted in some way, and to keep a corresponding task in my AF/SF notebook that tells me to process that email.  The best I've been able to do is throw the emails into a "Later" folder, and then keep a recurring task on my paper list to process that folder.   But then, things get hung up in that folder.<br><br>It worked well with DWM, because I could apply DWM rules to the "Later" folder.  Whenever I needed to make an email into a task, I would flag it and set the due-date to today+30 with a one-click macro, and put it in the folder.   When I process the folder, all the emails there are already sorted in DWM order and I can process using DWM rules.  <br><br>When I first converted over to SFv3, I still kept using my DWM folders for email-based tasks.  And that worked OK.  But SF is so much more effective for me than DWM, that I'd like to find a way to convert all my Outlook tasks to SF. <br><br>Does anyone have any other ideas for handling emails that require action?  whether one-off or project-related?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">"Send to OneNote" from Outlook. Well since I'm working from OneNote this is a two click solution.  <br><br>If you have a paper notebook, I'd create an outlook folder for those tasks you need to work on, and write the task in the notebook "Jim - report (Outlook)".  Look it up, and delete it/archive it when done.  You should never have more than a page full of emails you're working on.</div>

<div class="content">@Will - It does take marginally longer to enter the tasks (for me a single click per context), but on the other hand you save time when scanning down a list as you don't have to assess tasks which are out of context. Presumably you are using your laptop in different contexts/places so maybe filtering would help you?</div>

<div class="content">I think I will stay with DWM until I get my iPhone, when I will be able to give SAF a fairer try (having some new tools available), but I have come up with a way of adding a SAF feature to DWM and am going to try it out.<br><br>The strong dismissal in DWM means that my biggest filtered list is under sixty items (and usually less), so I will be treating each filtered list as a single page. I have added a flag to mark Column 2/urgent items. I'm highlighting them all red (as I also do for those about to be dismissed today).<br><br>I'll be watching to see if the list starts to grow again, a life-long issue that DWM solved for me.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence, what do you mean by "single list with the facility to filter instantly"?<br><br>Do you mean MSExcel like "autofilter", where you select from a dropdown list of keywords for a particular field, and then it'll show only tasks with fields matching the keyword?<br><br>If yes, then Toodledo.com filtering on "tags" and "context" fields might be sufficient for you. A few of us who were using DWM on Toodledo have moved to using SFv3 on the same.
