<div class="content">I work in a corporate environment where tasks are mostly not self-generated but are often linked to organisational priorities and come down the chain of command.  Many of these are not repetitive but still have deadlines.  I need to keep track of these - do piece of work no. 1 by [date 1], piece of work no. 2 by [date 2] etc.  At any one time I may have 50 such items.<br><br>I'm not sure how to best use the autofocus approach but still keep an eye on the deadlines (which may be scattered across several pages of the masterlist).  I certainly don't want to have to maintain multiple lists.  Applying the commonsense rule would suggest that you write the deadlines along with the task description.  However, you would need to then keep an eye on the total list not just a page by page approach.<br><br>Some other musings:<br>Is there a risk that writing out one long list of every outstanding task may have a self-defeating outcome with people feeling overwhelmed by the work to be done?<br><br>The idea of working on what "stands out" is interesting and reminds me of David Allen's GTD model for choosing what actions to do now.  One of his criteria was energy available, along with context, time available etc.  At the time he was criticised for ignoring the then orthodoxy of focusing on what is urgent and important.<br><br>I think Mark's observations about balancing the rational and impulsive are very insightful.<br><br>Best wishes<br><br>Jack</div>

<div class="content">Jack:<br><br>I don't work in a corporate environment myself, but I do have deadlines. I've found that the method you have suggested of writing the deadline in with the task works well when it's really needed - but the important thing is not to get too obsessed with writing in deadlines. Just do it where you feel it's necessary. This is intended to be a free-flowing intuitive system and putting too much detail can get in the way and turn it into yet another "head job".<br><br>If the system is working properly you should find that you are cycling through the entire list several times a day. I find that is quite sufficient for keeping the whole list in my mind.</div>
