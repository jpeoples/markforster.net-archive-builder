<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-12-5 8:17</div>
<div class="content">I went through old discussions here and found several discussing how many tasks users currently have in their AF systems. I just wonder whether there is any number of tasks which AF/DWM systems naturally reach and then tend to balance around when using long-term (without backlogs or not when just starting the system). Or whether it is individual/situationally based. What do you think, what do you witness?<br><br>I usually have around 140-160 active tasks and this number does not fluctuate considerably (I use superfocus). What is your experience?</div>

<div class="content">I'm using an AF1-like variation of SF (meaning I use Column 2 only for urgent tasks). My number of open tasks most of the time is between 60 and 70 (this morning 69 spread over 9 open pages).<br><br>I've given some more statistics in this thread:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1630099" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1630099</a></div>

<div class="content">My current list is 43 active tasks over 3 open SF pages.  Average seems to be between 40 and 55 tasks.  Oldest open page started on 29th November (last Tuesday).<br><br>I also have someday/maybe/not right now lists for 3 areas, which capture stuff I know I'm going to have to do eventually but they aren't currently active.  Some of the items on them are stuff which has been dismissed from the active list and relegated to a backlog.<br><br>Work: 5 tasks waiting (these are subject to various project managers competing to schedule them via my line manager)<br>Business: 6 tasks waiting (these are 'in my own time' items which need dedicated chunks of a weekend (stuff like prototyping a new website layout etc)<br>Home: 59 tasks waiting (big issues with running out of weekend before I run out of home stuff to do!)</div>

<div class="content">I use SF, without distinguishing between home and work ... currently I have 5 pages open in my free-form book; my pages are 35 lines long.<br>Page 14 - opened 19/11; 6 open<br>Page 18 -  opened 21/11; 6 open<br>Page 22 - opened 27/11; 3 open<br>Page 25 - opened 28/11; 6 open<br>Page 26 - opened 30/11; 21 open<br>Page 27 - opened 2/12; 20 open & 3 closed in C1; 4 open in C2<br><br>So that's... 66 open.

<div class="content">I have about 50 to 60 open tasks. I use AF1 which I most like with AF4. <br><br>SF is great but complicated for me. I fell less comfortable with it. <br><br>I like the way AF1 let me reformulate things and report my tasks. I control urgent thing by putting a * in front of each urgent things AND TRICKING MY FIRST PASS buy dropping all what is not with a *.  for the unfinished things it is easy they are alway at the end. <br><br>I do it on paper because it gives me a best control and a real feeling about my stuff.<br><br>I also use a paper mate pencil and an erase il lets me recycle pages.</div>

<div class="content">3 tasks. One of which is batched and recurres most days: 'Clear Inboxes & red tasks'. I usually have around 10-15 daily inbox tasks to update and 'red tasks' (approx 5-10 small items) are held in Outlook tasks and have reached their due date - great for tasks that require reviewing. The other 2 daily slots are for doing bigger tasks / parts of projects.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-12-5 16:26</div>
<div class="content">In my AF1-like, project-oriented monstrosity that lives in OneNote, I have:<br><br>- About 50 active recurring tasks (many recur several times per day such as checking and clearing email; others approximately daily such as checking how my son's broken nose from his bicycle accident is healing; others recur approximately weekly such as watering the trees)<br><br>- About 35 active projects each consisting of 5 to 30 tasks<br><br>- About 200 random one-off tasks (misc emails to respond to, articles to read, one-off phone calls, actions or requests, and the like).  A lot of this seems important or interesting at first -- and before finding Mark Forster, I probably would have just started reading it or acting on it immediately.  Now it goes into the list and percolates.  Some of the items turn out to be project-related so they get moved to a project page.  And many of the one-off items are actually important, and they usually get done pretty quickly.  But the rest sits there for a few cycles, perhaps serving as an interesting mental break -- an article with some nice insight into epistemology for example, which has no practical value that I can really see but is always interesting to me.  But probably 80% of those leftover items are eventually dismissed.<br><br>Right now it's all personal stuff since I'm on vacation.   My personal stuff tends to be about three times as much as my work stuff.   Which is kinda backwards since when I'm working, I have about 5 times as much time for work as I do for personal stuff.   Which is probably why I always feel on top of my work but my personal / family projects are always a mess.</div>

<div class="content">For me the main finding from this poll is that the number of tasks in someone's system is a pretty meaningless figure. Different people have different ways of entering tasks, ranging from Leon's three tasks to Seraphim's 400 or so. Yet is Seraphim any busier or more productive than Leon or vice versa? It's impossible to tell from these figures.<br><br>Is there a better measure? <br><br>I suggested a while back that the number of days' work remaining in the system was a useful measure. <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/9/25/speed-update-day-2.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/9/25/speed-update-day-2.html</a><br><br>Another measure is is how long it takes for all the tasks entered on a given day to be actioned.<br><br>Neither of these is perfect by any means. <br><br>Maybe the most important measure would be a subjective one - how far you feel that everything is getting done when it should be done.<br><br>If you were to mark yourself out of 10 for this, what would you score? (10 = everything getting done when it should be done; 0 = nothing getting done when it should be done).</div>

<div class="content">Subjectively, I tend to feel more satisfied completing my 3 tasks for the day - and then taking it easy! This is in contrast with me constantly feeling behind with a long list of tasks (not just AF but any system). <br><br>Would a useful question be 'How satisifed do I feel with what I have done today'? (0 = Unsatisfied, 10 = Most satisfied)</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>If you ask a silly question, you get a silly answer.<br><br>We've had all this out before. Tasks don't need to be finished. It's a measure of how much work it will take to clear all the entries currently in the system. It's particularly useful for tracking the trend of how well you are keeping up with the tasks you are adding to the list. If your Work Remaining in the System keeps increasing, then you are falling behind.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-12-6 19:30</div>
<div class="content">For me, these answers are interesting - of course, the total number of active tasks will depend on many factors - if general or smaller tasks are defined, how much routines/daily chores/only outstanding tasks are involved, on personal style and preferences etc. But it seems to me that majority of people have their "standard" number around which they move without great fluctuation, lets say +- 20%, but definitely not +-50%. Or, at least nobody here indicated otherwise. And that was basically what I intended to ask about. My idea was, that as each of us needs different stress level, or different level of tidiness or different level of spontaneity/rules to feel optimally, maybe we tend to have the same level of various tasks defined in front of us...</div>

<div class="content">Mark: as for the "objective" measures of productivity, I doubt that we can define it by task characteristics. Number of days needed to start the tasks defined today or to close the list started on certain day will be again influenced by factors like how general/detailed tasks you define, how many tasks you have or personality style (longer time with one task/shorter with many tasks...).<br><br> Even your suggested "subjective" scale "10 - everything getting done when it should be done; 0 = nothing getting done when it should be done" would not be valid for me, because I as a typical perfectionist tend to underestimate time needed for doing tasks for whole my life and even if I finish many tasks I somehow feel "they could have been done earlier/quicker".<br><br>But if I should simply evaluate (on 1-10) how I perceive myself to be productive using AF comparing with other systems which I tried, I would vote near to ten.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: "I suggested a while back that the number of days work remaining in the system was a useful measure."<br><br>Even though the topic has been discussed before, I'm finding it difficult to master the notion.  It's not as self-evident as you think.  Thinking this through now, I think I can make sense of this in the fashion you laid out before:<br><br>I have 100 tasks.  Today I act on 20 of those 100, and add 30 on the end.<br>Tomorrow I act on 25 of those 110 (but 10 of the original 90), and add 15 on the end.  I'm back at 100, but 80 of the original set.  So the workload seems to be stable, and I seem to have 10 days work at hand - meaning stuff can get behind up to 10 days given this pace.<br><br>Which is more than I'd like, so I should think to reduce my workload somehow.<br><br>My new thinking for today.</div>

<div class="content">In fact, it's the minimum time if you ignored new items, kept up the average work rate, and worked each item on that list only one time - not doing something repeatedly over several days.  This metric may function okay as a quick indicator of workload.  <br><br>Because it doesn't reflect actual working habits, (new tasks, recurring tasks, tasks worked in multiple chunks) the number of days computed will not in any way match actual days spent.</div>

<div class="content">Just to throw in another dimension of measures into the discussion: I'm tracking not only the number of open pages and tasks in my SF3 system but also the age of the oldest unactioned task. These three figures (or actually the two sets of three figures - one for work one for home tasks) give me an good indication how I'm getting along:<br>* if the number of open tasks is getting higher than usual, I'm getting hesitant to take new commitments<br>* if the numer of open pages gets to high (esp. the ratio of pages to tasks), I'm trying to speed up the "circulation"<br>* if the oldest tasks are older than a month, I try to "kill" them one or the other way next time I'm on the respective page<br>Regards and have a nice "4. Advent"</div>
