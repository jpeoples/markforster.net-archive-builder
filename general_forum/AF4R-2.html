<div class="content">Hi !<br><br>Merry Christmas to you !!!<br><br>The forum is quiet for the moment may be because it's christmas time ;-) or you found the ideal system already :) LOL <br><br>For myself I thought about my experiences with AF this past year and I fount it very interesting<br><br>I have a few need <br>- Followings Old tasks<br>- Entering new Tasks<br>- Following what is on the flow (REMAINING)<br>- Following my RECURRING<br>- Following my URGENCIES<br>- Dont let groth the list too much because I wont be able to do things and take altitude. <br><br>I tried some AF methods AF, 1 - 2, 4, SF, AF4R, DIT, DWM<br><br>I tried reporting the past night all daily tasks and ideas and then extracting some tasks in the morning for the next day and work on it . <br><br>This is my summary experiments.<br>So, <br><br>I began with AF. <br>+ :  I found it great for following my stuff doing things and intuition<br>- : I found it was difficult to deal with urgencies even with AF2 because some urgencies were somewhere on the list and not often at the end off it. <br><br>SF : <br>+ : Fantastic for old and new tasks + Urgencies<br>- : Problem with recurring and remaining tasks<br><br>AF4R : <br>+ : Great for knowing at a glance old new task, remaining, recurring <br>- : Same as AF difficulties with urgencies. <br><br>My proposal : AF4R2<br>AF4R with NEW/OLD - RECURRING - UNFINISHED + Add a new one  URGENT <br><br>How ? If something is urgent just report on URGENT and put this page at the beginning of your binder. <br><br>It's just a thought I didn't try it... But I gonna try....<br><br>Mark any ideas ?</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Merry Christmas to you too, Jupiter!<br><br>I am actually trialing a version of AF4 + 3TS that incorporates almost all that I have learned over the past year in various versions and tweaks of DWM and AF, and so far it achieves ALL of your requirements...and then some! ^___^<br><br> In summary, it has<br><br>1) AF4R's distinction of new/old, recurring, and unfinished tasks, but instead of putting them in distinct columns like AF4R, I am keeping them in the list with different symbols like in my practice in DWM2: <br><br>> New task<br>o Finished recurrent task<br>● Unfinished task<br><br>2) Tweaked 3TS as I detailed here: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1346124#item1346300" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1346124#item1346300</a><br><br>3) Maintenance checklists: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1253799" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1253799</a><br><br>4) Project files as described by Alan: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1319077" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1319077</a><br><br>5) The "Filtering/Pre-Filtering" AF4 tweak: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814#item1265058" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814#item1265058</a><br><br>6) How I process the open and closed lists is now as Mark detailed it in AF4R: work on the closed list until you are done for now, then process the open list until you are done, then rinse; at least one task (hopefully more) must be done in the closed list upon transferring there, otherwise all remaining old tasks are dismissed.  This is to facilitate the processing of Unfinished Tasks.<br><br>The system so far has worked very well.  My observations:<br><br>1) It is fast, slim and nimble, yet can still accept and process anything you can throw at it because of the filtering/pre-filtering tweak.  It never bloats up with useless tasks, but always presents you with relatively few but relevant tasks.<br><br>2) Recurring tasks are either placed into maintenance checklists or placed on review by filtering/pre-filtering until they are needed to be done; the AF thus remains uncluttered.<br><br>3) The provision of one possible urgent task into the 3TS makes the whole system able to process urgent tasks very powerfully and flexibly (I have not properly tried SAF, but I would be surprised if it processes urgent tasks better).<br><br>4) The 3TS has exceeded the "separate piece of paper" tweak that I had trialed previously in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1305619#item1319853" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1305619#item1319853</a> in promise. It glues the whole thing together; it efficiently incorporates AF4, projects and checklists into one -almost- seamless system; re-writing is minimal.<br><br>5) The 3TS also achieves the "pull" effect described in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1335203" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1335203</a> : by drawing a line in between days of use of the 3TS paper, one can see the rough volume of work done in a day, and that is very fulfilling and motivating.<br><br>6) The whole system still processes unfinished tasks powerfully...more powerfully, in fact, than with my previous DWM2 version, which is quite a surprise.<br><br>I will try this system more before I post the more-or-less finalized instructions, but there should be enough details here for anyone to try making something like it or incorporate some of the ideas into his/her system.<br><br>God bless, Jupiter, and good luck with your tweak!  I'll try to help if I can.</div>

<div class="content">I'm sold nuntym!  I don't know your exact approach (not sure I need to either) but I'm jumping in: one list, with tags, processed like AF4R.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Alan: LOL! I wonder if the next AF will be DIY AF: assemble your own version of AF that will suit your needs.<br><br>Oh wait, that's what we all have been doing all this time, haven't we? ^___^<br><br>God bless!</div>
