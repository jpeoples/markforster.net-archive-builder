<div class="content">I can't comment on the original ASEM thread ( <a href="../blog/Another Simple and Effective Method.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html</a> ) so I'm creating one here.<br><br>Just noticed this new system and am intrigued enough to give it a try.<br><br>It's been a couple of weeks since the instructions were posted. I was just wondering if anyone had any comments on how it's working for them?</div>

<div class="content">Frank, <br>I was very interested in it and started testing right away. I like the immediacy and limited choices (after you've worked the list a bit) and the focus on the beginning of the list (older tasks). I had a hard time making short lists with FV (although I loved the idea in principle); ASEM has struck a chord for me. The bug was that some kinds of tasks, like recurring ones, or things I want to complete, were problematic. So when I read Alan's return to AF4R post (I had also liked AF4R) and Mark's comment re trying AF4R, using ASEM to work each list, I thought it was a great idea. It's early days, but, so far, it feels right for me; it's still simple and addresses recurring and unfinished things. <br><br>(Check out the post, <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html,</a> and you'll see that it didn't work for Mark.)</div>
