<div class="content">I'm still working on finding rules for SuperFocus which will get the balance between C1 and C2 exactly right.<br><br>My latest attempt is so far working extremely well:<br><br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>Current rules for SF (see SuperFocus Rules link in top menu), except:<br><br>Both urgent and unfinished tasks are entered on the page *after* the one you are currently working on.<br><br>When no further tasks stand out on a page, any remaining tasks in C2 are transferred to the next page.<br><br>There is only one occasion on which tasks are dismissed, which is when no tasks at all are done on visiting a page - in which case C1 tasks are dismissed and C2 tasks are transferred to the next page as above.<br><br>----------------------------------</div>

<div class="content">My main reasons for adopting these rules are:<br><br>1) Entering all C2 tasks on the next page avoids getting stuck on one page while a succession of urgent tasks are added.<br><br>2) The compulsory finishing of C2 tasks on a page tended to cause resistance, so C2 tasks may now be transferred to the next page.<br><br>3) The two above changes reduce the need for two different methods of dismissal, so this has been simplified so it is similar to the AF1 rule for dismissal.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, #2 also appears to help with the timing problem, where a task can go on snooze just briefly so that others can keep their momentum, or I can allow a C2 to be "not ready this minute" just because I feel it will be much more efficient, for various little reasons, if I wait a bit (such as, waiting until after so-and-so calls so I'll know I won't have to answer the phone).<br><br>Another effect of #2 is a continuum of priority levels. Tasks can be worked on every page turn or 2/3 of page turns, or every other page, etc. Not that one needs to count this out, but we will end up working each task at whatever priority/frequency we intuitively feel it deserves, without analysis.<br><br>Those two points were *exactly* my challenges with canonical SFv3, so I am thrilled to see this variation. It will be about a week before I can test it, as I will be spending most of that time in a tent, but I will dig in when I get back.<br><br>Thanks, Mark!</div>

<div class="meta">2011-05-2 14:25</div>
<div class="content">To make this point explicit:<br>When a C2 is full, we no longer dismiss that page just because it's full.  Wrapping around the list again, we attempt to enter things in the next C2, but because it's full we write on the following page instead.  Shortly after we turn to the full page.  C2 is both full and crossed out.  Therefore we must work one or more C1 tasks or dismiss the page.  It's likely we'll dismiss the page soon because (a) its tasks we've ignored for a while, and (b) we really want to get to the next page to get back on those C2's.  This is a good thing.<br><br>As a matter of habit, we don't want to be forwarding C2 tasks forever.  Forwarding a C2 task wouldn't count for the "when no tasks at all are done on visiting a page" rule, so you must do at least one C1 or C2 task each turn of the page.<br><br>Be flexible, and be focused on your goal: finishing the important tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, everyone, if this seems obtuse, but I just don't understand the idea of putting urgent tasks on the next page. This approach implies that there is an even-more-urgent task, which is to visit the next page.</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-05-2 18:19</div>
<div class="content">Visiting a page isn't considered a task.  Think like do-it-tomorrow, this is the "do it soon" rule.  <br><br>If you're consistent with SF, then nothing on the current page is urgent, except a C2 item.  If something new urgent comes up, and it's really urgent, you move forward to the next page quickly and do it.  The rule keeps you moving along at a steady pace.</div>

<div class="content">I can already tell that this latest iteration isn't going to work for me.  I need to be forced to engage with the C2 tasks and actually make decisions about them... even if that decision is demoting them back to C1 of the last page. Just carrying them forward lets me, in effect, ignore them. Yes, I suppose eventually C2 would fill and then I would be forced to deal with them but I have lots of resistance to the idea of letting it get that far.  I carried my C2 "laundry" task forward through every page of my list today and am just now (at 21:30) getting around to actually doing something about it.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-05-3 11:17</div>
<div class="content">Sarah:<br><br>Yes, I think I agree with you. I've ended up with a load of tasks in C2 which are not getting actioned much faster than they would have been if they were in C1.<br><br>I've already tried demoting unactioned C2 tasks back to C1 and that wasn't powerful enough to get them done reliably. "Parking" them on the page where they are also lacks power. On the other hand making it compulsory to do C2 tasks inevitably results in a rise in resistance.<br><br>What I've got to come up with is a rule for C2 which overcomes reluctance without raising resistance. Is that possible? Hmm . . .</div>

<div class="content">Mark, you say:<br><br>“When no further tasks stand out on a page, any remaining tasks in C2 are transferred to the next page.”<br><br>“2) The compulsory finishing of C2 tasks on a page tended to cause resistance, so C2 tasks may now be transferred to the next page.”<br><br><br>To the first statement:<br><br>Do you mean with this statement, you also work on C1 tasks before transferring the remaining (not touched) C2s to the next page?<br><br>If the rule “All C2s before any C1” is still valid, the moving of tasks to the next page without doing anything on them makes no sense – also on the next page you still have to do first all these C2s before any C1.<br><br>If the rule “All C2 before any C1” is not valid, then why shall I start with a C1 before finishing or at least working on the urgent C2s? (this brings us right to the so called “resistance topic”)<br><br>To 2:<br><br>This “working on all C2 before any C1” is a real “power factor” of Superfocus. Mainly because of this rule “things get done”.<br><br>The resistance you talk about is exactly what I also can confirm before attacking the last one or two remaining C2 tasks on a page. That’s only natural. We glance at the next page, we see several much “nicer” tasks, etc. These last remaining tasks on the actual page are not very welcomed. But now it’s decision time: face the enemy or run?<br><br>By following the Superfocus rules you face the enemy. And afterwards, even if there was done only a little bit to move these tasks ahead (take out the folder, work for 15 seconds on them, etc) the world looks much better! And things get done, and not only moved out of the way.<br><br>Mark, please don’t perform a dentist’s job at Superfocus and pull the teeth!  :-)<br>It is a really good system / tool. Improvement – yes, but not on the cost of performance!<br>But at the end of the day it's your decision ....<br><br>Greetings<br><br>Norbert</div>

<div class="content">What I'm thinking of is something on the following lines:<br><br>1) Urgent tasks on same page's C2, unfinished tasks on next page's C2.<br><br>2) When nothing further stands out on a page, all remaining C2 tasks are dismissed.<br><br>3) C1 tasks are only dismissed when nothing at all stands out on a page. (This is to prevent the dismissal rules becoming too complicated).<br><br>4) To clarify: the page remains active when C2 tasks are dismissed, but is made inactive when C1 tasks are dismissed.<br><br>This is the first time I've allowed the possibility of having dismissed tasks on an active page. Will it work? Let's see!</div>

<div class="content">Norbert:<br><br>"All C2 before C1" was a variation which was tested a while back. It was never incorporated in the official rules for SuperFocus (see the SuperFocus rules tab in the top menu). The problem with it was that it increased resistance to the point of avoiding working on the whole list. My aim at the moment is to find something that will still have bite, but will not increase resistance quite so much. <br><br>And of course you are at complete liberty to use any variation that suits you personally regardless of what the official rules say!</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-05-3 14:18</div>
<div class="content">I'm not sure if this is a tried variation, but here's my take:<br><br>1) Both urgent and unfinished tasks are entered on the page *after* the one you are currently working on.<br><br>2) When no further tasks stand out on a page, any remaining tasks in C2 are transferred to the last page C1.  (The founding post said next page)<br><br>3) There is only one occasion on which tasks are dismissed, which is when no tasks at all are done on visiting a page - in which case C1 tasks are dismissed and C2 tasks are transferred to the last page C1 (as above).</div>

<div class="content">Mark, <br>I was having pretty good success with the previous iteration. But if we've learned anything here it's that people are pretty idiosyncratic about these things.  ;^) And my "urgent" load is much smaller than many people's, and my list shorter.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I may have missed a variation or two along the way, but what problem arose for you with the "snooze" option plus automatic C1 demotion when you get to the last page?  I've been using that technique for a while now, and it works splendidly for me.  (I also never followed the  all-C2-before-C1 rule.)<br><br>What I find is that if I'm resisting finishing something, it fairly quickly gets snoozed forward a few pages, then demotes back to C1.  At the demotion point (i.e. before actually writing it in C1), I do a mini-review of this "resistant" task, and try to rephrase it so that picking it up again to continue will be easier or more tempting.<br><br>Hope you find your Holy Grail variation(s)!</div>

<div class="meta">2011-05-3 18:43</div>
<div class="content">ubi:<br><br>My problem with it was that I found the automatic demotion got in the way when I had tasks which I had had to "snooze" for perfectly legitimate reasons, e.g. time of day. Once they were back in C1 I found their impetus dissipated.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-05-3 22:15</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>So the snooze rule helps when context prevents you from otherwise clearing C2 of some unfinished task. But when that task gets "parked" back in C1 at the end of the list, you need a push to restart it. How about a "Restart" prefix on the task description, or some symbol such as a filled triangle (pointing right) to remind you that this was something you had wanted to finish, but got sidetracked due to circumstances?</div>

<div class="meta">2011-05-4 6:28</div>
<div class="content">For me, the best solution (or at least the one that has stuck) is:<br><br>- Standard SF rules, except the following.<br>- Enter urgent items in C1 on last page unless that makes me anxious that I won't get to it fast enough, in which case enter them on C2 of next page unless THAT makes me anxious, in which case enter them on C2 of current page.<br>- Clear C2 before starting C1.  This keeps a strong focus on completing the C2 items.<br>- I always retain the right to demote any C2 item back to C1 - re-enter in C1 of last page - when it just doesn't make sense to keep an item in C2 any more.  Maybe it will get re-promoted sometime.<br>- I also always retain the right to copy any C2 item forward to the next page if I want to keep giving it high attention but just can't take action on it right now for some reason.<br>- I try to apply the same rigor to the last two items that I would to re-instating a dismissed item -- i.e., there must be a very good reason why I am exercising my right to demote or to copy forward.<br><br>This gives me total control over C2 and allows me to use it just like I use the gear shift in my truck.  I can shift into high gear or shift back down to low gear.  Or I can park in the garage for a while.  :-)    <br><br>This seems to work as long as I always make sure I "have a good reason" for failing to take the required action on a C2 item.  <br><br>This flexible approach has worked great for me for over a month now.   But if Mark hits on a rule-based approach that he really feels satisfied with, I'd be happy to give it a try.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>What you are saying seems eminently sensible, and it obviously is working well for you which is great. But my aim is to find something in which I don't have to trust myself to "have a good reason" to do something. To go back to the swamp v. river analogy, which I think you found helpful, I want to get the banks right so that the river flows where I want it to simply by following its own nature.</div>

Hmm . . . >><br><br>This reminds me of Alan's thread on "Accumulating Resistance,"  where he proposed that the the ultimate solution to this quandary might be a system in which "the rules change (very slightly) from month to month according to the situation."  <br><br>I have found that novelty in and of itself helps to decrease resistance and overcome reluctance.  That's why it's fun (and usually productive) to try out these new variations.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I completely empathize with you.  I've written quite a bit about my own discomfort with "common sense overrides" and prefer a tighter heuristic that guides the working of the list.   And if anyone can find a heuristic that strikes the right balance between C2 compulsion and C2 freedom, it will be you.  :-)</div>
<h2>Reply by Seraphim</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-05-4 20:00</div>
<div class="content">Jeff N - The current rules already have built-in dynamics that are very much like slight rule modifications that automatically adjust to your situation.  <br><br>For example, simply cycling through the list produces this effect.  <br><br>The first time I start acting on a page, there are usually several items that are quick and easy to finish off.  Others are easy to start but need more work before completion.  And then there are others that just don't want to get started yet.  <br><br>On the second pass, the dynamic has changed: one or two of those items has now "ripened" and can be easily plucked.  Maybe one or two others have lost their relevance altogether and can be deleted.   The rest remain for the future.<br><br>With each pass, the dynamics change again, as the number of items on the page shrinks.  It is faster to process the page, and it becomes more clear which items really matter, which ones don't, and which ones do matter but are creating resistance for some reason.  <br><br>Finally the page is deleted or dismissed.   Dismissal introduces a whole new dynamic that triggers deeper reflection about one's commitments and priorities.<br><br>All these different dynamics come into play as you work the list, changing from page to page, from cycle to cycle.  <br><br>I do admit, every now and then I just want to throw the whole list out the window, but that's generally because I'm getting stir-crazy and just need to get away from my computer or my desk.  Or maybe because some days I don't have any discretionary time and I feel frustrated about my slow speed of cycling.   I don't think it's the list or the method itself.  Once I take a break, go outside and water the trees, or play tag with my toddler, or walk down for a coffee break with my colleagues, I'm always happy to get back to my list.   It provides variety as well as stability.   And dismissal helps ensure the overall workload is reasonable and can really fit within the discretionary time available -- which varies from week to week.<br><br>Long way of saying:  all Mark's systems from AF onward already provide dynamic adjustment of how one's work actually get done, depending on your situation.   I think Mark is just trying to find a better way to make this happen so that C2 adjusts itself to your situation better than it does with the current SF rules.</div>

Just wondered whether this is the type of thing you are looking to handle through your experiments because I'd be very interested.  I find keeping an item that I feel is urgent for today, available in the right place in the pages of the list, so I can choose to do it if it stands out, is a challenge.  Maybe the SF list won't do it.  Having the snooze and move forward a page seemed to be able to handle it.  Many thanks for the constant testing for improvement!</div>

<div class="meta">2011-05-8 23:33</div>
<div class="content">Are you a New User?  Please let me say a few things that may help you:<br><br>I am also waiting like Frank on news (with a degree of both awe and anxiousness).  I tried to sum up some rules to go by for now, with and without the *snooze*, with and without the automatic demotion, etc.  There are so many good comments and contributions in these posts that one wants to embrace them all.  I ended up with pages of notes.  I firmly believe that this site contains more practical solutions to managing one’s *control* than all the other systems’ blogs combined, and then some.  <br><br>Have you (the ones with experience) tried to explain the Forster Systems to someone that knows absolutely nothing about these things, not even Gtd?  It is not easy.  You can mention the SF Rules, throw in a couple of excellent points from “Variation Update”, and “Yet Another Variation”, but it is difficult to really lay down the foundation (for me, anyway), or just the sheer value of this methodology to someone in a short conversation or demonstration of a 2-column list.<br><br>Bernie made a point very well about trying to manage tasks in ‘batches’ and closed lists.  This reminded me of my unsuccessful Day Plans and the constant struggle to just do today what you ‘need’ to do, not even coming close to anything outside this ‘batch’ or even coming close to finishing the list by the end of the day.<br><br>The methods here are the only way, in my opinion, to not feel ‘hemmed in’ (another term from Bernie, I believe).  Because the challenge is to know what to do (that you really need to do, i.e, not blocked by everything else).  The Forster Systems avoid these traps better than anything I have seen.  It (they) promotes you to stick with something, and to avoid those somethings from falling through the cracks.<br><br>So my point (New Users) is to stick with this thing and don’t worry about the Rules and their Variations too much at this point in the evolvement of SF basics.  There is something here that needs to be grasped.  Especially if you’re one of those types (like me) that went from system to system (Outlook, Time and Chaos, Life Balance, Toodledo, Things, and finally the big step with OmniFocus on the iPad) (or whatever).<br><br>I was just searching for some key words, and again I found comments from Bernie explaining that for items for which formal planning is not needed, (here) they end up done without engaging us in “superfluous questions of category, priority, time estimates, etc.” (GTD).    Well said.<br><br>One more comment from Bernie; this time a direct quote:  <<SuperFocus has almost zero footprint when it is not needed but jumps up in your face (dismissal) when it is.  I cannot overstate how brilliant that is.>><br><br>To me, these comments sum it up, and hit the nail right on the head (regarding the practical value of this methodology, anyway).<br><br>So, while the temptation during these Variation “experiments” by all you priceless contributors (and of course, Mark) must be something on the order of becoming a “perfeccionista” to sort out the way to handle the balance between new, old, urgent, non-urgent, recurring, one-time, muti-step, etc. tasks, I hope New Users don’t get their heads spinning by reading too much at this point and avoiding giving it a whirl just using the basics.  <br><br>Thank you Mark, and thank you Bernie, Alan, Jupiter, Seraphim, and SO MANY others, for the time and effort you all have thus far put into this!</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Wow, I haven't visited here for a long time...<br><br>Mark, if I understand your new SFv3 variation, then I think it is possible to replicate what you are trying to do as a variation of "Ping Pong" AF1: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/988459" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/988459</a><br><br>I mean, in this variation of SFv3, we add urgent and unfinished tasks, and even C2 items in the current page if going to the next page or upon dismissal, into the next page C2, right?  So why not simplify everything: remove C2 (going back to old AF1), add all tasks (new, urgent, and unfinished) at the end of the list, work on the list AF1 style, then create a rule that you go to the end of the list when we need to do urgent or unfinished tasks, then go back to your current page after.  So what will happen (for those not familiar with the "Ping Pong" variation of AF) is that you "bounce" from your current page of the list to the end of the list and back, hence the name of "Ping-Pong".<br><br>Actually come to think of it, a "One-Column C2" effect can even be added to the Ping-Pong AF1 (kinda like what you did for DWM to make DWM2): add a preceding symbol (maybe a heavy dot?) to each urgent and unfinished task added to the end of the list, and draw a horizontal line just above the first "C2 item" in the list (i.e. just above the C2 item furthest away from the end of the list).  When it is time to go through the C2 items, we just process the list from the end backwards, acting only on the symbolized C2 items, UP TO the first drawn horizontal line we come up with (since there will be no active C2 items above this line).  When the C2 item just below this line is deleted, a new horizontal line is drawn just above the next C2 item furthest away from the end of the list.<br><br>I hope all of that was clear.<br><br>Anyways, what do you think?<br><br>God bless.<br><br>EDIT: I haven't thought of rules on how to process this variation yet, I just wanted to present the idea that a one-column SuperFocus variant is possible.</div>

The problem in DWM2 was that items to be deleted after the seventh day were mixing up with items that were up to seven days old.

In the same way, I propose to add a symbol before each C2 item (maybe a heavy dot) to distinguish them from the other tasks.<br><br>"They are spread about among other non-C2 tasks and are to be found on more than one page.

<div class="content"><<I think I've decided that none of the variations yet are better than the present "official" rules, so I'm going back to them.>> (Mark Forster)<br><br>Even though I really like the ideas behind certain variations, I keep lapsing back to the canonical rules unintentionally. Partly it is force of habit, but also something about the compulsory C2 just feels more right or satisfying. Perhaps actioning every C2 item gives me a nice feeling that the page is "finished" before I turn it.<br><br>Since Monday, though, I am actually finding the "all C2 entries go on next page" rule very satisfying, so perhaps this will be the one variation that sticks for me. It is beginning to feel wrong to enter things on the current page, violating its closed-list nature.</div>

<div class="content">I'm kind of falling into a Do What Seems Right variation.  Do an urgent task current page or next, drop an unfinished task (finish it) any time. When I come to a page do any task in any order. Sometimes C2 calls; sometimes a break from C2 is more important. Sometimes a C2 isn't ready to be actioned or dropped, so I push it back. Sometimes I just do things as they come up.  I dismiss a page when it's getting full or insuffcient action is taken.   I've taken a preference to short 15-item pages, but this varies. <br><br>The only strict rule is to empty C2 one way or another before moving on.  <br>So it's all very intuition-driven, and doesn't seem to cause major problems.</div>

<div class="content">I've been thinking of C2 as "shifting to high gear".  The analogy works pretty well.<br><br>When I'm driving my truck, it's usually very clear what gear I should be driving in.  If I'm on the highway, I need to be in high gear, and I can get somewhere quickly (= drive a task to completion, or take quick action on an urgent task).   <br><br>But if there's an accident on the road, or some other obstacle, I may need to switch to low gear for awhile (= demote the task to C1 because something else is taking priority right now).<br><br>I can get off the highway, go down a side road, do some errands, etc.  Lower gear.  (= ordinary C1 tasks).<br><br>I do follow rules when I'm driving, but circumstances sometimes demand that I apply the rules differently or set them aside temporarily.  When there's an emergency situation that demands special attention and unusual action, following the ordinary rules can be deadly.  <br><br>In the same way, I generally follow the C2 rules pretty strictly as written in the original rules, but if I really need to demote a task back to C2, then I do it.  And if I want to move a bit faster, then I clear C2 before looking at C1.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure how helpful this post will be (particularly as I haven't made the time to review recent forum threads thoroughly); so feel free to ignore or redirect me as appropriate ...<br><br>My guess is that we all know the holy grail of time management is never going to be fully discovered (at least, not unequivocably). That said, the search is certainly enjoyable, and the closer one gets, the more productive one becomes (or in the case of this website, the closer Mark gets, the more productive we all become).<br><br>Having intermittently witnessed the DIT/AF/DWM/SF journey thus far, it still strikes me that SF is pretty much head and shoulders above the other systems when all variables are taken into consideration (although I'm aware there are those on this forum who would take exception to this claim).<br><br>I wonder if the search should move on from developing a further version of SF which is the 'ultimate version' (recognising that SF may be as close as we'll ever get to the ultimate version), and it is now a case of searching for how that version might be best tweaked for different situations/contexts/personalities? <br><br>As such, SF becomes the gold-standard, but it has different 'variants' depending on who is applying it and where they are applying it (ie. SF for project managers; SF for stay at home parents; SF for the chronically disorganised; SF for the high schooler, etc.).<br><br>I wonder if this approach might counteract the risk of SF evenutally becoming yet another (albeit very good) time management system within the TM community, rather than what it (arguably) could become: Something which transcends a 'yet another good time management system' and something which can influence the productivity of a wider audience? <br><br>Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">I agree!<br><br>Every time I read something from GTP's David Allen, I can't help thinking how SF solves all the issues he raises.  His solutions seem so vague and complex in comparison.  That's why I am calling his system GTP.   GTP is great at Getting Things Planned, but SF is so much better at Getting Things DONE.   I wish all the GTPers out there would just give SF a try!</div>

<div class="content">GTP - that is funny, Seraphim! And particularly true in my experience as well.<br><br>neumatist, I agree with all that, and I think you might find Seraphim's "anxiety" criterion has a lot of adaptive power to address it: When reentering a task, first consider C1. If you feel too anxious about reaching it again promptly in C1, then consider C2 of next page. If that too makes you worry, then write it in C2 of this page.<br><br>When I get confused about the variation(s) I am trying, I often revert to Seraphim's method, often unintentionally and only noticing it after the pattern has built up for a while. In fact, this morning I found myself doing it, as I had stayed up way too late, slept in, and then rushed through the morning. Being in a hurry kills the satisfaction of "all C2's on next page," so while I mostly tried to keep to this next-page-C2 variation, I wrote my especially-impending items on the current page. Why? Because they made me nervous.<br><br>One could extend this to cover the rule(s) about working C2 vs. C1. In other words, if you are worried about the list facing you in C2, then by all means, follow the path of least anxiety, and knock out those C2's before turning to C1. But if C2 is nice and relaxed, then take a stroll through C1 for a bit. Either way, I think one needs to clear C2, even if it means carrying forward tasks that are un-actioned or out of context. But even then, who's to say you can't "park" a C2 task and move on if you can feel it losing its relevance but are not ready to think about it right now?<br><br>Seems to me, these "anxiety" criteria provide much situational flexibility and are very much in keeping with Mark Forster's intuitive design principles. They also provide a superset encompassing most (if not all) of the SF variations we've been trying here.<br><br>Perhaps we merely need modify canonical SFv3's "common sense rule" to read "anxiety rule." How far does that take us toward neumatist's Holy Grail?</div>

<div class="content">The anxiety rule works both ways for me.  Sometimes I find myself going in the opposite direction of the Holy Grail by, in effect, prioritising  urgents and uncomfortable tasks by copying a C2 forward, or hopping around too much.  The farther I get away from the basics, the harder it is to come back.  I have to remind myself why I am here in the first place.   <br>Even though the original SF rules work fine, it would be nice to know the consensus on many of the points and ideas outside the original SF rules.  This might help me find some non-basic methods less convenient, or at least stop me from continually trying out new things (and getting confused).  Anyway, whatever I do, it sure is better than what I was doing before.</div>
