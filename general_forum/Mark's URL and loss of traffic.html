<div class="content">It took me 4 days to figure out that: markforster.net/fv-forum/, no longer works. I wonder how many others are having similar problems.</div>

<div class="content">Yep, me too. I get the message "Too many redirects" so I suspect Mark has added one "widget" too many, or Squarespace have changed something.</div>

<div class="content">Correction: it didn't work on the weekend but it works now by taking you to squarespace.</div>

<div class="content">Finally managed to find <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com</a> . The old  <a href="http://www.markforster.net" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net</a> redirects to <a href="http://markforster.net" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.net</a> then gives me the "too many redirects" message.<br><br>Mmm ... On this new URL Andreas' <a href="http://github.com/andreashofmann/markforster.net-improvement-userscript" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/andreashofmann/markforster.net-improvement-userscript</a> will of course not work. So now back to jotting down when I last visit this forum.</div>

<div class="content">About the (wonderful, useful) userscript: on Firefox, anyway, I was able to get it working again without much trouble. Here's what I did:<br><br>- Go to Tools/  Greasemonkey/ Manage User Scripts....<br>- The Add-ons Manager window will open, showing your Greasemonkey scripts<br>- For markforster.net improvements 2, click on Options<br>- On the User Settings tab, next to Included Pages, click Add<br>- In the resulting dialogue box, type <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/*" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/*</a> (sorry that comes out looking like a clickable URL--again, it's just the text you should type) and click Okay<br>- Back at the User Settings tab, click Okay<br><br>After that, when you return to Mark's site using the URL that includes "squarespace," the user script should work.<br><br>Hope that helps.</div>

<div class="content">The big loss is the subsequent lack of activity.  All conversation ceased since the interruption.</div>

<div class="content">I made assumption that change of URL to include squarespace was that Mark changed to a lower service fee without custom URL. many services have such 2 tiered price. however on looking at squarespace fees, both the standard and unlimited include Custom Domain FREE. so this is odd.<br><br>I assume Mark knows this? someone need to give squarespace a nudge?</div>

<div class="content">Looked to me like <a href="http://www.markforster.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.com</a> was redirecting to <a href="http://markforster.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.com</a> and then back to <a href="http://www.markforster.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.com</a> and so on....<br><br>Maybe the URL redirection was changed inadvertently so it redirected back and forth.</div>

<div class="content">In Chrome to get Andreas Userscript working again, I had to edit a local copy of the extension per <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2250163/how-do-directly-modify-a-google-chrome-extension-file-crx" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2250163/how-do-directly-modify-a-google-chrome-extension-file-crx</a></div>
