You then marked a task that stood out to you with the direction of your scan. After completing the marked task for now, you then scan down the list starting from the first task.</div>

<div class="content">I'm having a good day with this system! Getting plenty done. Started working down from the top this morning and I am now onto my 14th task. No 'weirdness' with urgent tasks either. <br><br>To keep the list a manageable length: Hitting the bottom line of the latest page is my signal to then carry over only the essential few items from the previous page. The previous page is then dismissed by drawing a diagonal line across it to the outer top corner of the page. This means that there will never be more than 2 open pages at a time. However, many of the tasks will already have been worked on so hopefully this should not mean there would be 2 open pages full of unactioned tasks!</div>

<div class="content">Is this effectively AF2 from alternate ends of the list? AF2 then Reverse AF2?</div>

I've got six open pages at the moment and no feeling that the list is beginning to seize up. Of course it's important to keep any list well weeded so I've crossed individual tasks out that I didn't feel were going anywhere.</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>Perhaps the dismissal rules from AF2 make even more sense then... no excuse that you've not got back to the items on "notice".</div>

<div class="content">Caibre65:<br><br>I've not yet felt the need for any dismissal rules. I've only got two tasks left on the first page (out of 31 lines per page) and I know they'll both get done soon. There's five on the second page but I'm not concerned about any of them either.</div>

<div class="content">< In this example you began with a scan up from the last task on the list. You then marked a task that stood out to you with the direction of your scan. After completing the marked task for now, you then scan down the list starting from the first task. > <br><br>It's funny how I interpreted the rule differently: For example after working on an item marked with a 'V' I continue working downwards until I reach the bottom of the list. At that point I start working my way back up the list with the arrowhead pointing upwards. Not sure if this is correct or not but I think I prefer working the list in this way. <br><br>Thanks also Mark for the advice about dismissal i.e. not needing it -- I'll see how that goes, although I don't like having more than a few open pages at a time if I can help it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: thanks for clarifying,  I will report back. I'm also finding the list is keeping tight so far / not getting stretched - so perhaps the ad-ons around dismissal may be redundant.</div>
