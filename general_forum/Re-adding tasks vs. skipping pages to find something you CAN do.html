<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">As I get down to the last couple of tasks on quite a few pages at the front of my personal/home book, I find quite a few tasks that I can't do because of basically two circumstances:<br><br>1)  Very bad weather (we're talking -28C with windchill here), so items like vacuum the car, wash the car, really can't get done and I haven't been able to in the last 3 weeks<br>2)  They require a longer block of time than I have during the week for a project that can't be chunked down - may involve taking my son somewhere fun that's in the city, so it's a 4-6 hour time commitment, or doing a renovation job that requires rented tools<br><br>I really want to leave them on the list where they are because I don't want to get them buried in the new pages and want them to stand out for me next weekend (+10 temperatures at last) - which they will because they're the last things on the list.  I'm afraid that if they're buried in new stuff next weekend when I come to them I won't feel drawn to do them.  Note that I have no aversion to doing them at all.<br><br>I was thinking of just having a scheduled weekend for these bigger items so I can knock them off the list at last.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>You could always use the "index card" approach - put them on your "action now" list and use that list with your current page.  I have been trying that approach for tasks that need to be done "this week" but using a Mind Map - adds more fun to that list, particularly if the items are not!</div>

<div class="content">If I come across items I cannot do now and during the next days e.g. due to the season I dismiss them, write the task on a piece of paper and put this paper in my tickler file at an appropriate place (e.g. April if wintertime is the problem).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine, They're all tasks that don't need to be done - this week or possibly any week at all.  To follow the AF rules would indicate dismissal as there would have been multiple times I would have come across them.  <br><br>Christian, I live in Chinook country, so we may have -30C one week and +20C the next.  Kind of a continual winter/summer - sometimes all in the same day.  The strange weather patterns tend to rule out having any sense of knowing what the weather will be, however, this has been an unseasonably cold winter.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I would say that the answer then is to dismiss them.  Don't forget the instruction to review dismissed items.  When the weather is right (if ever!) just add them back.  If you are regularly reviewing your dismissed items you will have a feel for what needs to go back and on that magical day when the weather is perfect then it may be a case that you readd, realise that it "has" to be done today so you can just do it!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine, your post made me wonder if I shouldn't put "review dismissed items (and do one if applicable) on the list more often.  I only have it written on one page.  Now I wish I hadn't dumped so much stuff into the list and dismissed so heartily those tasks I wasn't committed to doing in the next month.  I don't regret the dismissing, just the dumping.  Maybe I need a different colour highlighter for those items that can be done when the weather cooperates - maybe blue for blue skies... :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline - you could put those items on a special "blue skies" dismissed list - with a nice blue sky background!  Then each time you look at it it'll make you laugh and you wont forget them. :-)</div>
