<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-03-7 3:14</div>
<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br><br>After working for so long with all of the different time management systems -- GTD, DIT, AF, DWM, and then back to AF1....I am going to try something a little different.  One of the things I have had problems with is having one long list of everything at work together -- no matter what the system.  Standard contexts in GTD did not work that well for me.  So now I am going to try something Mark posted some time ago, but with a new wrinkle.<br><br>I wear so many different hats at work.  I have significant administrative responsibilities and all of the endless busy, but important work associated with being a chair.  Then I am a researcher, with an NIH-funded laboratory with research assistants, grad students, dental students, undergraduate students, post-docs, etc.  Then I have all of the manuscripts and book chapters I am writing.  And let's not forget teaching.  And more committees.  Ah, the life of a professor.<br><br>SO what I am going to do is to start to keep separate running lists under separate "Areas of Focus", a GTD-type term.   This way, I will be able to monitor better each of my areas of responsibiltiy to make sure I am keeping some balance in my work.  How will I work those lists?  Does everyone remember Mark's post entitled "The simplest time management method?"  Here is the link:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/11/17/the-simplest-time-management-method.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/11/17/the-simplest-time-management-method.html</a><br><br>I will use Mark's approach on each of these lists.  I will use my intuition and blocking off time for areas as needed and work off of those particular lists.  If I have a few things left above the line on one list, and they no longer seem important/stand out....I will use an AF approach and dismiss them and then redraw the line.<br><br>Urgent things that come up....well, as Mark has always said, I will use my common sense on things, and if something comes up and needs to be done, I will just do it.  Tasks with hard due dates will be tracked in Outlook 2007.  I will keep a separate projects list and of course, project support materials.  I will still use entries like "Work on Project X".<br><br>At any rate, I am going to give this a try.  Oh....and apart from the hard due date items....this will all be on paper in a nice notebook with divided sections.<br><br>I would love to hear comments, concerns, suggestions, from colleagues here....<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I'll start by guessing what Norman's biting back: You are switching systems weekly.  Is this really helping you?  <br><br>I'm inclined to agree, in part.  At some point you do need to settle down and just go with the flow.  Pick a system that does a fair job for you.  Adapt it to your context.  Get really good at that system.  And stick to it.<br>-----<br>Now your idea here does sound promising David.  I've been thinking this same direction myself though I've not yet gone there.  I understand you to suggest you will have a designated time for working on one area of focus.  When you are in that zone you will focus on items above the line, following this "simplest" method.<br><br>Some thoughts on that.  Bear in mind that system predates autofocus just slightly and lacks some later refinements:<br><br>Quoting Mark's blog post "[I] didn’t allow myself to work on them [items below the line] until I had finished all the items up to the line."  I'm thinking it might be more appropriate to focus above the line but allow work below the line.<br><br>Mark: "I try to keep the time from drawing one line to drawing the next at not more than one day. Any longer than that and my response time to emails, etc., is going to be too slow."  Given you have many projects at once, etc., I suppose you might want a longer period than 1 day.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-03-7 5:31</div>
<div class="content">David, my concern is that balance is a word we bat around when we are over-committed. It means we're going to try and do a half-baked job in every area and convince ourselves we're succeeding. The problem is, deep down we know we're not. Probably any TM approach will enable you to get by in the short-term, but sooner or later, one of those plates you're spinning will come crashing down. I've seen too many faculty members pay the price for their overwork in marital breakdown, cancer, and premature death. <br><br>What's sad is that when we're in that crazy busy place, we can't see that there's anything that can be cut out. Yet when our health falls apart, something HAS to be cut out. So it's really a matter of choosing to cut back before the crisis or after. <br><br>I do not say this in a critical way at all. I've essentially been where you are and have insisted to people who just didn't "understand" that I had no choices. I hope you will find your way to seeing that you do indeed have choices (albeit difficult ones) that have nothing to do with paper or digital, kwim? I wish you all the best.</div>

<div class="content">OK, so you're going to create a to-do list for each area of your life, essentially.  Sounds sensible.  Based on your prior posts, you spend a great deal of time on time management systems, which makes me wonder how you get anything done.</div>

<div class="content">@David Drake<br>> As for TK....I get more done in one week than you could imagine. You have no idea. I doubt you could keep up with me.<br><br>I even don't want to. It just doesn't sound desirable at all to me to have so many different hats at work with so many tasks and to be so extremely busy. Life is more than work and more than needing to be always busy to show your self-worth / importance / prestige and not come across as a sluggard (Ger: Faulpelz) or even as a looser at all. <br><br>But I totally respect what you do - it's just not attractive to me to squeeze the last bit of efficiency out of one's life.<br><br>For your information I was a competitive athlete in my youth but I have come over it. I don't need to match with s.o. and win anymore to increase my feeling of self-worth.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>I got my retainer back. <br><br>Alan was partially correct. You posts are all over the place. They are lengthy, boastful, and dare I say histrionic. I offer all of this for your own good. I've been around newsgroups before most folks heard of something called an internet. The best groups are where folks are honest sometimes without being vulgar.<br><br>You fantasize about TK and what he is able to accomplish. The fact is things get done. We all have the same amount of participation. Some of us just highlight our participation more and crow about it. Nothing wrong about it cause that helps things get done as well, but as Mel suggests there can be deleterious effects. I dunno about marital difficulty, illness, or decreased longevity, but I do know that taking yourself seriously robs one of a sense of humor which for me trumps all of the above.<br><br>Forget the back forth with all the AF and DWM, recall these statements:<br><br>"I do not think I wish to be on this forum anymore as I do not like the way things are going here. I am leaving. I am sure I will not be missed. Best regards to all of you here that wanted to discuss AF and time management systems. I am moving back to the GTD forums.<br><br>-David "<br><br>"I said I was leaving. Best wishes to everyone, especially Mark Forster, who I think is the best.

There were more.<br><br>I didn't say it at the time, but I knew you would stick around. This is classic forum / newsgroup attention-getting behavior.<br><br>On another forum, I would analyze this further and other behavior further, but really why the turbulence? You might think my words harsh, but I truly mean them with charity. The quotes are simply facts.<br><br>These are more words than I care to use. Generally it is better to cut to the quick, especially when someone like Mel can play the empathetic role.<br><br>In any case, my apology:<br><br>Dilige et quod vis fac.</div>

<div class="content">O.K.  Before this goes too far south. ;-)<br><br>Norman is 100% right.  (Though I do think that subtracting the "brutal" from "brutal honesty" would be a big plus ;-)<br><br>David:  Before you take Norman's advice and try to fix what is wrong with you ;-) I think you are probably on the right track in trying to get control of your time.<br><br>It is not your TM system that is the problem, as Mel says.  It is that you are trying to get 20 pounds into a 10 pound sack.  NO SYSTEM ON EARTH will help you accomplish that.  What you MUST do, for sanity's sake, is get back to basics.<br><br>- How many hours a day are you willing to work?<br>- How efficient are you?  (And I mean really, not in your dreams!)<br>- What are the CRUCIAL elements of your job?  Those you MUST do.<br>- What are IMPORTANT elements of your job?  Those you SHOULD do.<br>- What are the EXPECTED but UNIMPORTANT parts of your job?  Those you SHOULD NOT do.<br><br>Now decide how you are going to address those, given the time you are willing to spend.  You are going to have to say NO a lot more than you have.  I think just about every TM author has made that point.  Mark makes it in his book on GED.  No one can do everything.  To think you have is a sign of something else you need to address.  (Discuss that with Norman ;-)  Or if you like, contact me privately and I'll see if I can help.)<br><br>Time is finite so goals must also be finite.  What are you willing to give up?  That single question is so important to you that if you don't address it, you'll go 'round and 'round starting and stopping systems.<br><br>If I can share my delusion of you ... I get the impression that experimenting with TM systems is your way of salving the pain.  If you got drunk, people would more easily see it, perhaps.  But switching systems weekly is about the same thing as drinking to forget.  I'm serious.<br><br>Given what I've read of you over the months, here is my RX.<br><br>- Answer the above questions.<br>- Make a PLAN<br>- Forget the whole AF and Intuitive "standing out" approach -- That is just not for you!<br>- Select those things you WILL do and forget the rest, let the consequences be damned<br>- Decide what is an ACCEPTABLE level of performance for each project.  Be willing to do some things to a lower standard of excellence than if you had forever to make it perfect.<br>- Prioritize your projects<br>- List what you can do NEXT for each project (a la David Allen)<br>- Prioritize those<br>- SCHEDULE those<br>- BLOCK TIME for those<br>- DO THOSE<br>- Lather, Rinse, Repeat<br><br>Take Mel's words seriously, man.  We'll be reading about you in the newspaper if you don't get a grip.  Give up trying to do it all.  You just can't.  No one can.</div>

<div class="content">This has been one of the most interesting threads to read on this forum recently, though for all the wrong reasons. :)<br><br>With apologies in advance to David, doesn't this demonstrate how hard it is for us to see that *we* are mostly the cause of our time management problems, not the system.

Not sure the "wrong reasons" Frank mentioned.  <br>Mike: Using a system is of course an essential ingredient to success with that system.  But not every system works.  The question is whether the system gives good answers to the hows you mention, or inadequate answers given your context.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-03-7 14:53</div>
<div class="content">Regarding David's original question, I am contemplating going back to a GTD-like system of capture, process, organize and review, while "doing" using an AF approach of using each context as a closed list, and not switching contexts until nothing else stands out in that context.  If nothing stands out on the first pass, move to Someday/Maybe or else clarify and reword.<br><br>I will also comment that I often find it beneficial to change task mgmt systems occasionally because it forces me to engage with ALL my tasks while transferring them from system to system (outlook to paper, paper to Outlook, Outlook to Outlook, etc.).  I was most productive when switching from GTD to AF and then again switching back.  After a while, any system loses its luster if you're not willing to engage with the tasks within it.<br><br>I'm sure there's an analogy with the "missionary position," but I shall not elaborate. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Well....wow....did I ever get a response.  I thank everyone for their comments.  I greatly appreciate the genuine concern so many people have expressed for my well-being.  I am sincere about that. <br><br>I was just trying to bounce ideas of how to approach work when one has so many responsibilities.  So some answers are in order.<br><br>(1) Yes, my work goes way beyond 60 hours a week -- more like 80.  Do I enjoy it?  Yes, I am a scientist and passionate about what I do.  So, yes, I want to work this much.  I fully realize that most people do not wish to work as I do.  That does not mean that what they do is ANY less important.  So, I am sorry, Norman -- and I mean that -- I did not mean to set myself on a pedestal.<br>(2) Norman, you say my posts are boastful.  Okay -- fair enough.  I am proud of what I do, my role in helping children with devastating oral diseases ( I am a specialist in infectious diseases).  My response to TK, who wondered if I ever got anything done, was only to indicate that I really do get quite a bit accomplished.  Okay, the statement that I spend a lot of time on time management systems.  Hmmm....well, we have been through DIT, four versions of AF, and now DWM.  I think it is fair to say a lot of us have spent considerable time on time management systems.  If we did not, then all of us would still be doing DIT.  Why try something else?  Because Mark brings his new systems to us and we are excited to try them out.<br><br>Well....to finish.  Norman, I must say, of all people that have posted on this site, you are the most interesting.  I am just glad you are not one of my faculty.  Smiles....<br><br>I truly apologize if I have caused angst on this forum.  I will refrain from posting my boastful comments.  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I have known for a long time that I am overcommitted, and may well be in competition with David for the number of overcommitments.  :-)   I think I still hold the record for total number of open tasks on my AFx lists - I think it was over 1400 at one point.  :-)<br><br>The problem has always been trying to gauge which particular commitments are causing the trouble and what to do about it.<br><br>AF1 was great at helping me get a sense of "balance" and to hone my intuition to decide when to switch from one commitment to another, when to switch from one context to another, and when to take a break by doing something "light".<br><br>But with AF1, my list just kept growing.  It was possible to keep adding stuff, with no real mechanism for whittling down the list.  Individual pages and their tasks could get "dismissed", but for each dismissed page, I had 10 new pages full of tasks.  The growing size of the list made it very difficult to keep up with urgent tasks -- I couldn't cycle through the list fast enough to make sure I saw the urgent tasks frequently enough.<br> <br>AF4 did a better job of presenting me with the urgent tasks more frequently, but it didn't help reduce the growth of the list.  It had the same issues as AF1 in that respect.  Every time I finally shut down my Closed List and started a new one, the new one was always longer than any previous one.  Before switching to DWM my Closed List had reach about 30 pages, I think, still about 30-40% uncompleted on average.<br><br>DWM has the best mechanism so far for flagging when you've simply got too much stuff going on, too many commitments.  The stuff will simply drop off the list if you don't take care of it, and if you find that really important stuff is dropping off the list, then that's the flag that you have too many commitments.  This is working well for me -- it's helping me figure out exactly where the problems are.  <br><br>I really like DWM because it preserves the best parts of AFx (the "standing out" that brings together your intuition and your intellect, and the freedom of "doing whatever you want, for as long as you want") while giving you a much more effective "dismissal" function that allows you to diagnose your overload much more effectively.  I am finding it works especially well when combined with the "current initiative first" rule that Mark suggested.<br><br>I have always tried very hard to work these systems without tweaks.  Constantly tweaking, besides taking up lots of time, also ends up with confusion.  You never really know if you've made things any better.</div>

<div class="content">David, if you enjoy your workload, then you are NOT at greater risk of burnout than those of us with a lighter load. It's positive stress then. You still need a method of managing the madness, however. I can't figure out if you're a nuts and bolts kind of guy that should stick with time blocking or even DWM or you're the type who constantly needs the shot in the arm of a new approach.<br><br>One thing that seems to work for me is to make it okay to use different approaches. IOW, stop searching for the Holy Grail of TM. This week or even today, choose the approach that appeals most to you and use it. For example, I reverted to an old FLYLady approach today and worked for 45 minutes and took a break for 15. You might take this a step further and make a list of all the TM approaches and tools you like (Pomodoro, Action Machine, GTD, DIT, AFx, DWM, software, etc.) and on any given day or week choose the one that stands out. No more "What's wrong with me that I can't make X work permanently?" <br><br>BTW, I thought you handled the feedback really well.</div>

<div class="content">"Constantly tweaking, besides taking up lots of time, also ends up with confusion. You never really know if you've made things any better."<br><br>I'd like to contradict. People are different, and what works for the one don't has to work for another (this is even true for basic things like food - not two human beings have exactly the same metabolism!). And although it is difficult to know what is better BEFORE you try it, it's relatively easy to know once you SEE it - or here: EXPERIENCE it. <br><br>All you need to do is to stick with a tweak for several weeks. Once you've got the habit, you FEEL whether it works for you or not. (You just have to ignore any theories why it SHOULD work... ;-D)<br><br>And you know that you have found the system that really works for you when you notice that you are no longer that much interested in other systems. That's how it went for me: Over the last year, being here, following the evolution of AF, I have worked out a system of tweaks that I use meanwhile for several months, and my urge to visit the AF forum (where at times I looked up several times a day) has almost disappeared. Plus the urge to testdrive new tweaks has vanished as well, because everything runs just smoothly, even in periods of heavy workload and tight deadlines.<br><br>So, it didn't end up with confusion - on the contrary!<br><br>Or in other words: You look for tweaks as long as a basically good system doesn't fit you 100%. It's like trying a new piece of clothing on: If it doesn't fit everywhere, you feel uncomfortable - even if it's a good piece of clothing. What do you do? You change it here and there... and one day it just fits, and you stop thinking about it! You just wear it.</div>

<div class="content">David<br><br>I've met a handful of people that I considered good at managing their time and whom I worked with closely enough to see how they did it.  This is what they had in common.<br><br>1. Most tasks were dispatched as they arrived.  They were responsive and decisive.<br><br>2. They were elegant in adding what they could quickly and passing the batton on.  There was no putting it on a list/pile to think about.<br><br>3. They were very clear what they wanted from others.  They tended not to follow up.  However if others didn't deliver they were direct about the impact that had.  Sufficiently direct so people didn't fail to deliver a second time.<br><br>4. They didn't use a list based time management system.  Every few days they made a list of the 5 or 6 big projects they had on the go.  Not detailed plans just a short list of the project names.<br><br>5. Projects requiring complex scheduling of resources were delegated.    <br><br>I think DWM adds well to this for the myriad of tasks that we think of to do but don't necessarily have to do.  DWM is a good place to catch such tasks and there's an expiry date.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the nice comments.  Seraphim, your post was compelling and at one time, I was working with a GTD/DWM hybrid.  I may consider going back to that.  I realize now that what I had posted was probably not such a good idea.  But it was just an idea....<br><br>Mel, you are correct....the quest for the Holy Grail of time management systems is fraught with danger.  However, I agree with Andreas in that one always wants things to "fit" the best possible.  Andreas, I really like your "good piece of clothing" analogy.  But I do need to pick a horse and ride it.  <br><br>Oh, and Mel....thanks for your kind words on my handling of the feedback.  <br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">MoK,<br><br>Interesting, like you I've met a "handful", they don;t grow on trees and they don't like it up 'em, to coin two phrases.<br><br>I reckon one can only learn the odd thing or two from them because they have no obvious system.<br><br>You raise a very valid point about "think of to do, but not necessarily have to do".  That;s got to be a major cause of some DWM/AF practitioners having such long lists.  Like you, this is where I know DWM is helping.<br><br>I guess the trick is being able to decide what NOT to bother writing down, but my gaeing brain increasingly copes by writing too much down, although not on the same scale as others.<br><br>One's inbred filtering system must be great asset, such as that enjoyed by the handful.  I bet those guys don't have to do what I did this weekend: deleting old emails that I thought I might need one day, gone into cyberspace they are now.</div>

I wasn't trying to say that tweaks themselves are bad or useless.  We all need to find what works for us.  But once we've found something that does a decent job, maybe it's better to stick with it unchanged for a good while before rejiggering everything.  If your system is basically effective, spending a few hours several times a week or month trying new tweaks to make the perfect optimized system is TMitis, not TM, IMO.  :-)<br><br>Maybe for some, the process of constant tweaking helps to get insight into how you really work and how to be really effective.  Maybe for some people, constant tweaking has a high ROI.  But I doubt this is often really the case.</div>

<div class="content">I forgot to say thank you to Mike for his wonderful comments and suggestions.  In fact, your prescribed RX is pretty much what I have been doing.  I have just been trying to make other systems work around my hard scheduling.<br><br>Thanks, Mike, for your concern and very nice comments.  It is most appreciated.  Take care.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, you have tried enough systems to know none of them will fix too much work.  TM systems just don't do that.  After trying most systems including the two I wrote, I have gone as simple as possible.  I am using a Steno Notebook to track what I need to do and have focused on a very simple yet workable filing system.  I use one tool to capture my to-dos.  It has freed up all of the organizing, tweaking, reviewing, next actioning and all else and put that time to use doing.  I have no formal review method, other than when I finish something, I look at the notepad again for what I think I need to do next.<br><br>I have found this simple cheap system better than any other I have used.  That said, if I had 80 hours a week of work and only wanted to work 60 hours a week, nothing would fix it.  <br><br>Look at the cost of your time management system and make sure you are efficient and it actually is saving you time, for me GTD did not.  Beyond that you will need to either keep doing the hours or change your commitments.  Good luck as I know you have wrestled with this for some time now.<br><br>The article is here if anyone wants to see it.<br><br><a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5957531_improve-time-management-steno-notebook.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_5957531_improve-time-management-steno-notebook.html</a><br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim wrote<br><br>DWM has the best mechanism so far for flagging when you've simply got too much stuff going on, too many commitments.  .... <br>I really like DWM because it preserves the best parts of AFx (the "standing out" that brings together your intuition and your intellect, and the freedom of "doing whatever you want, for as long as you want") while giving you a much more effective "dismissal" function that allows you to diagnose your overload much more effectively.<br><br><br>I agree with all of this.  And I would add one more benefit I am experiencing.  Each list is on average 15x smaller than AF4 (your todos are spread over 30 days, rather than in an open and closed list) which I find makes for a much reduced feeling of overwhelm.  <br><br>(This is the flip side of having to flip many pages which some have moaned about.  Every sow's ear has a silver lining.)</div>
