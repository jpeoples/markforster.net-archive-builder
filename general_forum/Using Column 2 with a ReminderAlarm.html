<div class="content">Here are some things I write in Column 2 (on the current page) when prompted by an Outlook reminder or a cell-phone alarm, and it works great:<br><br>- "Watering" (recurs 6 AM every other day) -- stays in Column 2 during the day, till all the watering is done for the day. It also provides a nice physical break from the desk / computer.<br><br>- "Feed dogs" (recurs 4 PM every day) -- dogs get fed within an hour or two, and task is deleted<br><br>- "Vitamins" (recurs 6 AM every day) -- vitamins get taken sometime that morning<br><br>- "Send out agenda for XXX meeting" (recurs 6 AM the day before the meeting) -- the agenda gets started in the morning and finished by end of day<br><br>- "Continue DVD at 46:30" (single event, 6 AM Saturday morning) -- I told the kids we'd finish this DVD this weekend...<br><br>- "Time Card" (recurring event, 12 PM every other Friday) -- Time card gets submitted by EOD every other Friday<br><br><br>Here is a task that I try to keep in Column 2 almost all the time:<br><br>- "BP / headaches" -- This forces me to record my blood pressure and headache pain levels in my medical journal for review with my doctor at my next appointment. I keep it in Column 2 all the time, thus I check and record it several times a day. If I happen to be moving quickly through my list that day, and hit this item more than enough times, then I will say to myself "OK this is done for today" and create an Outlook reminder to re-enter it in Column 2 at 6 AM the next day.<br><br><br>Reminders and alarms can also be used for things that aren't quite so urgent. For example, here are some items that go into Column 1 (on the last page) when triggered:<br><br>- "Enter your action items from Meeting XXX" (recurring event, 6 AM the day after the meeting) -- I want to make sure I get my action items done, but they don't need to be done the very day after the meeting -- I usually have a week or more to get them done.<br><br>- "Set up quarterly meeting with XXX" (recurring event, 1st week of every quarter) -- Meeting is to be set up sometime for the first few weeks of the quarter, doesn't really matter exactly when. Obviously I haven't triggered this one yet, since SF has only been public for a few weeks, but I expect it to work just fine.</div>

<div class="content">You have prompted me to review this idea further!  Since the New Year I have been using a diary I can carry around with me (I wanted to be able to schedule things in my diary when on the move) and I find my phone (that syncs with outlook) really hard to use in this context (i.e. I can't see what is coming up and what else is scheduled around it).  <br><br>However using outlook for alarms would be a great idea for me, because when I am away from my home office my phone would sound the alert if synced. This would then prompt me to enter the item into my SF list.<br><br>When I used outlook at my calendar, I found all these sorts of entries cluttered up my view of what I have to do.<br><br>Do you enter them as tasks or as a diary entry I wonder?</div>

<div class="content">I have always entered them as tasks, but since my new phone sync's only with the calendar and not with tasks, I am considering changing to calendar notices, so I can get the reminders on my phone.  But I don't want to clutter up my calendar, either...<br><br>I'm also thinking of deleting all the Outlook reminders and putting them on my phone's alarm system instead.</div>
