<div class="content">A post detailing a text-file-only list system... seems like it could be adapted to any number of Mark's systems pretty easily.<br><br><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5743081/why-i-get-more-done-with-plain-text-to+do-lists" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/5743081/why-i-get-more-done-with-plain-text-to+do-lists</a></div>

<div class="content">While browsing Google Reader on my phone this morning, I marked that article for further reading and/or comments. I'll comment here instead. ;-)<br><br>(1) It appears to me this todo.txt CLI & Touch have a lot of common features with Andreas' AFAHK (AutoFocus AutoHotKey) scripts. AFAHK also used a simple text file to store the todo list.<br><br>(2) I'm now on toodledo.com, but I still maintain text based projects notes in text files. I used wiki markups in the text files for formatting and links between files. So I have flexibility of just using a text editor to edit the notes, or use  a wiki software for formatting and linked browsing. <br><br>(3) After reading that todotxt.com , I think I'll stick with #2 above.</div>

<div class="content">My digital SF/AF1 system have since moved from Toodledo.com (simple list) to Checkvist.com (outlining) to iRT Gtasks Outliner (outlining).<br><br>However, I'm still interested in this Android & Windows based todo.txt. Interested enough to recently purchase the opensource Android Todo.txt Touch for the princely USD2 to test further. <br><br>Anyone else have been using/playing SF/AF1 on Todo.txt?</div>
