<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>We do not hear much from you these days.  Before someone jumps on me, yes...I know you are retired and I certainly hope you are having wonderful, enjoyable, and restful days.  But I would love to hear if you are still testing DWM, or have decided it is in its final state, or whatever.<br><br>And no, Norman, I am not a stalker -- don't even go there.  I cannot believe I am the only one who is curious about what Mark may be working on....and if he is okay and loving retirement!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Why is this a joke, TK?  I really do not understand why one cannot ask a simple question of the man who runs this website and has contributed to so many time management systems that people use.  Please educate me why this is a joke.<br><br>-David</div>

I was just wondering if you would continue to work on time management systems or is the latest version your final gift to us all?

<div class="content">Coward,<br><br>The problem and opportunity with boards is that folks' personality and foibles become obvious and there is a written account of such things. On some, these are pointed out and discussed in order to help those who are willing to listen. Usually, they spin-out, threaten to leave, then when asked by "kinder" people, they magnanimously remain. The latter has happened here at least once.<br><br>On other boards, no one cares about this wonderful quality of the internet and co-sign each others' nonsense.<br><br>Coward, well-done, but you might have over-stepped the bounds of this place. More than a few people like yourself have helped me in the past.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>p.s. After a post like that, Mark might just show up and give a status report after all.</div>

<div class="content">David, I come here to exchange ideas and talk about time management systems.  As others have mentioned before, if you have a personal inquiry for Mark, become Facebook friends or email him, etc.  He's told us all he is retired, and not responded to similar threads like this you have started.  Since he has told us he is retired, I'm remaining under the impression he hasn't anything noteworthy to say or update us on until we hear otherwise.  This board becomes a joke when it turns into a board used to constantly query Mark's well-being or activities.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, TK.  I understand.  I really did not mean any harm to anyone.  I was just curious.  It is not a problem as, like avrum, I really am leaving too.  I have learned a lot from the many great people here.  And yes, Norman, I really am leaving.  It is not a "threat".  Certainly no one would care one way or another if I post here.  <br><br>Best wishes to all of the nice people here.  Goodbye....and sorry to have caused a problem.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I would like to see Mark emerge from retirement to tie up the loose ends of Autofocus and DWM.  The Autofocus landing page is very confusing, and AF4 is not clearly called out, given that it's possibly the most robust of the four versions.  Do away with AF2 and Reverse AF (AF3).  Leave AF1 and AF4 as two variations on a theme.<br><br>I was never thrilled with DWM too much, and it doesn't seem like it's fully baked.  I expected Mark to come back after the one month to validate if the system worked as he expected.<br><br>If Mark's going to ride off into retirement, better tidy up the shop first.  And maybe enlist some trusted site visitors to be moderators to manage spam.<br><br>BTW, where in the world is Andreas Hofmann? :-)</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Brian that the Autofocus landing page is confusing. And though I do not agree that DWM is not fully baked (it works well for me overall), I also got the impression we were "beta-testing" it and that Mark would revise append or dismiss based on our collective experience of using it. <br><br>And I agree with David that this forum is poorer without Mark's comments. One thing that Forum Coward did not mention is that (as far as I can recall) every time David has done a post like this, Mark has responded. So the system works!</div>

<div class="content">I would have thought that the nature of this thread would have put off any new people.  Rather leave threads that seem inappropriate unanswered. The best way to change behaviour is to ignore it - which is probably what Mark is doing right now.</div>

<div class="content">The things that happen when people take themselves too serious. I do think a lot of us secretly would like to know what Mark is up to time-management-system-wise and are quite grateful that one of the forum members is willing to ask on a regular basis.</div>

<div class="content">Ah, so the 46 day old twitter post was right: Anything that does not get regular attention will start to change for the worse.  <br><br>I didn't read stalking into David's posts.  I read a whole lot of concern for Mark's health and well-being and probably indirectly wondering if the system really worked well for him personally since "the regular attention" stuff wasn't really happening.  Not sure when that became a bad thing (ie. caring and concern).  <br><br>Perhaps this is just a social experiment to see if the forum degenerates to the lowest common denominator without direct moderation.</div>

<div class="content">David<br><br>I have noticed that you react quite strongly to criticism and that which you percieve as criticism.  I wonder if this reaction affects your relationship with people and tasks at work.  Could this be a part of your time management issues?  Please take this in the positive spirtit it is meant.<br><br>Let me make a wider point here.  The quest for the perfect time management system is largely pointless because we are looking for the solution in the wrong place.  When we fail to deliver I suggest that what's really going on is either:<br><br>- we have too much to do and have a problem asking for more time or saying no; or<br>- we are experiencing anxiety and engaging in avoidance by not engaging effectively with our work<br><br>Rather than look for the new system (an excellent avoidance activity) a more useful activity would be to get some coaching or counselling on the underlying problem.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-03-23 1:13</div>
<div class="content">Man of Kent, I wouldn't categorize the response he got to this post as criticism but rather as a personal attack. I don't understand why several of you feel called to lay into him when he didn't write anything unkind. In fact, as Jacqueline said, it was just the opposite. I'm just a shrink, but it seems to me that several posters had a hankering for a whipping boy and David fit the bill. I am more interested in that dynamic than in why David gets upset by being flamed for an innocuous post. But then that's probably just my hangup.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-03-23 4:00</div>
<div class="content">Mel - I find the constant questions as to whether Mark is OK quite rude.  He has retired; this for me explains why he doesn't post regularly.  I am grateful that he provides this site at his own expense and without the desire to sell something.  The questions may well be motivated by genuine concern, however for me the questions are impertinent because they imply Mark should be posting.  Further constantly asking someone of Mark's age if they are OK carries the implication that they are not perhaps due to illness which again seems rather insulting and is frankly none of our business.</div>
