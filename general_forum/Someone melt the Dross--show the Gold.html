<div class="content">Hi Bob,<br><br>As much as you, I really hate panning for gold.  However it is in sifting thorough the tons of "dross" that one really learns, I learned ;-)  So  I guess what I'm saying it that I appreciate others providing those tons of dross for me to sift through to find my own gold.  After all, I may not be looking for gold at all ... maybe what I'm looking for is diamonds.  'twould be a shame if someone removed those with the dross ;-)<br><br><off to churn out some dross for others to mine></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Panning for gold may be considered hard work by some but it can also be a relaxing pastime - nothing much else to think about other than what you're going to find this time - and wow - knowing that there can be diamonds among those pebbles as well as gold ..... well!  I have got so much inspiration from the various posts and really enjoy panning now - and guess what - I've found pearls as well as the diamonds and gold :-)<br><br>And I appreciate the fact that you've thrown a few of those my way Mike :-)</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Another thought from the Dross High Preistess.....<br>Mark, have you consider installing the google search on your website?  It might help to settle the Dross/Gold dilemma as this site's search engine is more frustrating than satisfactory......just a thought.....  If you decide "Yes", this post is definitely Gold!!!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content"><br>I suggested (and actually started) a wiki, but wasn't sure of the platform I'd chosen. I set it up as a Google Site, but am now thinking of moving it over to Wetpaint. Wetpaint has ads, but it seems a little more intuitive to add content for new users (and I wouldn't have to invite everyone). I was also kind of waiting for Mark's "new" version of AF to be released. I also wasn't sure anyone else would be interested in contributing to the wiki.<br><br>If anyone  _would_  be interested in working on an AF wiki, I could post the address so we can start in on it.<br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">Andreas has set up a new wiki here:<br><a href="http://wiki.autofocus.cc/" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.autofocus.cc/</a><br><br>I urge people with specific information about AF to add to it and help it grow.  New pages for each "FAQ" item would be good.  So would pages like "Notebooks," "Filing," "Electronic Options" and the like.<br><br>This will benefit those people looking for specific answers rather than the community support which is so helpful on the forum.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">re: Mark Forster's church comment.<br><br>This is too funny. In the USA, there is a retired athlete named Yogi Berra, who used to play that most American of sports: baseball. Regarding a restaurant in St. Louis, Yogi was quoted as saying, "Nobody goes there no more; it's too crowded!"<br><br>I'm sure it's all apocryphal.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe you have to be an introvert to understand someone can say<br>"Nobody (I know) goes there no more; it's too crowded!" ?<br>But it must be a joke in the US if as Laurie Helgoe says "Most Americans, whether introverted or extroverted, have learned to look like extroverts." And an all American (of the US) sportsman can only be an extrovert.</div>

<div class="content">> That reminds me of something once said to me about a church: "It gets so crowded during <br>> the services, it's not surprising nobody comes."<br><br>Heh. I heard this as a quote from the late, great Yogi Berra, in reference to some restaurant in Manhattan: "Nobody goes there any more, it's too crowded."<br></div>

And the first two posts, greenchutney and wil, and perhaps just a couple of others provided exactly the help I needed.<br><br>I guess I'll just ignore the rest as a form of quid pro quo so they can deal with my fascination (look up that root in latin or visit "a natural history of love"--and I'm not a fan of latin) to use my time wisely and to treat it importantly.  Some items like that should be guarded, lol.<br><br>Bob<br></div>

<div class="content">I always confuse 'quid pro quo' an exchange with 'qui pro quo' a confusion in some way a qui pro quo :). My guess is that it is intentional and that it started as a latinist joke.</div>

<div class="content">I don't know Bob, I used to feel like it seems you do when I was fully immersed in the "Cult of Productivity".  Not every book can be condensed to a Coles Notes summary version.  That's where things like Jim's wiki come into play.<br><br>Forums like this are made up of people.  People who have different personalities, different concerns, different circumstances.  What might be gold to you to solve your concerns may not even be worth speedreading through to me.   <br><br>Just like small talk may arise in regular conversations at work, it will come into forums like this as well, because it's a way of building a social community - not just get in, get the job done and go home.<br><br>There will always be the personal anecdotes, the tangents, and the humour too.  To me, that makes this forum not only informative but entertaining as well.  If I didn't want interaction, I'd read blog articles or a book on time management (unfortunately, I think I've read all of them...)  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Bob,<br><br>I think that's a pretty good strategy. Generally you get good responses in the first page or so.<br><br>These often spark a discussion which may or may not interest you and which may or may not have stuff which would be useful to you.  But if you've got what you need already,  that's fine. You've already done us the favour of seeding our discussion: it would be absurd to expect or pressure you to follow it through to the end.<br><br>As you say, time is precious. One day I might need that cure for cancer (or great novel or unified field theory or treatise on the best way to bake conkers) that you're developing.<br><br>Though THIS day, I need to do the washing up, so if you'll excuse me...<br><br>(I wonder whether Bob will read this.)</div>

<div class="content">This is such  extremely amusing  thread and perhaps explains the affection of many for this forum. I followed a link to one on the gtd site and the difference in atmosphere is remarkable - I didn't stay long! <br> <br> @ will - just sputtered tea on my iPhone laughing. <br><br>To misquote " what life is this so full of care...

<div class="content">Hi Will<br><br>I am very happy to tell you that I have a solution to your washing up need - unless of course it is a deep seated psychological need, arising out of an excess of guilt factors, ingrained from long periods of staring dolefully at those pots and pans .........<br><br>The solution is a new fangled device (what does fangled mean anyway??) called a dishwasher.  Care needs (should/ought) to be taken when selecting said dishwasher, as it can occasionally come accompanied by various psychological issues of it's own.  For further details there are numerous posts regarding my own dishwasher experiences, although I don't believe they were referenced under that heading in the FAQ's.  However I will be happy to elucidate - at great length of course - should you so wish ......<br><br>Markj - sorry hope you don't need to purchase a waterproof cover for your i-Phone :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>My beloved will confirm that the pot related sense of guilt I feel is entirely inadequate to the situation. (Though I do worry about the time spent staring dolefully or otherwise at the laptop.)<br><br>Mark,<br><br>It is frankly irresponsible of Christine to mention a problem like a tea-stained ipod and a solution like a dishwasher in the same reply. As anyone who has put their son's mobile phone in with the daily wash (and, let's be honest, who hasn't?) will attest, these miracles of modern engineering are not dishwasher safe. I hope it's not too late?<br><br>Though I remember my 3 year old daughter, having got marmalade all over my calculator, did carefully hand wash it with the rest of the dishes. It took a couple of days to dry out, but then was fine. So perhaps careful hand washing in warm water with plenty of detergent? Or perhaps things have moved on in the last quarter of a century (dear Lord, where did it go?) and it would be safer to accept the tea stains as part of the patina of life, and think of us fondly whenever you notice them.</div>

<div class="content">Will<br><br>I am so sorry to have inadvertently touched a nerve - perhaps there is a branch of "Doleful Laptop Users" in your area?  If I might offer a suggestion I would recommend using Yellow Pages to check as Google might exacerbate the problem ......<br><br>Mark<br><br>I do apologise for any implication of using the dishwasher to solve the "tea stained i-pod" issue - that was not my intention at all but - lo, I fear my irresponsibility is being overtaken by a serious case of frivolity - methinks I must depart, lest my frivolous presence offends ....!</div>

<div class="content">I'm sure Bob is over this thread, but I do think that productivity itself is dross in the big picture. It's cliche' but true that at the end of our days, people won't be talking about how many tasks we crossed off our AF lists but about what we did for others. I think that's what this forum is about. I know that I personally care less for how many tasks Mark gets done with his productivity approaches than that he spends time on this board connecting with all of us.</div>
