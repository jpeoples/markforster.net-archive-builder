<div class="content"><a href="http://gotreasurehunting.com/?p=1726" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://gotreasurehunting.com/?p=1726</a><br><br>A fine site, with a terrific idea: live life as a treasure hunt.  Basically it's the same idea as persuing goals, but the metaphor makes the idea more psychologically powerful.<br><br>The linked page is an article on why time management frequently doesn't work.  The start with the point that time is abstract, thus not something you can really manage.  If time were something you manage, then managing time might be like porcupines, to use the article's simile.  Unlike porcupines, you can't get more time, arrange time, or use time.<br><br>So using a calendar and a clock to divide time into pieces is doable, but rather artificial and not the only way to do things.  They propose thinking of other metaphors to think about time and your connection to it.  Perhaps time is a forest you travel through.  So instead of managing time, try exploring time (or speaking more conventionally, use your free time to explore things you can do, discover new things).<br><br>In the world of AutoFocus, much of life is governed by what you write on the list.  Do you try to do everything on the list?  Do you manage your list, or does it manage you?  Are you looking at what interesting things you can put on your list, that lead towards interesting things?  Is "Seek out the treasure" on that list?  (And would your treasure be material or ethereal?)</div>
