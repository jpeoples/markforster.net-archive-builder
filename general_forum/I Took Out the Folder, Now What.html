<div class="content">The year's medical receipts folder is sitting on the dining room table (which is still clear from Christmas dinner), waiting to become an insurance claim. I even sorted the contents by size, letterhead, and type of service. (Yes, size. Drugstore uses small printer, dentist and physio use big. Also, it's easier to clip pages of the same size together.)<br><br>It's been there for three days, and it's still just a folder of papers sorted by size and type.<br><br>Did I miss a step?</div>

<div class="content">But if I put it away now, the insurance company won't know to send us money. I think I'm missing a step.</div>

<div class="content">Then tell the insurance company?  I'm sorry, but isn't this obvious?</div>

<div class="content">Use my new instructions for SuperFocus which will have this sorted out for you in a trice.<br><br>Oh, wait... I haven't published them yet. They're sitting in a folder waiting to go.</div>

<div class="content">Do you have a sense of why you're resisting this task?  Is there information you need to gather?  Address for the insurance company, forms to fill out?  What if you write down EVERY POSSIBLE next step and see if you find something that will let you move the task along?<br><br>I definitely can sympathize... I'm AWFUL at paperwork.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, you are missing a step, maybe 2:<br><br>Submit 1 claim.<br><br>Re-enter on your list, indicating the deadline when all of them must be submitted.</div>

<div class="content">What are you doing?<br><br>What do you want?<br><br>Is what you are doing getting you what you want?<br><br>What could you do that might better get you what you want?<br><br>Try that instead, then repeat.</div>

<div class="content">I was poking fun at myself for hoping that just getting the folder out will somehow make all the rest of the steps happen with no further effort on my part. Sometimes a bit of dry humour helps me break past mental blocks.</div>

<div class="content">And you seem to have had the last laugh at yourself too! It was an interesting post Cricket, as were the comments in response.</div>

<div class="content">Was I the only one who recognised that you were being humorous?</div>

<div class="content">My first response assumed humour, but then I caved.</div>

<div class="content">All responses where in good intention.<br>I wouldn't feel upset by it :)</div>

<div class="content">I wasn't sure, but it rang true enough and goodness knows that *I* sometimes struggle with just what you were joking about, so... maybe someone else comes along and really is having a "now what" moment and one of our suggestions helps them figure out that next step, well, so much the better.</div>
