<div class="content">I want to set up some checklists and procedures for myself and my business. So for example I will set up a checklist of things to check before I send copy to a customer, and perhaps a checklist of things I want to do each morning or evening. Also a checklist for new enquiries from potential new customers.<br><br>Thing is I don't know where to keep them. I can obviously keep them in a binder on my desk - but does anyone have a better idea?  Also is there somewhere online I can keep them so I can access anytime even when away from home (I'm wondering perhaps something like evernote?)<br><br>Can anyone give me some suggestions of what works for them?</div>

<div class="content">I use OneNote for checklists quite happily. It does have webbased. There are multiple approaches:<br><br>1. A page with checkboxes that you click on/off<br>2. A section with pages you drag below the done line.<br>3. A section with pages you indent (making a subpages) to mean checked.<br>4. For systems, I created an outline:<br>Top level is the process steps.<br>Second level is (eg) customers. <br>I move the customer pages physically from one step to the next.<br>5. You can also do templates to have a standard page format.</div>

<div class="content">One note sounds like a good idea - and I will investigate it - however in an ideal world it would be good to have something I could sync with my iPhone I suppose?</div>

<div class="content">There is a native OneNote app for the iPhone, but I found it quite lacking. (Last time I checked, you couldn't search and you couldn't move pages around.) I found MobileNoter to be vastly more functional, albeit not free.</div>

<div class="content">Plain or rich text files in a Dropbox folder… <br><br>Simple and universal, has resisted the test of time and passing technologies.<br>(well, the dropbox part is more recent, but that just added the missing "accessible from anywhere")</div>

<div class="content">Alison:<br><br>Evernote would be excellent. You can access it on-line anywhere with virtually any device. You can also email the check-lists to your customers direct from your Evernote account but with their replies going to your normal email account.<br><br>I'm sure you can do a good job with OneNote too but it is more expensive and doesn't have as good synch ability.</div>

<div class="content">I use a spreadsheet program (Numbers for Mac) to design 2-5 short checklists for each day of the week. They all fit on one page. I print it out on full-sheet Post-It label paper on Sunday night and cut the appropriate strip from it each morning and stick it onto a daily C.A.N. page in my pocket notebook (CheckLists, Appointments, Notes). I have slightly different routines each day of the week, so this approach makes sense for me. <br><br>Checklists are really helpful for two reasons: (1) you avoid having to reenter all the mundane things in your to-do list; and (2) you can put important routine reminders in that will save you from frustrations. As an example of the latter, I have a checklist item to make sure my work badge is in my backpack. I usually keep it there, but occasionally leave it in my jacket pocket or bike bag. It's very frustrating to commute to work in the morning and not have your badge, but it's not the kind of thing I want to keep entering into my to-do list, since I rarely forget it. Having it on the checklist and getting in the habit of not leaving for work until the morning checklist is all ticked solves this problem.</div>

<div class="content">If you just want to keep things simple, try using google docs.  I keep a month end check list in there and just go down and bold each item as it is done.<br><br>At home, "Home Routines" for the iPad or iPhone is very handy.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Mark, Evernote, even though I have OneNote.<br><br>Checklist are good for many situations and as ubi and other say, keeping them in digital format means they only nhave to captured once, used as required and perhaps edited as circumstances permit.<br><br>Read 'The Checklist Manifesto' by Atul Gawande, extremely well-written even if many of the examples are from the world of medicine.  Inspirational.</div>

<div class="content">I'm liking the home routines app - and you can sync it to web and iPad. Just need to find some time to set it up properly.</div>

<div class="content">I use Ultimate To Do List on my smartphone, syncs with Toodledoo my my Toshiba notebook (Toodledo is an option I select in Outlook Tasks).<br><br>UTDL also has a notes tab for each task, so I'm starting to use this as a checklist which I store in the Routines folder.<br><br>Gawande's book acknowledges the origins of checklists (leaving the Ten Commandments aside for now) in aviation - the prototype of what became the four-engine B17 Flying Fortress crashed during testing and the finding was 'Too much airplane for one man to handle.'<br><br>Gawande then fast forwards to the Miracle on the Hudson crash landing of a couple of years ago, pointing out how the checklist not only helped in the situation after the birdstrike, but in creating the right environment for the flight team beforehand.<br><br>Our younger son heads up a pre/post- theatre recovery team, says they've been using checklists for quite a time now.<br><br>Gawande's two earlier books on medicine are equally readable, the man has so many diverse talents.</div>

<div class="content">Ellen Langer, experimental psychologist and author of books on mindfulness has an aviation story which she trots out to support her opposition to mindfulness. See the first page of this journal article:<br><br>https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:D8rW4-mjum8J:www.jcu.edu.au/business/public/groups/everyone/documents/journal_article/jcudev_012635.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESj9Z6C7iE42rdPvgPiOdNpKUq6psn0kyrHmWeOAPMlfHcNE2QStmgT_Wh1sf7lJRCwTiVJkqENjVkbwXsmEKQYB4d2WFI5Qq33PXgvEHq6IBPDIyCe-eDHO9GvlE9eD88ROpViy&sig=AHIEtbQy88n5fG-jCdw4THSc7fHcG06lxg</div>

<div class="content">There needs to be a balance. Yes, checklists and habits can be done mindlessly, but they can also support mindfulness.<br><br>One group of Orthodox Jews say 100 blessings a day. I'd actually call them Appreciations, but most of them begin with "Blessed art thou oh God". (Fine print: a bit of browsing around the internet when looking for something else doesn't make me an expert.) Routine events such as washing or eating account for half. Some of those make sense at the time (thank Him for water or food or health). I don't see a connection for others.<br><br>Yes, it's possible to race through the phrase without thinking about it (like my Catholic friends used to race through Grace), but if you take the time to think about the miracle of fresh, clean water -- its ability to clean us and sustain us, and the infrastructure to provide it, and the overall scarcity -- the act of washing becomes a reminder to be mindful and grateful. The trigger (or checklist) causes mindfulness.<br><br>Also, a checklist can free your mind. If your list takes care of remembering to pack PJs and toothbrush, your mind is free to think about sunscreen or extra mittens and what each person would like for snacks on the drive.<br><br>The checklist didn't cause the pilot to miss the de-icing step. His bad habit of reducing the step to "yes" did.</div>

<div class="content">For Mac, PDFpen allows you to edit PDF's, add images and signatures, and make interactive PDF's (with "checkable checkboxes for checklists").  It also allows you to merge, delete and re-order pages like Acrobat Pro.  There is also an iPad version, and is iCloud-ready.<br><br>These are the same people (<a href="http://smilesoftware.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://smilesoftware.com/</a> ) that make the popular TextExpander app.<br><br>I would guess that there's a Windows version out there that has similar features with interactive PDF's, etc.  (The PDF editing capability of this software is really slick.)</div>
