<div class="content">Stever Robbins has Action Days - <a href="http://www.steverrobbins.com/doitdays/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.steverrobbins.com/doitdays/</a><br>For Barbara Sher it's Success Teams - <a href="http://shersuccessteams.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://shersuccessteams.com</a><br><br>I'm looking to capture some of this accountability goodness, albeit with a twist: a twice daily check-in via email. It would work like this: <br><br>AM: Email documenting both planned i.e. appts & unplanned (free) time <br><br>PM: A brief  1-2 line overview of how we both did<br><br>This process is not dependent on any system or workflow. Rather, it's a habitual nudge towards honesty, self-reflection and support. <br><br>Anyone interested?</div>

<div class="content">I'd love this. It will be interesting to see how things go. Somewhere I have a link to a program that automates this sort of thing, for use in groups. Off to look.</div>

<div class="content">Found it. iDoneThis.com . Not my first choice because: Not free for the long term. Doesn't let us list our goals for the day first. However, not voting for it doesn't mean I wouldn't go along with the group. For now, though, email gives us the most flexibility.<br><br>To make email checking and filtering easier, I'd like to start the subject line with a code.<br><br>Would it be okay to combine today's report and the plan for tomorrow in one session? That works best for me these days. Given time zones, we'll all have different schedules.</div>
