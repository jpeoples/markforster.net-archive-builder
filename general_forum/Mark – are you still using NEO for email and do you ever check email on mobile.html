<div class="content">From: Troy<br><br>Long time lurker here. I've been flirting with trashing my digital task manager and going back to paper with FV, FVP or FFVP. The problem for me is always dealing with email or with digital content that I work with.<br><br>I've read some of Mark's posts on NEO Pro (eg: <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2400057#post2402468" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2400057#post2402468</a> ) and I became interested in this software ( https//www.emailorganizer.com/ ). Although it could use a UI bump, it seems very robust.<br><br>Mark (and others): I'm curious whether your practice is to only check email while at your computer and not on your mobile device(s). If so, this is an attractive proposition for developing my ability to focus on deep work and control my email habits, but a bit anxiety inducing for those times on the road when I want to know what is going on in my email.<br><br>I ask because your description of your use of the "Active" features NEO suggests that you keep all emails in your inbox. I understand that this is possible and you may forego the use of an "Archive" folder with the NEO overlay. However, I imagine that when/if you check your email on your mobile device there are hundreds of emails clogging your inbox view.<br><br>Do you use an archive folder? On your smart phone (if you ever check email on it), do you just rely on the read/unread filter to know if something is new? And if you do check your email on the smart phone, how to you proactively remove a non-actionable email on the fly from your active list for such time as you return to your computer?</div>

<div class="content">Troy:<br><br>1. I don't use NEO any longer, but only because I found the program kept seizing up. Probably because it's dealing with a huge amount of past email.   NEO indexes the Achive folder along with any active folders. With the much smaller volume of email I have at the moment I can cope perfectly well with Outlook on its own.<br><br>2. I only use my Smart Phone for previewing email while I'm away from my desk - I only answer an email on the Phone if it is really urgent. I delete all email from the Phone once I've read it. In order to do this, it's very important to make sure that the Phone is set NOT to delete email from the server so that it's still available for Outlook to download. I have Outlook on my computer set to delete email from the server once downloaded, so the Phone only downloads what I haven't already seen.</div>
