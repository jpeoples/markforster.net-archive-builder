<div class="content">What small helpers do you use? Must be really small (=not expansive, tiny, almost neglect-able...)  but bring you considerable help/satisfaction.<br><br>Can be software, tool, thing...anything.<br><br>My small helpers:<br>Apps (mac):<br><br>- Awareness app (warns be when I am too long working at computer) <a href="http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/</a><br>- Menubar Countdown (=timer)<br>- ClipMenu (=clipboard with history and keyboard shortcuts)<br><br>Tool:<br>- Good, smooth writing pen</div>

<div class="content">Daneb - <br><br>I'm a sucker for tools talk. Here's mine:<br><br>1. Circa journal and punch - I borrow, steal and pillage design ideas from Dave Seah and others, and then create my own productivity worksheets. <br><br>2. Micron Pen (O1)</div>

<div class="content">RE Awareness app.  I use something similar on Windows:  Wellnomics WorkPace.   <br><br><a href="http://www.wellnomics.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.wellnomics.com/</a><br><br>It's supposed to be an ergonomic awareness tool.  I configured it to force me to stop typing every few minutes, and to insist I take a short break every 30 minutes.   In addition to the ergo benefits, those little breaks help me assess if I am really working on the right things.   I use the 30-minute break to "stop mid-sentence" and get away.  Helps clear the mind as well as rest the body.  <br><br>It's a pretty small thing, but makes a big difference in helping me sustain focus on the right things.</div>

<div class="content">Use a physical pen and notebook for managing task list / focus / notes.   Basically I "work from my notebook".    I feel I have a lot more control and focus, than trying to manage things exclusively by electronic means.   The notebook is just more convenient, has almost zero friction/overhead, and has a lot more information density and flexibility than electronic device.</div>

<div class="content">The only things I am using are steno notebooks for time management and colored single sheets of paper. This way I know in a sea of white what my notes look like. The steno notebooks only contain action items no notes. I use them one at a time and when I reach the end I start a new one and write anything still to be done from the old book in the new book. I have tried to remain ultra simple   <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">From the title I thought this thread was about delegating tasks to your kids. Depending on the task, that can certainly be a useful approach to time management!<br><br>More seriously, my favorite little tools include:<br><br>5x8 legal pads<br>Excel for checklists and project planning<br>Cheap spiral notebooks<br>GTasks app on my phone: not for a whole task system, just a quick way to add day-specific tasks which I can later see while looking at my Google calendar.<br>Text files<br>A whiteboard</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this post. A little nudge to me to settle on a task environment. I'm just thinking of going back to pen and moleskine for tasks. However, for now:<br><br>Autohotkey for repetitive key sequences (email addresses, timestamps, etc)<br>Outlook for tasks, mail and calendar<br>OneNote for ... notes! (also the back of my moleskine)<br>Top Task List on my phone<br><br>All very obvious, so far. One thing I'd add would be my monocle. It's all very well having a list, but if your eyes have got to a certain age and you don't have your readinyou, having a monocle round your neck makes all the difference.<br><br>Will</div>
