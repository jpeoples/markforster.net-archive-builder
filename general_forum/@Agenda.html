<div class="content">I want to keep track of items to be discussed with a person when meeting him. In GTD I use @Agenda. What about AutoFocus?</div>

<div class="content">Borisoff,<br><br>That is outside of AF proper, as is a Tickler, Calendar, Contacts, etc.  AF4 is for To Do items ... and it also functions as a universal capture point, if you use it that way (i.e. put everything into it first.)<br><br>I would suggest that you either expand how much you write in the AF entry for the meeting; put it on your calendar; keep a separate agenda list, etc.  One thing you can do is keep your AF book from front to back and then have special lists from back to front ... i.e. put your ticklers and agendas and special projects lists from back to front.  That works for me.</div>

<div class="content">As far as I get the following is outside the AF then:<br><br>- Calendar<br>- Tickler<br>- Some action lists (someday-maybe, agenda, waiting for)<br><br>Where project list fits? I fell I can use AF for it...<br><br>So it's only for actionable items.</div>
