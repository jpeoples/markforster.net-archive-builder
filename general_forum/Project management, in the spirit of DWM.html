<div class="content">Here's some brutally simple project management, very much in the spirit of DWM.<br><br>From _Birth of the Chaordic Age_ by Dee W. Hock, p. 206:<br><br>"Swiftly, self-organization emerged.  An entire wall became a pinboard with every remaining day calendared across the top.  Someone grabbed an unwashed coffee cup and suspended it on a long piece of string pinned to the current date.  Every element of work to be done was listed on scraps of paper with the required completion date and name of the person who had accepted the work.  Anyone could revise the elements, adding tasks or revising dates, providing they coordinated with others affected.  Everyone, at any time, could see the picture emerge and evolve.  They could see how the whole depended on their work, and how their work was connected to every other part of the effort.  Groups constantly assembled in front of the board as need and inclination arose, discussing and deciding in continuous flow; then dissolving as needs were met.  As each task was completed, its scrap of paper would be removed.  Each day, the cup and string moved inexorably ahead.<br><br>"Every day, every scrap of paper that fell behind the grimy string would find an eager group of volunteers to undertake the work required to remove it.  To be able to get one's own work done and help another became a sought-after privilege.  Nor did anyone feel beggared by accepting help.  Such Herculean effort meant that at any time, anyone's task could fall behind and emerge on the wrong side of the string."</div>

<div class="content">Cool.  I want to do this at my office.<br><br>Is this fiction, hypothetical scenario, or a recounting of what actually happened somewhere?  And what happened before to make this take place?</div>

<div class="content">I can see the appeal of this, especially for most on this forum whom I suspect are mavericks in work and play.  Do not confuse a maverick with a rebel, I have a good diagram somewhere which made me feel good about being a maverick.<br><br>Many years ago, I went rogue in a large organisation and moved my multi-disciplnary team and myself into a large unused 'executive' office, I didn't ask anyone, just did it and moved the telephone numbers.  The project was the development of a sales and revenue (then about £1.2 billion) analysis and forecasting system.  We used a prototyping approach (do it, try it, fix it), there was enthusiasm, commitment, and liberal use of a whiteboard and flipcharts.<br><br>We had a self-imposed deadline and the outcome was very successful, a modern day descendant version is still in use with the same name.<br><br>But I would love to have had the coffee cup and string idea, maybe use it in my dotage some day?</div>

<div class="content">This is very like the Agile methodologies we use in software development (methodologies such as SCRUM and Extreme Programming).<br><br>The key simularities are<br>* Each task is written on a small piece of paper, post-it or card - keeps it simple and succinct<br>* Everything is displayed in public for all to see - promotes awareness and common purpose<br>* People comit to do what they can by writing their name on something - and everyone is expected to step up to the plate and do their bit<br>* What is yet to be done and what has been done is clearly visible for all to see - nobody gets to hide<br><br>I love the way it expresses the 'spirit' of the team as they help each other and take responsibility for the common goal -- this is one of the great joys of working in an Agile team.<br><br>Paul</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>This actually happened at Visa.  An early management team at Visa committed to the board that it would create an authorization system in a year.  It then hired a consultant who told them that the project couldn't be done.  The team members decided to do the project themselves anyway.  SPOILER ALERT:  the team succeeded.<br><br>-dp</div>
