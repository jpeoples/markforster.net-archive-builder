<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I've been experimenting with a new system that is made up of the bits I like from Mark's books and coaching/training sessions.  I've got a spreadsheed with the following headings:<br><br>Daily Tasks - for tasks I do everyday<br>Tasks Today - tasks collected yesterday<br>Tasks Tomorrow - tasks collected today<br>Projects (half an hour)<br>Projects (hour)<br>Projects (several hours)<br>Projects (little and often)<br>Projects (not started)<br>Areas<br><br>I'm using a day book to record meetings and any actions I take/think of.  I aim to do the following each day:<br><br>skim the lists, diary etc for anything urgent <br>tidy up workspace taking inboxes (and day book) back to zero by doing if I've time or listing if not<br>today's tasks - batch by context or location for efficiency<br>any tasks that arrive and I don't do I put on the list for tomorrow if they can wait<br>I can pick as I wish from the project lists if I have time for something more meaty<br>The projects (several hours) I have in order and try to work in that order, however I review later projects for anything that needs doing first and make another task or project<br><br>I'm using memotome.com and outlook to tickle future tasks.  Might use a task diary if volume increases.<br><br>I'm keeping it loose because I hate feeling boxed in by a system.  Will report back on how it goes.</div>
