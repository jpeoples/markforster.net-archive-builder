<div class="content">I've been thinking about mindmaps lately and mit's comment on another thread about finding them overwhelming.  <br><br>Mindmaps scare me.  <br><br>When someone (ie. me) who is easily overwhelmed sees the enormity of a project all in one huge unmotivating picture like a mindmap, it is paralyzing, not motivating.   I avoided my house renovations for over 4 years by seeing too much of the "whole job".  I tried breaking it down, did various mind maps, timelines etc. etc.  Tried dumping into the AF list too - and dismissing later.<br><br>The only thing that helped was to block out the whole picture entirely and focus 100% of my attention on one small piece of the big project as if the other pieces literally didn't exist.  <br><br>Even now, the surest way for me to feel anxiety again about getting my house renovated is to look at my original time-lines and monthly breakdowns of areas and things to do in those areas.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline, you may have already picked up my erlier post to TK in his thread Building Project Momentum, but I really find mind maps useful as a tool. I think a lot of it as with m,any things is the perspective and importance that you give it.<br><br>I try and make mine fun, particularly if they are for something daunting like a house renovation, draw little pictures etc alongside the items, but I use it as an overview and a starting point for the mini list of e.g. each room (a mini AF list if you like for that elelment) , so my regular focus is a manageable list for a discreet room or element of a room and I just refer back to my mind map when, say, I want to add in something new or show something as completed, or decide what to do next.<br><br>For me it works because as an overview it is NOT A BIG LIST it is a quick summary and very visual as opposed to a long documen with pages and pages of to-do's. I agree that would be truly soul destroying and stress inducing.<br><br>Have a great day<br><br>- Titch</div>

<div class="content">I use mindmaps a lot but agree they would be scary if one always had to view the whole of a map. The Freemind tool makes folding and unfolding nodes so simple that you only have to see the parts of the map you want to at any one time.  For several years I have been using Freemind to maintain notes on the tasks being done/to be done by my group at work, effectively constituting a "To-do tree". By unfolding only those branches of interest it is very easy to focus on a part of the tree of interest.<br><br>I've been trying AF for about 6 weeks now and I've found it very effective at making sure things actually get done, across the full spectrum of jobs I need to make progress on.  There has been some tension, however, between maintaining the AF list and my  to-do tree that provides a structured account of what is going on.  Just writing this message, however, has prompted me to explore more thoroughly the possibilities for applying the AF approach within the mindmap context, and I may have worked out how to do this. I'll explore a little more and may post again on this if it looks worthwhile.<br></div>

<div class="content">A mind map is no more nor less scary than a list.  If your list has just a few high level entries (like "Renovate Kitchen") it is not that scary.  If you put the 400 odd steps you'll need to do on that list then it will, no doubt, petrify you.  The same is true of mind maps.  They can be as high or low leveled as you like.  In most systems the branches below any level can be collapsed.  So you can control how much detail you see.  So your center node might be "Sell House".  Under that you might have the nodes "Renovate", "Find New House", etc.  Under "Renovate" you might have "Kitchen", "Bath", "Master Bedroom".  Under Kitchen you may have some large tasks and under those some more detail.  While you are focusing on the Kitchen you can keep the other areas collapsed.<br><br>It is quite easy to see just what you want to see and no more.<br><br>Mind maps don't scare me ... some of the people walking around without their meds do, though ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I have really enjoyed using MindMaps with AF and echo Titch's comments above.  As Mike and Richard say you do not have to look at all of the detail level on a map - I have posted two maps on Flickr - nothing revolutionery - but they show hopefully the flexibility of MindMapping.<br><br>However some people definitely prefer a structured linear approach, whereas otheres prefer a creative, freeform approach.  Some of us probably alternate between the two, depending on any number of variables.  MindMapping is a great tool for expressing lists visually and adding a degree of flair and origininality that is difficult with a linear list - they can therefore add "fun" and "creativity" .....</div>

<div class="content">I can see the usefulness in brainstorming options - I've made a "leisure tree" and it was useful to think up things to do with my leisure time and to determine interconnections - ie. what can I do that's physical, involves interaction with my friends, and can involve my dog too (find a cross country ski path that allows dogs and invite my friends to come along).<br><br>Otherwise, I'm sorry - but it seems like a procrastination tool to me.   Working on a renovation mind map does not equate to actually doing the project iteself.  I get a heck of a lot more done when I tend towards "ready-fire-aim" vs. "ready-aim-aim-aim..."  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>What works for one will not necessarily work for another - you and several others on the forum, are far far better than me at the structured approach.  I am quite happy with knowing what to do but always prefer to understand why.  However a lack of knowledge or understanding the why does not stop me from "just doing it" when necessary.  e.g. I know that black ink photocopies better, therefore know why forms sometimes specify completion in black.  However even if I did not know why I would generally complete a form if black ink if that was specified.<br><br>However I have more of a problem with the "how" and "when" aspect of a project or task and also have a need to "see" reasons for things.  I guess it comes down to the auditory, visual, kinaesthetic stuff.  For me MindMaps help me to "see" things more clearly.  I can understand how to some it may seem a procrastinator in that it would apparently serve no purpose.  For me it is a tool which enables me to (a) focus more clearly, (b) see how things link and (c) exercises creativity which increases my motivation.  <br><br>Someone who operates more from an auditory perspective prefers to be told how to do something - someone who operates from a a visual perspective prefers to be shown how to do it.  Neither is wrong - just different!</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>a basic Mind Map is actually nothing more and nothing less than a visual representation of a hierarchical outline list, that allows you to fold and unfold subnodes, which correspond to subprojects. If you do Mind Mapping on a computer, it is essential that you use software that allows you to fold and unfold branches, as has already been mentioned above. My experience has been that pretty much all Mind Map software does this, and many allow you to take a text outline, eg from Word and display it as a visual Mind Map. Of course if you prefer to just work with a text outliner then that is fine.<br><br>Either way, I think that for a large project some form of being able to fold up sub-projects is essential, so that you can focus on just the handful of tasks that are currently of interest, rather than the 400 in the whole project.</div>

<div class="content">Actually, a mind map is a bit more than a visual representation of a hierarchical list.  A mind map is not hierarchical at all.  It is a network.  One thing that throws some people off is that once you have mind mapped a chapter in a book, for example, you'll find that you have LOST the SEQUENTIAL flow that you would have captured with a Harvard outline.  What you get in return is a network which shows the relationship of ideas TO EACH OTHER, rather than in relationship to the order presented in the chapter.<br><br>I think it is important to understand those two basic features: it is visual, but it is also a nonlinear network of ideas related to each other.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I was interested in your above post and an earlier one of yours where you mentioned the relationship aspect.  Although I do use MindMaps to show relationships I tend to use them more as a straightforward visual representation.  Where the relationships shown by a MindMap are helpful I don't tend to do anything with that detail, other than to show it as a link.  I get the impression that you work a lot more with that aspect of MindMaps and wondered if you had any examples you could point us to to illustate that in more detail.  I'm assuming of course that you wouldn't want to post your maps on Flickr :-)</div>

<div class="content">Interesting...<br>After looking at the mindmap linked, I can't recall a single word other than contiguity, only because I thought it was an incorrect use of the word in the context - although I wasn't really sure what the context was either.  So much for mindmaps used as mnemonic devices.  <br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-04-4 2:09</div>
<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>I'll dig around and see what I have in computer files.  Much of my stuff is hand drawn.  Mostly they are maps of books I've read and integrations of several books on the same topic.<br><br>A few have to do with projects of mine and sometimes they have shown me that one project has influence on several others and that prompted me to change priority because it influenced other things.  A simple (and perhaps obvious) example might be a project to get more exercise.  This links to other things such as projects to lose weight, lower cholesterol, get in shape to climb Mt. Everest, etc.  And you can imagine that some of those affect each other as well.  Some of this is pretty obvious and does not need a mind map to show it, but it does illustrate how mind mapping would show relationships.<br><br><br>Jacqueline,<br><br>Realize that you are seeing a map of an unfamiliar subject not having had access to the raw material.  Is it any wonder that you don't find it mnemonic?  If you had drawn it you would have.  It would then be helpful to you because it captured what you thought important in a way that was meaningful to you.  There is nothing about mind mapping that makes it magic to those who are seeing it for the first time.<br><br>The second point is that like most other things there is art to it and various levels of skill applied to that art.  I have seen maps that I understood immediately and others that made little sense to me ... such as the one in the link above.  I did not get much from it either.<br><br>Finally, speaking for myself, I'm just providing some information ... not selling something.  If you are not interested in mind maps, I don't want to push the idea on you.</div>

<div class="content">I know Mike - it's kind of like a Mormon witnessing to Richard Dawkins.  :-)  <br><br>There's something about the messiness of all of the mindmaps I've seen linked on here, in Tony Buzan's work - as well as my own - that I find offputting.  I think they can work well for those who don't understand the subject very well.  Same thing with flowcharts - like others said before - why do you need a flowchart for something like AF which is so incredibly simple?  <br><br>I see some usefulness in project planning including mindmaps in certain circumstances, but for the majority of applications they appear to be of less value than diving in and just working.   Part of my reason for thinking this way is that I am only too prone to seeing a project as a whole with the interconnections and dependencies - other people need assistance in doing this.  I need to stop stepping back and looking at the whole and focus more on moving towards completion of one component of that whole.  <br><br>Overall, I'm afraid that I'm prejudiced because my fascination with over-planning in the past has led to non-execution.  I think it's common that people may feel that since they are working on the plan, they are working on the goal - like someone obsessed with updating their GTD NA's etc. and not realizing they are spending more time working on their system than they are doing the work.  <br><br>For myself - a minority of one on this thread - there is definitely an inverse relationship between volume of planning and output of execution.   You don't find that, and that's cool.  I'm not trying to convert you either, just putting it out there for people like me that it is possible to succeed without such tools.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>LOL ;-)  Nice metaphor.<br><br>Well, I did a flow chart of AF right out of the gate because I found the instructions too confusing.  In doing the flow chart I realized that I had some misunderstandings.  But I trashed the flow chart as soon as it was done ... IOW, as soon as it had served its purpose for me.<br><br>Yes, the main idea behind a mind map is to help you understand ... so it follows that they work best where you don't know the subject.  As to over planning, I hear you ;-)<br><br>As to messy, well yes again, it all depends on what you find visually attractive.  I blow hot and cold on the subject of computerized vs. hand drawn maps.  I'm not sure how I decide.  Most of my maps on books are hand drawn (thus my problem in posting any).<br><br>I agree with your comment about planning vs. execution.  It can be a real problem for me.  I don't think that the answer is to plan less, however.  I think it is to know how much planning is necessary and how much is procrastination.<br><br>I come from a computer background and so I have lived on the bleeding edge of this conflict for years.  I know the absolute necessity for detailed plans in this area but I also feel the need to just jump in and get dirty.  I have seen (at least in this area) the complete folly of just jumping in.  It is far too complex to know all possible consequences when you are in the middle of coding a subroutine.  Most code written by those who just jump in has to be trashed.  Or worse, people try to salvage it and the problems it creates live forever.  (Read "Microsoft" there ;-)<br><br>For me it is a balance of knowing that I don't have to lay out a plan to fix my car battery problem but I do need a plan before renovating the kitchen.  Well, not so much "knowing" it as "remembering" it ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I thought you'd like that one Mike.  :-)<br><br>I think I've come to a point where I can take a look at a whole picture (just in my mind), then kind of zeroing in on one small aspect of that big picture that I feel I understand and can do something about.  If I don't understand how to do it, I find out more about it from other people, youtube, books, wherever until I feel comfortable in diving in.  <br><br>For example, I find with setting up spreadsheets, I can have a basic idea in my mind of where I want to go, but it isn't until I sit down and start playing with it that better ways of working / linking show themselves.  That's when I realize I can sometimes skip whole steps that I would have originally thought I had to follow to get the result that I want.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>to respond to your April 3rd post, you are quite correct that a Mind Map can have a network structure with cross links between items deep down the branches. On the other hand a useful Mind Map is rarely a general network (it typically has a distinguished node at the centre which is the overall project goal) and most  proponents of Mind Mapping that I have come across encourage you to severely limit the cross links and largely maintain a hierarchical structure. In my experience, the cross links are primarily useful in a brainstorming session, whether on your own or in group. Even then its usually easiest to first set up the basic hierarchical branches and then think about adding cross links to represent other relationships.<br><br>Once you have all the ideas and need to develop a project plan and then time manage it, which is I think the primary topic of this forum, they can become obstructive, and indeed frightening, since in general its best to work on a large project one branch at a time, rather than dotting about all over the place. Of course this may force you to completely rethink the overall hierarchy. If your project is to renovate an empty house and your branches each represent a room, it would probably be crazy to have the wiring redone in each room independently, rather than having the electrician in to do the whole lot. You might thus want to create a hierarchy by type of activity rather than by room.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jaroslav<br><br>Thank you for your helpful post - that does coincide with what I have found and I realise that my use (or lack) of links has been because I hadn't quite known what to do with them "because" my maps are generally of the project type variety.  I can really see the benefits of links from Mike's explanations in other scenarios and even on my project maps have now been able to add links to see relationships more clearly.<br><br>The illustration you give of the electrical wiring is a good point - I find it hard sometimes when you do have those relationships and I think the only answer is to produce a separate map.<br><br>I was doing a map this week of my office filing and one particular form of filing in particular, which is in the form of plastic filing boxes kept in larger plastic containers in sets of three and in various colours.  I started with a central node of [Plastic Filing Boxes] and branches of Blue Purple and Orange which spread to the file contents.  Despite my love of planning I am also like Jacqueline in that I like to just get started so my plans do tend to evolve as I go along.  By the time I left the map the central node was [Study Storage] with a sub node of [Plastic Filing Boxes] leading to [Corner Cupboard] and [Left Cupboard].  the files are then listed but grouped within coloured boundaries so that I can instantly see whether they are in a blue, orange or purple container.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-04-7 11:54</div>
<div class="content">Jaroslav's post emphasises the general point that it is quicker to group one's tasks by type of action rather than by project. In the example he gives it is better to do the wiring for the entire house, rather than complete all the actions for one room at a time. In the same way it's economical in time to batch all your emails together (and the same with phone calls, paperwork, etc), rather than deal with them by project.<br><br>The implication of this for mind-maps is that once one has planned all one's projects hierarchically, you need to be able to extract the different types of actions so they can be batched non-hierarchically. This is easy to do with most mind-mapping programs by using filters.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-04-7 12:00</div>
<div class="content">Jaroslav,<br><br>There are different uses for mind maps, as you say.  When it comes to "understanding" something, then links need to be there if they need to be there.  I mean, one can't ignore information (linkages) just because it violates the rules of one's system of recording the information.  It would be like limiting the scope of a project because you ran out of room on the page to list steps!<br><br>The second use discussed is of laying out some kind of CREATED system ... such as a project.  In this case, the map needs to conform to the physical reality, not the internal logical connections.  For example, in the filing system Christine cited, they files are physical and can live on only one place which can be shown equally well on a Harvard Outline or mind map with no cross links.  However, if one wanted to show connections between the various files (such as those which have both tax consequences and are also organized by subsidiary company or something like that) then cross linking is necessary.  Cross linking, viewed another way, is like "tagging".  It is a way of noting that things have more than one meaning or use.<br><br>So what it comes down to is that one needs to show as much complexity as there really is, and that one needs to see.  As I indicated, my use of mind maps is for research.  When I read a book I don't just "read" it, I dissect it, pulling out the ideas and showing relationships between them, and other ideas I have in my own mental framework.  So my maps can become quite tangled.  BUT, while they would give anyone else a migraine, to me they illuminate things.  As I travel around the linkages I see things that cause me to question things and set me off in new directions.  And that is why I map in the first place.<br><br>I don't know if that clarifies anything ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>Thought you might find that amusing.  I have to say that is probably the funniest You Tube video I have ever seen - and I literally was laughing out loud!!  Managed to stay on my chair though :-)<br><br>No great revelation led me there - just a post from a friend on Facebook :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine - That was terrific! It goes up there with the post-it note and mentos/cola videos. Great - really great planning and execution.</div>
