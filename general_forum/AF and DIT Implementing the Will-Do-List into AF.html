<div class="content">Autofocus works like a blast for me when it comes to 'normal' tasks which could be done today, tomorrow or any other day. But every day I have some tasks that have to be done exactly on that day. Some of these have lingered on my todo-list for days or weeks, feeding on my procrastination, but now they have to be dealt with. ;-)<br><br>Every morning I view all the open tasks on my autofocus-list and transfer the tasks, that have to be done today, on a closed will-do-list for today. This small list contains only the few tasks that really have to happen today.<br><br>When it comes to doing something, I first look on my will-do-list. If I find nothing there that fits my current time window I switch to my normal autofocus-list. This makes sure that I miss no urgent tasks on page 8 or 9 while I work on the tasks on page 2 or 3. <br><br>Combining these two methods makes AF the time management system I ever used to manage my daily workload.<br><br>Richard Norden, Germany</div>

<div class="content">I agree Richard!<br><br>there are a number of posts about how to manage same-day urgent items, how to keep track of major tasks with due dates looming and using the calendar for date-specific items whilst working with AF - it seems different solutions work for different people and different work demands. <br><br>I end up doing much the same as you - my list for the day includes must-do-today items incl preparing for today's/ tomorrow's meetings, and dealing with yesterday's emails. Then if there's 'spare' time, I work off the AF list. I also have a list of key tasks due this week/next week to help keep my focus on those in case having them in AF hasn't got a result in time (although it increasingly is helping with this!).   <br><br>The total effect is that I feel more up to date and in control, with less stress, than I can ever remember in my working life!</div>
