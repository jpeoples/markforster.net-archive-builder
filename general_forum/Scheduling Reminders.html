<div class="content">Not a new topic, but it's something I'm starting to use more.  I've got things I don't want to do now, and I don't want to forget, but I want to revisit in a couple days, or on a certain future date.  So I put it into a tickler for a specified date and out of my list.</div>

<div class="content">I really, REALLY wish Outlook would let you specify a start date on a task without having to specify a due date. Luckily, you can set reminders without having to specify any dates at all.</div>

<div class="content">I'm really interested to hear what people do for this - what I call timely or critical reminders of when you've decided something is appropriate to start on or follow up.  With DIT I could defer tasks to tomorrow.  With a task diary I could defer them to whenever.  With Outlook I can defer to any date but I have to write it into outlook and then write it back on my task list - not too bad but double entry - I guess my biggest thing here is I have a bad habit of ignoring Outlook reminders although I am trying to retrain myself here.  That's because SF doesn't have a system for future reminders.  Also in all the systems I find the need to be remind later today to add something to Column 2 as an "urgent" action that is not appropriate to put there in the morning.  I don't particularly like relying on outlook to do this either since I might not be at my desk when this comes through but my SF list is generally with me.  Thanks for starting the thread Alan - it's particularly relevent to me right now.</div>

<div class="content">I use an iPhone app called Due (by Phocus LLP). Reminders with an alarm, by date and time, recurring or one-time, they can be snoozed or moved to another day, etc.  It's very thorough.  Some reminders I take care of immediately when they come due, some I write on my task list.<br><br>For instance every morning a reminder comes up to check my calendar for the next 7 days - I do that when I get it.  But I have one set for several weeks from now to open a particular spreadsheet and start a process that I run each quarter - I'll put that on my AF list when it comes up (at 9am on Dec 5).  Also, that spreadsheet has a separate task list in it that will not go into my AF list as individual tasks - I'll just enter the title of the project, and I'll use Due for the few tasks that are time-sensitive.</div>

<div class="content">iOS 5.0 has a new app called Reminders. It's pretty basic, but I've been using it a lot already. All it is is a single todo type of list and you can set it to remind you at a certain time/date. You can make them recurring. That's it. One nice extra feature is it also keeps a running log of what you completed on which dates.</div>

<div class="content">What I do is quite simple: the first half of my notebook is used as task diary for  scheduling reminders and for urgent work and the second half as AF4 list. Stuff that is outside of the time frame of my notebook either goes into my calendar or one of my someday lists.</div>

<div class="content">I have a calendar in my ical that is just for AF reminders. Some are recurring (invoicing the publisher I freelance for, backing up all my blogs locally, various household tasks that need to happen biweekly or monthly) and others are single use. I have an Automator action that lets me create events without ever opening ical (or touching the mouse) so it's really quick to enter them.<br><br>I'd be happy to share the automator action for any mac users who are interested. Alternatively, there's a quicksilver plugin for GCal that you could use to accomplish the same thing.</div>

<div class="content">Mr. Forster has said on a couple of occasions that you should use a calendar when it's appropriate. (I'm too lazy this morning to post the references. I apologize.) I would think that includes setting future reminders to... er... remind you about something. All you need to do is find a way to remind yourself that you won't ignore. If you pay attention to Outlook, use Outlook. If you pay attention to email, use a time-delayed email. If you pay attention to your significant other, ... ... ... never mind.</div>

<div class="content">AbAlarm 2012 is quite a useful little alarm, which is much quicker to set than Outlook. It's free, though you are encouraged to give a donation.<br><br><a href="http://www.abelssoft.net/abalarm.php" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.abelssoft.net/abalarm.php</a></div>

<div class="content">I have a couple different ways to remind myself to start or do something at a later date.<br><br>followup.cc - I forward an email to (for example) Oct25@followup.cc and it will email it back to me on that date<br><br>hassleme.co.uk - Receive emails semi-random intervals reminding you to do something.<br><br>calendar.yahoo.com - using the repeating reminders<br><br>Which one I use depends on the to do item and how much control I want over repetition and editing the item.</div>

<div class="content"><< AbAlarm 2012 is quite a useful little alarm >><br><br>Mark - maybe you could have a "Software I Recommend" page, like your "Books I Recommend" page.  You always have really good SW recommendations.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Well, apart from AbAlarm the only two programs I really recommend are Evernote and Nelson Email Organizer.<br><br>And I really must bring the books page up-to-date...</div>

<div class="content"><<I use an iPhone app called Due (by Phocus LLP).>><br><br>I second the recommendation for Due for those who have an iPhone. It's extremely easy to set a reminder for whenever you wish with almost zero overhead.  It also is very flexible about how it reminds you, snoozing, etc.  It's become my most used downloaded app.</div>

<div class="content">I don't find software necessary. A plain calendar is 99% of the timed reminders I need. Rarely, a timed alarm is handy, but then just a time suffices.</div>

Thanks, Zane, for passing that along.</div>

<div class="content">I've just downloaded Due - it looks really brilliant. I'm going to put all my household tasks on there (aka flylady).<br><br>Also great for those work tasks were I have asked someone to do something and I can pop in a reminder to see if it has been done - I'm terrible for forgetting to follow up! I've tried putting it into my diary, but for some reason I just ignore them sometimes!</div>
