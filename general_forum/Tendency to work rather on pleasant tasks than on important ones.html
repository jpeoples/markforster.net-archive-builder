<div class="content">Looking back on my last days, I've accomplished a lot with the AF system – however, I have got the impression that I rather did a lot of pleasant things instead of things that would have brought me forward in direction on my goals. "Important" things, as we usually say.<br><br>On the other hand: Is this maybe not a bug, but a feature? The reason I'm not sure is that I have finished a rather demanding and big project recently (finished my latest novel, to be precise), so maybe my intuition longs for recreation, for a period of light and funny playing around instead of instantly attacking the next big thing. <br><br>I'd be interested in the experiences of others - and maybe in some comments by the master himself ;-) on this phenomenon.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>I suspect you've hit the nail on the head when you say "maybe my intuition longs for recreation, for a period of light and funny playing around instead of instantly attacking the next big thing."  One of the interesting things for me has been to see how the system starts to to balance everything.  It is strange to start with, because the concept of doing "what we feel like" can be quite alien, and we feel almost guilty for starting to enjoy what we are doing so much more.<br><br>I found that I cleared a lot of small and seemingly insignificant items to start with, but realised that they actually had more of an impact on either my mood or other larger tasks that I would have thought.  I'm certainly convinced that is a feature rather than a bug ......:-)<br></div>

<div class="content">I'm still fairly new to using AF but I imagine that confronting the difficult, stuck tasks when they are the list items on a page will force you to take action? MF says that if you still resist the task, then rephrase the task or break it down into smaller, more achievable tasks.<br><br>I think it is a good idea to regularly add fun things to the list..... movies to watch,<br>things to do, a restaurant to try and so on.<br><br>Congratulations on completing your novel. That sounds like a HUGE goal.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your comments and your encouragement. To clarify things I'd like to mention that I finished my novel BEFORE I came across the AF system. In the last weeks, I did nothing else than eating, sleeping and writing (not necessarily in this order), so there was no need for any task management system anyway ;-)<br><br>The story behind my initial question goes like this: Yesterday evening, I skimmed my AF lists and found that I had missed a task that I considered important and time-critical: I had the intention to write an old friend of mine a letter to his birthday a few days ago. It was on my list, but I (a) missed to put it on my calendar, as time-critical and (b) prefered to do something else when I had the choice.<br><br>Conventional thinking would say: OK, you're a beginner in AF, you still have to learn to handle time-critical tasks. Or maybe AF is not THAT universal system you have been thinking, you still need to apply common sense, and lots of it.<br><br>All this being more or less true, I am thinking whether there might be a second layer of answers. Why wasn't I feeling like writing him in the first place, for example? Maybe I am hiding from myself that our relation is not really that important anymore? Waqs it that my subconscious, my intuition had - by me using AF - the chance to hint me towards that insight? I will have to reconsider what happened, that much is sure. <br><br>Apart from this specific incident, however, I am still asking myself whether AF leads towards postponing unpleasant tasks or not. I once read the recommendantion that one should consciously choose one unpleasant task per day and do it first or second to have it done: What about that? To be able to consciously choose an unpleasant task, you have to mark them or have a separate list of "I don't want to but I have to"-tasks, which is prioritizing through the backdoor...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>You are correct in that there could have been a reason that you had "chosen" not to do the task but it is important to remember that you are new to the system and it could just as easily have been that you had not yet got used to the scan and review aspect.  If that task was on Page 1 and you did not get back to Page 1 until it was too late then that could be the reason.  If on the other hand you had reviewed your lists consistently and the item had not stood out then you are correct that AF could be indicating something else.  It may not be that your subconscious was pointing out that the relationship was not important but conversely that it is an important relationship to you and "missing" that date could be the trigger to re-establishing contact.<br><br>I really would not recommend the "do one unpleasant task a day" option.  Apart from the fact that that is adding an element of grading of tasks, you will be surprised at how many tasks which you would initially have considered to be "unpleasant" reach the point where they "stand out" and the doing becomes almost (and often actually) enjoyable.  It is the very way in which AF deals with those "unpleasant" tasks that enables them either to be done easily, reassessed or dismissed - but dismissed consciously in full knowledge of the reasons.<br><br>Stick with the instructions without grading for a while longer and see how you go  ...............</div>

<div class="content">Andreas, if the item is one of the last things on the page - those always end up being my tasks I've avoided - I will tell myself "suck it up princess", you're not dismissing it and you *said* you wanted to do it, so just get the darn thing done.  OR put your imagination to work for a bit to figure out how to get it done so it's not maybe exactly as written (eg. email or call your friend, send flowers instead).  Of course, if they really aren't that important to you, you would just dismiss it.<br><br>I used to work with a system where I laid out a task every morning that I really didn't want to do and I had to do it first thing.   I have to admit that this "eat the frog" concept really did work.  It also gave me a feeling of accomplishment all day although after awhile I ran out of things to list that I was afraid of doing.<br><br>I have found that putting some of these deadline-driven tasks into the AF system FAR before their deadline ensures that they will come to be one of the last tasks on the page prior to their deadline.  For example, in mid-January, I put the task on my list to write my father - my guess is that it will come around to being the last task on that page sometime in mid-March, just in time for his birthday on April 1.  Am I avoiding it because we're not very close?  You bet I am.  But we're not 'not close' to the extent that I'm not going to spend 15 minutes on something that will make him happy though.<br><br>One  of the tasks remaining on my first active page is to dispose of my mother's dress coat - the last thing I have of hers besides a 1950's red lipstick.  She died over 20 years ago and I've had it hanging in a closet ever since.  When it comes down to being the last item on the page, I may end up dismissing it because it does hold an emotional attachment, I just don't know at this point.  I'm hoping that I'll be able to let it go knowing that my extremely practical mother would have wanted it that way.  I think I'll keep the lipstick though.  :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br>Back to your original post - I agree with Charles, if you've put challenging and unchallenging (vs. pleasant and unpleasant) tasks on your list, once you've weeded through the unchallenging ones (because you felt like having a break), won't you eventually be pulled back into confronting challenging tasks?<br>I basically dumped my goal-oriented tasks onto the AF list and left out a lot of fun stuff that some people have on their lists.  I did include fun stuff that was related to doing something that was out of the norm that I really want to try / do again and wasn't getting around to doing in the normal course of life because it wasn't part of my normal leisure routine.  So they still have some element of challenge to it - it's amazing how often I put off doing those things, even though I know I'll be happier for doing them.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Just a comment on AndreasE's post about doing pleasant things rather than important things.  I had sort of the opposite experience.  I just started AF last week, and I found these  4 or 5 tricky tasks sitting on my first page that I had been procrastinating on for months.  My gut told me just to finish them, but they were not pleasant tasks, but what a great feeling once they were done.  I was also afraid if I didn't finish them I'd get bogged down on not be able to move on to some time sensitive stuff over on page 4. Actually, now that I think of it, it kind of prioritized for me, and it did it really well. <br><br>By the way, here are my observations and recommendations so far. <br>1.  I like its completeness: The system allows you to capture everything in your world in a simple and trustworthy way.  Nothing will fall through the cracks - just keep adding it. <br>2.  It also allows intelligent.  The system allows you to make the right decision on each item with the right amount of reflection, intuition and, if I may add, conscience.  It's a smart way to work and is obviously much more than a to do list. <br>3.  It is a miracle worker with regards to overcoming procrastination - it really gets you started like nothing else I have ever seen.  I have never been more productive after using this system.   <br>4.  One  observation:  It really helped me as I began this system to have a clear understanding of what a task actually is.  If a task on my list is too big or too vague it I got bogged down in it.  A distinction between a goal, a project and a task might help. Goals and projects probably require a different medium, which is fine because you can always transfer the details to the AF list.  For me, I think an AF  task has to have some physical boundaries with a concrete result -- make a phone call, type up a report, something like that.  GTD has some good thoughts on this point. <br><br>I would add only this:  Thank you, Mark, for a great contribution to time management.  This has been the best system I've used so far. <br><br>Paul from Canada.</div>

<div class="content">It's funny how we assume that most pleasant tasks aren't important. Pleasant tasks rejuvenate us so we can tackle the less pleasant ones. The biggest advantage of AF for me hasn't been increased productivity (though that aspect is certainly wonderful); it's been that I relax and even procrastinate in a positive way. Where I would once do mindless things that drained my energy and ultimately made me feel miserable (look through a catalog, surf the web forever), I now am reading and researching and enjoying my hobbies. We WILL take time to do restorative things. The question is, will we do quality things that add to our lives or not? We cannot work 24/7. One of the biggest reasons I procrastinated in the past was feeling I didn't have enough free time. Using AF gives me a feeling of luxuriating in recreational activities. I no longer feel guilty when I do them! I recommend letting go of the idea that doing pleasant activities isn't a good thing. It's very good indeed! Eventually, you'll be left with more challenging activities on a page and you'll do them because you've thoroughly enjoyed yourself on the way to them.</div>

<div class="content">I thought reading through this thread that it happened - could I say often - that an "unpleasant" task appeared eventually a pleasant one (accomplishment feeling), as some a priori pleasant ones did not appear sous grateful when completed. Don't know exactly why, I guess it's always a huge reward to do something that was complicate/complex/huge/... whic leads to a feeling of "proundess" <br></div>

<div class="content">I agree, Pascal. "Pleasantness" changes constantly. I can be in the middle of a normally unpleasant task "clean out basement storage room" and for some reason nothing else sounds as pleasant as continuing my work. That's why AF is such a great approach as it accommodates this ever-fluctuating sense of pleasantness.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>If you do feel able to let the coat go one thing you could do is take a photo of it, and/or keep a piece of the material.  You could use the material in a scrapbook page, perhaps with a photo of your mother wearing it, or if you don't do scrapbooks, just turn it into a small collage with a couple of photos and sentimental items, frame it, and hang it on the wall of your motorhome!</div>
