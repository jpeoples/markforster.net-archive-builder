<div class="content">Scott Young muses on the tradeoffs between "quality" and what he's calling "smoothness", by which he seems to mean ease of getting started.<br><br>Here's a quote:<br><< It’s the difference between showing up to the gym, doing a workout that isn’t optimized for fitness and doesn’t push you very much, versus the intense workout you really should be doing. If the choice is between the two workouts, the intense one will benefit you more.<br>But that’s rarely the decision. The decision isn’t between the efficient method and the inefficient one. It’s between the inefficient one and nothing. >><br><br>Full article at <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/02/06/lower-efficiency-to-go-faster/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/02/06/lower-efficiency-to-go-faster/</a><br><br>Any thoughts?  What do you think of the way he is framing the tradeoff?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>Mark has been teaching this principle for eons.  It's one of the foundational principles of little and often. It speaks directly to his advice about breaking a task down so that it's DOABLE to start.  The same principle can apply to completion of certain work.  I actively apply this principle of "good enough" and "soon enough" to busyness stuff.  One of my extreme examples is when I have a challenging job or day, I peek at my inboxes to check that there is nothing more important than what I already planned.  My fake deadlines also help me with maintaining ongoing responsibilities.  I know that on that day, that category will be done enough to keep up my basic standards and preserve my reputation.  If's far easier for me to say "I'll get it done by X to meet X standards.  If I complete my MITS, I can always go back and do more.....if I think it's actually worth the time and bother.  LOL!   Read Mark's Get Everything Done and Do It Tomorrow to refresh you recollection of his wonderful gems!  He brilliantly teaches the over-riding principles with examples and advice.  He also encourages us to find what works best for us.  Mark's principles and many of his tips are really quite genius.  He freely states that many of his principles are age old. The magic is how he offers a different perspective of how to use it to your benefit without all the insufferable linear driven dictates. Thanks, Mark!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>If you don't have copies of either of his two books, roam around in his archives.  It's actually quite fascinating how he discusses certain principles and certain methods in various contexts and various perspectives.  Ponder  the metamorphosis of his AF series so see how he's much like a natural scientist or cook.  I always thought that there are only X amount of permutations to be had with the same basic principles: systems, tips, rules, etc.  Mark's wizardry knows no bounds. His cleverness helps so many people because he offers different perspectives, rules, systems and tricks.  He can't wave a wand to make resistance go away, yet he teaches us many ways to diminish it enough to start, continue and get the job done.  The second haft of his first book's title says it all....and Still Have Time to Play!</div>
