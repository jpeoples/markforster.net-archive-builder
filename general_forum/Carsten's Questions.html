<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-18 3:26</div>
<div class="content">In the blog comments, Carsten asked me some questions:<br><br><<< How did you for example simplify and streamline email processing? >>><br><br>I took Mark Forster's advice and gave NEO a try ( <a href="http://www.caelo.com/products/index.php#neopro" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.caelo.com/products/index.php#neopro</a> ).   It's an Outlook add-on.  It took some time to get used to it, and I almost gave up.  But it has so many nice features for automatically organizing your email.  The website explains it much better than I could.  The thing I like most is how FAST the search capability works -- much faster than Outlook 2007's native search capabilities.   If I need to take action on an email, it's very easy to write "NEO" in my SF list, with two or three key words, and maybe the name of the person who sent the email, and more description of the actual task, if needed.   I then tag the email in NEO with a "to do" flag and archive it away.   (No need to sort any emails into folders -- kind of like Gmail Archive in that respect.)   If the SF task ever stands out, it takes just a few seconds to locate the relevant email.<br><br>For personal email, I use Gmail, and it works pretty much the same way.  In SF I write "Gmail" or *G, and a few keywords, then add a star to the email and archive it. <br><br>For project-related emails, I update my project files as needed, and then archive the email.  If an email triggers a time-consuming update to my project files, then I use the NEO process described above, and in SF write something like "update project XXX" together with the email info.<br><br>For emails that need discussion at a future meeting (e.g., a 1:1 meeting with my manager; or a project team meeting), I add a "to do" to the email, then add a label or category to the email indicating the appropriate meeting, and archive it.  When it's time for that meeting, it's very easy in NEO to show only the "to do" emails for a particular category.<br><br><br>You also asked about (2) and (4)...<br><br><<< (2) Automate meeting agendas >>><br><br>I created a standing agenda for each of the meetings that I run.  They are very simple.  (1) Review open action items and our current deliverables, (2) Review hot issues, (3) Any other regularly structured business, such as going through the Change Request queue, (4) Opens - any new issues that team members want to discuss.   <br><br>This agenda is always the same.  <br><br>Action items carry over from meeting to meeting, and I update the status during the meeting, and add new ones immediately after the meeting.  This is the most time-consuming part of managing the project team.<br><br>Reviewing hot issues is easy.  Usually the list carries over from meeting to meeting.  Issues drop as they are resolved.  New issues come up in the "Opens" of the previous meeting if not immediately resolved.  New issues also arise via email, which are easy to find during the meeting, or just before the meeting (using NEO as described above).  <br><br>Sometimes, especially more tactical meetings, we also "go around the room" and everyone gets a chance to raise whatever issues they have.  This increases participation, brings out the real issues, and makes it really easy for me since I don't need a pre-prepared list of issues to discuss.  :-)<br><br>This is pretty basic stuff, I know, but for me it's been great!!   I usually try to prep before the meeting -- list and prioritize the "Hot Issues", mainly.  And updated the action items takes some work after each meeting.   But I keep finding ways to whittle it down and automate it as much as possible.   <br><br>Some program managers I know don't do any updating at all -- they just keep an Excel file on a share drive, and let everyone add their own hot issues there, and then they go through them at the meeting.  Action items are kept on a different tab.  I've toyed with moving to this approach because I really want things as automated as possible.  The only problem with this approach is some team members don't want to deal with the overhead, and as the team facilitator it's my job to make sure all that gets taken care of.<br><br><br><<< (4) Move *all* my own tasks to SuperFocus, and keep all my project-management work in appropriate files outside of SuperFocus. >>><br><br>A question appears on the forum from time to time -- "Do I put ALL my project tasks in SF, or do I just write the project name in SF and keep the project tasks somewhere else?"    It's come up a dozen times I'd guess.   <br><br>Back in the AF days I tried doing my project planning in my AF list.   I'd brainstorm everything I needed to do -- now or in the future -- with my project.   I'd write everything on the AF list.<br><br>That didn't work at all.  Most of the things on the list couldn't even be actioned now, since they were dependent on other tasks that had to be done first.<br><br>Then I tried keeping all the tasks in a separate project file, and in my list I'd write "Project XXX".   But that didn't work either.   "Project XXX" was just too big and too vague and it would never "stand out".  There was nothing to get me energized to take action.   <br><br>Then I started writing "Project XXX" but I'd also write a few key tasks that I knew were "important".   That was a little better.   The "Project XXX" task prompted me to review the project plan, update the files, communicate with team members, add new project-related tasks into SF, etc.   And the "important" tasks that I'd entered also got me to take action, since I could see exactly what needed to be done, I could see the deadline, etc.   But there was still always some anxiety or vagueness about this process and it didn't really work as well as I'd like it to.<br><br>Finally I decided to enter ALL my action items associated with the project into SF -- all the action items that could actually be actioned NOW, that is.  I also entered any planning or project maintenance tasks, such as "prepare agenda for XXX meeting", "check status for Project XXX schedule", etc.   <br><br>This time, it's working really well.  I feel pretty confident that all the actionable tasks I really need to be sorting and sifting are actually in SF -- ALL of them -- not some in SF, and some still buried in my project files.   This has increased the clarity by a huge degree -- I'm still not exactly sure why.  :-)<br><br>It's also increased my level of trust in the SF system.   I know everything is there, in my list.  Part of my project maintenance is to make SURE it's all there, in my list.   And now that I've developed this habit, it just happens automatically:  if it's actionable, now, then it goes into my list.  <br><br>Funny thing, it also has helped that I don't try to file any project emails into Outlook folders.  I used to try that, and I'd have a task in SF that said "do odds and ends for Project XXX (see Outlook folder)".   That big, vague task never "stood out".   But now, with NEO, if the email has a task associated with it, I enter the task directly into SF and then archive the email and don't even file the emails in project folders.   I don't try to connect everything with a project anymore.   If I really need to make that connection (how often does that REALLY happen?), NEO's search capabilities allow me to find the relevant emails.  <br><br>I thought adding all these tasks to SF would be too much overhead, but it's turned out to be really easy and fast and makes the system much more reliable overall.<br><br><br>OK, I've been rambling far too long, I'd better stop.  Let me know if any of this is helpful!</div>

<div class="content">Dear Seraphim,<br><br>Thank you very much for your detailed answer. No doubt it will be helpful for me! Unfortunately I don't have the time to read it carefully at the moment. I will come back later and let you know if there are any points left open.<br><br>Thank you for your efforts again!<br><br>BR<br>Carsten</div>

<div class="content">""Do I put ALL my project tasks in SF, or do I just write the project name in SF and keep the project tasks somewhere else?" <br><br>S1 : everything :<br>Back in the AF days I tried doing my project planning in my AF list.

"Project XXX" was just too big and too vague and it would never "stand out". There was nothing to get me energized to take action. <br><br>- I did it too but it blocked me too. I was un able to advance on my work and lose one day with this. <br><br>S3 Project X + MIT<br>Then I started writing "Project XXX" but I'd also write a few key tasks that I knew were "important". That was a little better. The "Project XXX" task prompted me to review the project plan, update the files, communicate with team members, add new project-related tasks into SF, etc. And the "important" tasks that I'd entered also got me to take action, since I could see exactly what needed to be done, I could see the deadline, etc. But there was still always some anxiety or vagueness about this process and it didn't really work as well as I'd like it to.<br><br>- Yes I also tried that ! same conclusion I could not trust the system.<br><br>S4.

I feel pretty confident that all the actionable tasks I really need to be sorting and sifting are actually in SF -- ALL of them -- not some in SF.<br>I enter the task directly into SF and then archive the email and don't even file the emails in project folders"<br><br>- I did the same but as I wrote in another topic with a little difference. <br>I use Omnifocus (GTD Macsoftware) since this morning. I only put what I really want to do in super focus and I use Omnifocus for planing my project and putting everything which is non actionable. When I dissmiss things I decide to re enter it in OF and I also add my someday tasks and what I am attending from other. So SF is like a INBOX and a central piloting point with nothing but actionable things. The result is incredible. I did in 2 hours what I did yesterday in half a day. I can' believe it. And I took time to plan and report non actionable tasks at a glance on OF for the future. <br><br>The system is indeed simple. During my writing a received a call about a client which is interestd by a buiding I sell. But I am already dealy the deal. So I simply put on OF the client's name on omnifocus project it's no actionable with no context and today's date. <br><br>Just after i received a call about a real estate partners who wanted some documents about a building I sell. As it is actionable guess where it goes ? in superfocus C2 as it is urgent. <br><br>Then i decided to work on my project plan about computer synchronization. The ipad will be released on march 25 th and there will be some consequences on my organization. So I just went to omnifocus and put the bigs rocks about this project. Writing it there was 2 actionable items the first one was that i needed to see the professional video so i wrote it directly on SFV3 C1, then there was the following of the ipad releasing. As it is on 25 th it goes directly on OF with a due date 25. <br><br>Then I wondered what i could plan I took my OF project list and red the all projects there was nothing. So I closed OF and return on my SF V3 action list. <br><br>The system is great, simple and fast indeed.<br><br>This week end i gona plan my strategy guess where ? On omnifocus of course and if there will be some actionable tasks they will go on superfocus !. But first i put it on my agenda to do it at the right time as a time blocked project.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, this is kind of Part of what I was trying to say in that weird thread I started. Strongly organize stuff outside SF, but your work goes in SF. <br><br>But it's not tasks (only) that have to be organized, but the info used by tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, now I get it! I think.<br><br>Jupiter, I basically like OmniFocus and would love to get my money's worth from it. I can see how your use cases would work nicely and dovetail with SuperFocus as the action list. I am mostly doing the same sort of thing, but in a less organized fashion, so thanks for sharing that.<br><br>Do you use OmniFocus' "perspectives"? If not, I'll bet they would turbocharge your system, giving you key readouts at a glance.<br><br>Alan, in your other thread I think you mentioned storing information according to various centralizing principles, including people, topics, and triggers? OmniFocus is very good at this sort of thing. You can combine search criteria, GTD-style context, project sub-folders, etc. into one specific view and save it as a "perspective" to recall any time with one click. But you may need to buy a real computer in order to run it.  ;-><br><br>With both "Omni" and "Super" on your side, how can you lose??</div>

<div class="content">Bernie<br><br>"Do you use OmniFocus' "perspectives"? If not, I'll bet they would turbocharge your system, giving you key readouts at a glance" <br><br>I discovered perspectives when I red the las david Allen's book. I will do it on omnifocus because they are great. But I need to read them again because it's not celar enought in my head for the present time. <br><br>But, I will also keep SF for acting. I spent the afternoon working and i can tell you it was a real success. With SF i did what I had to do and for once I am very satisfied. My weekly review will be very short. <br><br>I think I got it. With OF for non actionable tasks and perspective and Superfocus for acting and balancing my work with efficiency I gona be invincible LOL .</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, David Allen and OmniFocus use the word "perspective" for different things.<br><br>OmniFocus' Perspectives are really just saved searches, really "saved windows." You can set up a window with a search term, a project filter, sorting by whatever you want, grouping by whatever you want, etc., and then save the whole setup as a Perspective, to be recalled in one click.<br><br>For example, "show me all projects in the Personal folder tree, with due dates 1-2 months out, that are missing next-actions ..." Very powerful if you tailor these saved Perspectives to your review process.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, now I had the time to read everything in detail. Thank you for taking the time and writing so detailed. It's a great description of your working method. Maybe you should also install a "Donation button", as Mark did:-)<br><br>"(2) Automate meeting agendas" is perfectly clear. I'm totally with you regarding the Excel file.<br><br>But the connection between "(1) Simplify and streamline email processing" and "(4) Move *all* my own tasks to SuperFocus, and keep all my project-management work in appropriate files outside of SuperFocus." is not clear to me. Maybe I just need more experience with SF and some routine. But what do you mean with your "project files" resp. "files outside of SF". What do they look like? Maybe you also wrote about this issue and can give me a hint. <br><br>Thank you for your explanation and keep on writing such helpful posts:-)</div>

<div class="content">Sorry Seraphim, but I recognised that I forgot the sentence I was wondering about concerning email: "For project-related emails, I update my project files as needed, and then archive the email." Maybe my question is more specific now?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Carsten,<br><br>I wasn't very specific about my project files because I have different methods for tracking them.  <br><br>At work, most of my project files are in Microsoft OneNote.  Group projects go into a Shared Notebook that team members can access through Sharepoint.  My own individual projects resie on my own hard drive.  Each project has a "Section Group".  Then there is a section for Meetings (where I plan agendas and take minutes), another section for Action Items, and usually another one for Deliverables.  I also add other sections as needed for planning, reference, scratch, or whatever is needed.<br><br>So, when I said "For project-related emails, I update my project files as needed, and then archive the email", here is what I meant:  <br><br>- Do I need to take action?   If yes, then enter the action into SF, flag the email as a "To Do", and archive it.  Or, maybe I just need to make a quick update to the OneNote files.  For example, maybe someone is telling me that they completed their Action Item.  So, I open the OneNote file and update the Action Item there.<br><br>- Do I need to deal with this in our team meeting?  If yes, then I can add it to the agenda for the next meeting, or add it to the action item list, or just flag it as a "to do" and add the category label for that meeting; and then archive it.<br><br>- Do I just need to read the email but don't need to take any action?  Then I just read the email and archive it.  If I think I need to read it in more detail or ponder over it a bit, then I can enter into SF "Ponder email from NNN re XXX", flag it as a "To Do" and archive it.<br><br>The main thing is I don't worry where to put the emails unless it goes onto an agenda (and then it just gets a category label and a to-do flag, which require about 4 or 5 keystrokes to apply).  They all just get archived into one folder.  This saves so much time!   I used to file absolutely everything, and later I tried to categorize the "important" stuff.  Now, it's maybe 1 day per month that I get an email that needs to be filed in a special folder for safekeeping.<br><br><br>At home, my project files are usually tracked on paper, and usually just a collection of papers that I hold together with those clear plastic folders ( <a href="http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/741341/Office-Depot-Brand-Poly-Project-Files/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/741341/Office-Depot-Brand-Poly-Project-Files/</a> ).   They all sit on a shelf near my desk.<br><br>Some project files are somewhat more structured than that but are still mostly paper-based.<br><br>For all these kinds of things, if I get an email, then I jot something down in the papers, or just print out the email and file it with the other papers, or enter it as an action into SF.  It's generally quick and easy since I have a very simple filing system.<br><br><br>Hope that helps!<br><br><br>Does anyone else have practical ideas to share along these lines?   Everyone here is so innovative it's great to hear the practical details of how people handle things like this.</div>

<div class="content">Dear Seraphim,<br><br>Thanks that really helped a lot! I think I'll also try NEO. At the moment I'm using Outlook folders together with SpeedFiler (see <a href="http://www.claritude.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.claritude.com</a> ). That method works but maybe with NEO it's easier and more comfortable. <br><br>My idea for Group projects was to use Outlook tasks or Projectplace (see <a href="http://www.projectplace.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.projectplace.com/</a> ). I'm still experimenting:-) But SF I think can be the "master system", the one you can trust. A combination of paper and software will win the race I suppose.<br><br>Have a nice weekend!</div>

<div class="content">" SF I think can be the "master system", the one you can trust"<br><br>For team projects, I think not. The team project space is the master system and SF merely has the bits of that project you could work on yourself. Always go back to the project data for checking.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-19 22:11</div>
<div class="content">Alan, sorry I expressed myself incorrect. But you got it! That is what I really meant: The master system for one's own tasks. Maybe all team members should use SF for maximum output.</div>
