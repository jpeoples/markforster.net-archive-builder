<div class="content">UTMSi is certainly related to AF4. I don't think we have declared it "superior" on this forum, though it may work better for some people.<br><br>A "natural successor" - sure, it evolved from AF4 in that it came later and adds a simple but powerful-looking modification.<br><br>This site contains many, many task management strategies. In most cases there is not a clear winner, but rather many options for various situations and temperaments. Some people report finding one and using it successfully for a long time, others switch and switch and switch.<br><br>I am about to contribute yet another such strategy! New thread coming ...</div>

<div class="content">UTMS (original) was one of the most effective systems of Mark's I've tried, including being better than the other three you listed. However, I did not like the "improved" version. I do not continue to use UTMS, but I found it pretty effective while I was using it.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for reminding me about this one. And Bernie is right in saying that it evolved from AF4.<br><br>I'm tending at the moment to move away from systems which involve a to do list as you can see from the current discussion about SMEMA.</div>
