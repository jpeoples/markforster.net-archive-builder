<div class="content">A couple of days into AF4 I'm finding that I'm using my rational side much more than I think I ought to be as I work the open list - because I know I have only one pass through it before I have to go back to the closed list.  There's something about knowing I can cycle through a closed list multiple times before moving on to the next "thing" (whether - as in AF1 - that's just the next closed list, or AF4's open list) that makes it easier for me to trust my intuition.  It's almost as if I think something will get missed on the open list even though logically, I know that there's nothing really urgent (as in, the world will end if I don't do it right now) on that list.  But there it is - seeming resistance to going back to the closed list.<br><br>I'm not sure how this will ultimately play out, what it means for the system, but I found it a curious observation.  Is anyone else having the same experience?  How are you dealing with it?</div>

<div class="content">In the beginning, yes. But I get used to it. I think it's one of the engines of the system: You pass through the open list and return to the closed list with the (subconscious) feeling that you need to pass the open list again as soon as possible... so you don't get lost in the closed list.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">My radical take on this: Autofocus really isn't about "intuitive versus rational" at all — I think those terms are heavily misused on this site. (I don't really mind, though, since AF is so fantastic and has been so useful to me.) We're really talking about how far you are able to let yourself do "appetizing" tasks, versus how far you make yourself do the tasks you think you need to do. That's not really intuition versus rationality — it's present-orientation versus future-orientation. The different AF systems just strike different balances between these, and are differently appropriate to different lifestyles. So I guess all I'm saying is don't worry about how much you "ought" to be using one side of your brain or the other, *if* the results you're getting are what you desire.</div>

<div class="content">I still don't really understand how critical the one pass rule is to the system.  I'm really enjoying AF4 but have succumbed to this habit of scanning up and down the open list until my "Switch to Closed list" task stands out; in a sense I see this as being the point at which the two lists 'balance'.<br><br>The pressure in the system seems to build from wanting to start a new active list and therefore having to somehow 'deal with' the existing closed list.  I'll end up working the closed list until I simply feel drawn back to the open list to check that there's nothing urgent there.<br>  <br>Martin</div>

<div class="content">I am finding that taking only one pass through the Open List has led me to be much more likely to actually take action on those items.  Not that I've really been consciously thinking about it.  I guess I have just realized that it's better to do something NOW than to have to wait till "next time around" (which could be several hours).<br><br>Taking action on most of the Open List items also means I stay in Open List mode longer, since many of those items get added again to the end of the Open List, and I can take action again on them this very same passthrough.  <br><br>So, that is what happens when I am feeling any pressure from the urgency of those Open List tasks.  When the pressure and urgency cool off, then it's easier to let those items go, and transition into processing the Closed List / Backlog.</div>
