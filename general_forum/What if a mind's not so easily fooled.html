<div class="meta">2009-03-2 21:13</div>
<div class="content">I find myself using two different 'strategies' to avoid the confrontation with dreaded tasks: <br><br>(1) Either I don't write them down on the list in the first place. This mostly happens with my home/personal list, where notably exactly the tasks I fear most are missing. And it's not because I didn't think of them. Instead, I have them in my head all the time. I just can't make me write them down. Unfortunately, most of those tasks are quite monolithic and don't easily submit to 'little and often'. Which is, btw, the prime reason they haven't been done before. And not doing them before has made matters worse, and helped to generate even more fear. Which constituted a vicious circle that seemingly even AF can't break.<br><br>(2) Or, if the list only contains 'ugly' tasks, I tend to avoid using the list at all, and run myself in 'off the top of my head' mode. This mostly happens to my work list, and this counter-productive behaviour is fostered at my workplace by lots of random interruptions and the kind of very short deadlines I've already written about several times. In addition, I have a hard time to find any 'fun' or easy items to make this list more 'attractive', due to it being an exclusive work list. <br><br>In a way, this reminds me of what Mark wrote in the first chapter of "Do It Tomorrow" about the mind 'fighting back' against the idea of doing what one is resisting most. It looks like my mind knows exactly what nasties are somewhere inside the list and either refuses to having them written down or just plainly rejects the whole list.<br><br>While I don't have any idea how to attack the first problem (1) - I managed to get some long-resisted tasks done by _somehow_ breaking them down into little-and-often chunks, but some others just aren't accessible that way -, I'm thinking about abandoning AF for work and returning to DIT, with the idea that clearly sizing down a day's workload might make the difference. Those tasks aren't *that* ugly, the sheer number of them might be the core problem.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex,<br>So sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed by both work and home tasks.<br>I do think that although you might not be able to see a way to break things down into smaller bites, I have found that there is almost always a way to do this.  <br>Maybe once you get some confidence with your ability to get things done with the system, you'll feel more confidence in yourself?<br>Why not try writing them - not on your AF list - but on a separate list?  Then try working on the item that generates the least anxiety.  Maybe not by breaking it down, but just by starting for 1 minute?  <br>It's very hard to give better advice without knowing more specifics.  Just know that the board would be very supportive if you need any help - there's a lot of creative thinkers on here and maybe you need more creative solutions to your issues right now?  Anxiety and overwhelm certainly does seem to kill creativity.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex,<br><br>I am no stranger to that feeling of resistance. I feel your pain.<br><br>One thing I love about AF is its flexibility. With a little creativity, you can break through your layers of resistance step-by-step, even if they are baby steps.<br><br>For example, you might add a task such as "write tasks related to project X" or "write down one ugly task". At some point that task will look much more appealing than the other ugly tasks on your list! :-)<br><br>Re: resisting actually opening the book. First, think why you are resisting. Perhaps you have a pressing deadline and you already know what you need to work on? <br><br>If you simply have an aversion to doing work, try forming a habit of idly browsing the AF book. No commitment to do anything. Just take those times that you would normally check email or make coffee and take the opportunity to read through your tasks. If you're really having trouble, take this opportunity to face your guilt/overwhelm. Confront each task, recognize that you can't do everything at once, and allow yourself to NOT do that task. With enough read-throughs you might just find a task that you do want to start with.</div>

<div class="content">Also try actually writing down "work on x for fifteen minutes" on your AF list, even though 'x' is a task best done in a very long single stint.<br><br>Previously I'd write down "work on x report" without specifying the time requirement element, and even though I'd tell myself I could work on it 'little and often' to get it done, I wouldn't actually do ANYTHING, because my mind knew perfectly well this was a task that could only be done in one long stretch. (Notice, by the way, how procrastinors use prison metaphors to describe their tasks!)<br><br>But now, when I *see* "fifteen minutes" actually written down, somehow the task is diminished, as is my resistance to it. <br><br>And I'm finding that once I've actually done that fifteen minutes on 'x', the resistance has completely melted away, and I'm well on my way.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Alex:<br><br>I think little b's technique is the best answer, though you might initially try an even shorter period than 15 minutes, such as 5 minutes - or in extreme circumstances even shorter! <br><br>Make sure that you actually stop when the 5 minutes are up. The knowledge that you are going to do this will help you to get started. It also means that when you re-enter the task, you mind will be that much more willing to get moving again.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex, <br><br>I think the advice above is all very excellent - but it sounds to me from what you said in your post that you're not even at the point of where you even feel comfortable writing the project/situation down - according to what you say below:<br><br>"Either I don't write them down on the list in the first place. This mostly happens with my home/personal list, where notably exactly the tasks I fear most are missing. And it's not because I didn't think of them. Instead, I have them in my head all the time. I just can't make me write them down."<br><br>I think one of the best, most user-friendly books in this area is Susan Jeffers' "Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway."  It's a classic - here's the link to it on google books:<br><br><a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=uzI2JADQmgUC&dq=feel+the+fear+and+do+it+anyway&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.ca/books?id=uzI2JADQmgUC&dq=feel+the+fear+and+do+it+anyway&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0</a><br><br>Please check it out, it really is an excellent resource, even for those who are just resisting doing some things, not actually fearful of them.<br><br>All the best!<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex<br><br>Jacqueline's book recommendation is an excellent one.<br><br>I know what you mean about the resistance to writing certain items down - I have had a few of those and the reluctance to write them down can be more than just resistance but a real physical aversion. Another suggestion ........... take those items and write them down on a separate piece of paper, or an index card, then just put that list aside.  Don't make any plans at all to look at that list, (but do remember where you put it!)  Go back to your AF lists, knowing that there is nothing really nasty lurking there, and ensure that you have Thinking Time listed.  When you action the Thinking Time task, just spend some time thinking about the ways in which AF has enabled you to identify reasons for resistance and the changes you have made as a result.<br><br>That will do three things - (1) it will increase your trust in the system, and in particular it's ability to handle resistance, (2) it will be setting a precedent to prepare you for handling future occurrences of resistance and (3) it will be working on finding a solution to the items you are not thinking about on that list.<br><br>In say a month's time, take that list out and look at it.  If you feel like adding one or all of the items to the list do so.  If not put it aside for another month and repeat.<br><br>The reasoning behind this suggestion is the fact that, instinctinctively, you probably have a pretty good idea as to the reasons for the resistance, or alternatively you believe that whatever the reasons are it is not something you are willing to face at this present time.  That is ok and is an ok response - but only for a period of time.  At some point those things need to be faced or dismissed for ever.  If dismissal is not an option then they must be faced.   AF's approach to resistance is totally non-threatening - we are not forced to "do" anything.  Consequently, the stronger our trust in the system, the more willing we will be to let it loose on our real "nasties". <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Alex, Here's a piece out of Jeffers' book:<br><br>Five Truths about Fear<br>Truth 1. The fear will never go away as long as I continue to grow.<br>Truth 2. The only way to get rid of the fear of doing something is to go out and do it.<br>Truth 3. The only way to feel better about myself is to go out… and do it.<br>Truth 4. Not only am I going to experience fear whenever I’m on unfamiliar territory, but so is everyone else.<br>Truth 5. Pushing through fear is less frightening than living with the underlying fear that comes from a feeling of helplessness.<br><br>Again, excellent book, can't recommend it highly enough.<br></div>

<div class="content">Alex, do you have a door that you can close or another office where you can work?  Random interruptions are a killer and in open environments it can make focusing on your work very difficult.  I used to be a manager at a large public company in charge of corporate reporting and the whole office was open concept (supposedly facilitating open communication!)  I used to wear a set of head phones occasionally although I can't stand listening to anything when I'm working, so I wasn't actually tuned into anything.  People would be less apt to interrupt unless it was really important when I did that.  Otherwise, I used to shift my hours around so I would start at 6:30 and get my work done where I needed to focus in the first couple of hours before anyone else showed up.   In the past I've even requested to move away from some people who are distractions.<br><br>I remember reading in a book once that sometimes, in some jobs, your job IS the interruptions.  If one of my team needed my input for 2 minutes and it saved them 2 hours of work going down the wrong path, I was happy to be interrupted.<br><br>I am also being constantly interrupted by the person I'm replacing that's going on leave and have resigned myself to the fact that I'm not going to be able to really work the system properly and the way I want until she's finally gone at the end of this week.  Thank goodness she has lots of Doctor appointments!   I did mention to her on a couple of occasions that I don't work well in a very scattered way.  If she was staying longer, I would really push the point.   She has commented that she does feel guilty when she interrupts me and I say "just let me finish this."  Then I very deliberately - and slowly - draw a line through the task I was working on while she waits.   I think given time I could train her...<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Maybe I should be using a ruler - that would drag it out even more!  <br><br>This morning I had enough and told her nicely to stop interrupting me if she ever wanted me to get anything done - fortunately we're friends so I can do this.  She left me alone all morning apart from emailing me with things (which is a bit silly because we sit 10 feet apart) so then she can pop out with things when the ideas come to her and I don't have to hear them right at that time - because unlike her, I have my email off for most of the day. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Mark and others, <br><br>thank you for your advice. <br><br>However, the tips about breaking the tasks down or working on it a little are beside the point, unfortunately.  The tasks I had in mind with problem (1) when I called them 'monolithic' basically *are* all-or-nothing tasks. Usually, they involve some confrontation with persons, instutions or situations that I'm not able to cope with. It's more a behaviour of hiding than one of procrastinating. Those confrontations are usually seen as humiliating, dangerous, painful or the like.<br><br>As an example: <br>(Please note that this is *not* a real-life example of my dreaded tasks, it just happens to have the same structure.) <br><br>Let's assume you're horrified by the thought of going to the dentist (more precisely: the treatment by the dentist, any dentist). So you just don't go. For years. Nothing on earth could make you go there (of course, the pain finally will, but let's leave this option out of the picture for the moment). You know you should, but you can't. <br><br>There's no way to really break down 'going to the dentist' into smaller parts. You could take some preparational action (like making an appointment), but IMO this doesn't count as really working on the task. And preparational actions are overshadowed by the same amount of fear like the real task. <br><br>Sometimes, tasks like these involve not knowing how to handle them because of delicate consequences for relationships with your family, your employer etc. <br><br>As another example: <br><br>You have an ongoing dispute with the personnel department about a rather large contribution payment. You have been turned down by someone from the personnel department who told you your claim had expired. You know for sure that it hasn't. So you have to write a letter to the head of said department. Unfortunately, this person is (a) powerful, (b) doesn't really like you (which is not your fault) and (c) ultimately, you would have to take this claim to court which would not be beneficial for your job even if you win. You cannot find a way to write that letter, even though you know that if you bring forward your claim politely, you'll probably succeed.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, <br><br>thank you for the book recommendation. This seems to point into the right direction. I'm not sure the book is for me (from what I could see on Amazon), but I might try it. <br><br>As for the interruptions, there's nothing I can do about them. No, my job isn't primarily the interruptions, but they're unavoidable. I probably have to train me to return to my list afterwards.</div>

<div class="content">Alex,<br><br>I know precisely the kind of tasks you're fighting against. They are my Achilles Heel tasks too. I am finding the best way of dealing with it is to do one tiny thing.<br><br>Eg - I'm sitting on a £3k insurance claim that I haven't submitted to my insurer for 4 months even though they have already approved it in principle. During that time I've even been overdrawn, but still that hasn't forced me to deal with it.<br><br>Today I thought I'd do just one tiny thing to get the claim moving, so I opened up a Word Document and wrote the address of the insurer before closing it again. Tomorrow I'll make myself find one relevant receipt. Yes, it would be a lot less hassle to do in one go, but doing it this way is the only way I can make myself do it at all.<br><br>Same with the dentist - you don't need to make an appointment just yet, but maybe get the name and number of your best friend's dentist.<br><br>And yes, it definitely counts towards crossing off!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex, sometimes I find that if a book has even ONE idea that I can take away that improves my life in some way, it's worth it to me.  Maybe it's a take out of the library thing rather than a buy though.<br><br>On the dentist (a phobia of mine) / other fear-inducing items - I still think there are ways around this - eg. check out sedation dentistry, find a Dr. that gives valium prior to treatments, check out a hypnotist to reduce anxiety (believe it or not, I've seen a CD that deals with exactly this).  On the personnel head side - check out books on how to suck up/make people like you - other than that I can't think of anything for that one. :-)<br>All easy for me to say though.  Hard to do in practice I'm sure.<br><br>It's also easy to say you can train yourself to get back on task after interruptions and very difficult in practice if you're anything like me.  I know it's extremely hard for me to get back into a focused zone / rhythym of work after I've been interrupted unless it's a very minor question.  Especially if someone's giving me another job to do when they interrupt, then my mind wanders like you wouldn't believe and I can't focus on what they're asking me to do because I'm still back thinking about the project I've been interrupted on.<br><br>Maybe you can start with making small steps towards learning how to protect your boundaries and develop some confrontational skills.  That's another tough one, but I think it would pay off in every area of life.  I used to be bad at that too. I learned that the best thing that worked for that was having enough !@#$-you money put aside  - it results in a much stronger backbone.  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I like Christine's idea of a staging area for "fearful" tasks. I've been using a multicolored pen to differentiate tasks based on how I feel about them at the time I write them down - green for mindless and/or fun, blue for a bit more challenge, and red for actively fearful. The problem is that I kickstarted the notebook by emptying the remains of a failing GTD system into it, with a lot of procrastinated fearful tasks. That meant my first few pages had a *lot* of red on them. <br><br>If I were to do it over I'd try the idea of a staging area that I could dump all the fearful tasks onto, and then dole them out slowly over time, one or two on a page.Then the pages would be a lot easier to get through at the start :)<br><br>btw, the good news is that now some of the stuff that used to always be red gets written down in blue instead!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jonathan<br><br>A word of caution over the coloured pen approach - by marking the items in that way you are effectively grading them to a degree and telling your subconscious to be aware of certain tasks.  the system is obvioulsy working in that some red tasks have turned blue but be aware that you may be influencing your subconscious in a way you do not wish to do ..........<br><br>I had a lot of backlog and pending tasks in my old system which I am gradually off loading into AF - it is better to add a few at a time - I try to average about 6 or so at a time - so that they do not take over a page and it is amazing how things do become less threatening.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-5 18:51</div>
<div class="content">Don't worry, I'm definitely aware of what's going on :) In my case the colored pen actually engages my conscious mind to be aware of what my subconscious mind was doing anyway, i.e. grading things in a certain way.  If the tasks are all in black ink then I will tend to always do first the ones that my subconscious mind spots as "easier". If they're in red/blue/green, then after a couple of green ones there's a little part of my conscious mind that says "ok, now I'm ready to do something a little tougher", and takes over from the subconscious slacker. <br><br>Essentially I'm surfacing some subconscious habits so that my conscious mind can make better decisions about them. This works well for me.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-5 18:53</div>
<div class="content">Hi Alex<br><br>The examples you give explain clearly the type of issues where it is an all or nothing approach.  The "problem" as such is that it is not the item itself that is the problem but the associated fear factor.<br><br>Taking the dentist scenario as an example, you are right that any action taken (making the appointment etc) is so intrinsically linked to the end result that it is not a case where "just making the call" will progress the task - well actually it IS the case that it will progress the task but that is not what you want!<br><br>In cases such as the financial claim, again the issue in that type of scenario is not the task itself but the association - for example fear of conflict, or the fact that it raises other issue regarding finances. <br><br>If you suspect that some of your "bete noirs" have other attachments, and you can identify what they may be, then in addition to putting those tasks aside in the way I suggested, you could add a task to your lists to just look at those issues.  By separating the root cause from the tasks themselves it becomes less threatening.  For example a task to "look at methods to overcome fear of conflict" is far easier to do than "call the ogre who is going to shout at me".<br><br>A very good book that deals with worry (which we have to the nth degree over such issues!) is an old book by Dale Carnegie called How to Stop Worrying and Start Living.  One of the tips is to think of the worst that can happen - it is invariably never as bad as we have somehow psyched ourselves up to think.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jonathan<br><br>Glad that is working ok for you :-)  Of course AutoFocus enables us to ultimately address all items - doing the items our subconscious considers easy at the time is a lot easier than trying to tell it it ought to do something else ........ I always found it hard to push the "oughts" away, now I don't need to ........</div>
