<div class="content">link to a YouTube video I made: <a href="http://youtu.be/eeDWyS0XJjY" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/eeDWyS0XJjY</a><br><br>I have been playing a lot of Castles of Burgundy lately, and it has been having an amazing affect on my productivity and strategizing IRL. <br><br>By crossing the dynamics in the board game with Mark's concept of a closed list: ( <a href="http://blog.workflowy.com/how-to-use..." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.workflowy.com/how-to-use...</a> )you can create a simple and flexible daily throughput workflow that has been really accelerating my completion rate of high-value tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I read your article. It's a great talk on the Closed List. My current practice involves two closed lists and they are motivation in the way you describe. Adapting my Sooner or Later process, the Closed lists are my guarantee things will be tackled. The way it works in part is I add a bunch of stuff to Later, then draw a line. Every thing above the line is the closed list. Below the line is an open list. Whenever I select items from Later to act on, I always start by picking one or more Closed section items. So over time the closed list becomes empty. And then I close off the open part of this list and start a new open section. <br><br>This much is judt like AF4, but I'm not looping the Closed list. And the role is to feed into the Sooner list which has a similar open/closed structure.</div>

<div class="content">I didn't fully grasp the game aspect of your video but the idea of rewards for completing closed lists seems worth trying. For a Today list, the reward might be free time to do whatever.</div>

<div class="content">Really neat video! It's funny how many things seem to come back to the two Personal Kanban principles of Limit your WIP and Visual Your Work. It seems that figuring out how to achieve these in a way that works for you is a terrific lens through which to build a system.</div>
