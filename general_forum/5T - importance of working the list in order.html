<div class="content">The 5T rules (in Secrets of Productive People) state:<br>"Do the tasks in order."<br><br>I suppose the point of this rule is to "just get going".   But I'm finding it works best using the FVP algorithm on that short list of 3-5 items.<br><br>Mark - do you see any downside using the FVP algorithm with the 5T method?   I can't think of any personally -- it's very simple and fast and effective -- but perhaps you have some ideas.<br><br>I do the same thing with my Dynamic Lists -- same question there.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>If it works for you, use it. My own experience of using FVP on a short list like that is that one or two tasks get neglected. In theory you could have the same two tasks on your list all day without either of them being worked on even once.<br><br>With dynamic lists I say they can be done in any order.</div>

<div class="content">I did FVP on my 5T list yesterday and, indeed, the very first item only got actioned late in the day and only because it mocked me for being undone.</div>
