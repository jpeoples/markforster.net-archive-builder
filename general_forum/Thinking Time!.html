<div class="content">An observation I have made on using the system to date is the way that my mind seems a lot sharper and more focused on what is really important rather than on my previously guilt ridden list of never ending ought to's.  When I am doing "what feels right" at the time, there is no effort to it and I am finding that my mind is incredibly active working on other issues, planning or coming up with ideas.  I seem to have regained a degree of enthusiasm and excitement which had to all intents and purposes been drained out of me through what felt like incontrollable circumstances.<br><br>I am adding a recurring task of "thinking time" to my list and offer that as a suggestion to all who feel like trying it.  So far that has led me to add a couple of things to my task list that I thought would never again see the light of day, such as write the book I've been planning for some time now, there I've said it - have to do it now! :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Yes, I have exactly the same task on my list, and I've just finished one. Main subject: "What's next?" <br><br>Some exciting developments on the Autofocus theme, I hope!</div>

<div class="content">At the end of day two of trying Autofocus I have to say that being allowed to put "Thinking Time" on your list is one of the greatest advantages of Autofocus in contrast to GTD. <br><br></div>
