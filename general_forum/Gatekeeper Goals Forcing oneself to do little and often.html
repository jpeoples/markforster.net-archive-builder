<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>As we all wait for Mark's new revision for SAF, I was reflecting on his goals for the said revision.  It seems the main goal is for a system that forces the user to do "little and often" on difficult/long term/important tasks, while not neglecting other tasks.  Am I right, Mark?<br><br>Whether or not this is the case, it seems to be a very good idea, and I was wondering if it can be applied to how I do my task management.  I came up with I would term "Gatekeeper Goals", which I think can be applied to many other systems.  I'm using it right now.<br><br>You will need your task management system (AF, DWM, etc.), a Post It pad (a 2"x2" one will do), and a pen.<br><br>1. Title your Post It paper "Gatekeeper Goals". Choose a few (probably up to five or so; three is a good number) difficult and/or highly important tasks/goals, and list them on your Post It.<br><br>2. Remove the Post It and stick it on the NEXT NON-URGENT page of your TMS notebook from where you are currently working on (i.e. not on the last page of AF1-4 or SAF, nor on the open list of AF4, nor on the 7th or 30th day of DWM, nor on any Column 2 of SAF, nor on the New and Unfinished parts  of AF4R).  The Post It should cover what is written on the beginning of the first lines of that page.<br><br>3. Upon reaching the page with the Gatekeeper Goals, you can process that page only if you remove the Post It and stick it to the NEXT NON-URGENT page, and you can do this only if you do the following:<br>a) work on one of the Gatekeeper Goals, either finishing it or not.  If you work on it but do not finish it, put a check mark (√) to the right of it.  If you finish it, cross it out with a line.<br>b) check on one of the Gatekeeper Goals and determine what should be the next task to achieve that goal (i.e. it is a project and you want to plan for it).  In this case, after doing this, you can place a dot (•) to the right of it. The next time you work on the said goal, you can only work on a task for it that is NOT planning, upon which you write a check mark (√) over the dot.<br>c) determine that you cannot do any of the Gatekeeper Goals right now because of your current circumstances.<br><br>NOTE 1: Urgent items should always be done first before Gatekeeper Goals: if you urgently need to do something in the page, do it first, then do step 3.<br><br>NOTE 2: Deleting a Gatekeeper Goal without doing it can be done (for example it is not important anymore or you did it previously), but will NOT remove the Post It from the current page; you still need to do step 3.<br><br>4. Replenish the Gatekeeper Goals if there are at the most one goal left.<br><br>EDIT: I guess you can also add a "Daily Initiative" goal to the Post It, just tag it with a different symbol at the beginning to denote it needs only to be done once a day.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I'm sorry, Mark.  I didn't realize you would consider my question to be of that sort.<br><br>God bless, and again sorry.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I have to admit that I am very surprised how effective the Gatekeeper Goals System (GKS) is in my use.  Because of it, I have started projects that have languished for MONTHS, and I am making good progress.  It really forced me to do little and often.<br><br>In practice, the GKS actually has the feel of the Three Task System (3TS), but none of the feeling of being restricted that I felt in the latter.  The similarity is that one is forced to do a few goals, but instead of these goals being the ONLY tasks that I can do (3TS), they are the tasks that at least one of which I must do BEFORE I can do the others (GKS).  This feels  quite liberating, actually.  I may have to be forced in the beginning to do something that I really don't like, but after doing the GKS I have the feeling that I have done something productive, and I am able to process my AF then with more confidence.  And by the end of the day, I can see the checkmarks beside the goals of the GKS Post-It, which give me the sense of accomplishment of something worthwhile.<br><br>The GKS also gave me the feeling of being on top of everything.  I now do the habit of reviewing my AF in the evening to look for goals to add to the GKS Post-It.  I guess what I am doing is replicating the effects of Matt (2mc)'s system, and I can now see why he is so enthused by it.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Like Nuntym, I like keeping a short list of recurring tasks, including working on big projects. Rather than having to do something on the Post-It each time I pass it, I consider it part of my current page.  Seeing that I haven't tackled a project in several days often make stand out for me.</div>
