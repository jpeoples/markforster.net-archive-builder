<div class="content">Hi all <br>Sorry for not being very active on this forum for the present time for I had a lot of work to do. <br>After quiet a lot of incredible adventure i finally got my new ipad 2. I could not resist to buy th new omnifocus version and I must tell you I am stuck ! <br><br>The software is a killer. It's simple, powerful, easy the sync is great so I can have it on my ipad, my iphone and my mac with mobile me (but there are many ways to sync) and it's easy. <br><br>The ipad is simple. It's like a paper notebook and I like it very much. <br><br>What I find incredible is the possibility to put pdf of my own writing and access it anywhere with drop box. Of course everything is sync so always up to date<br><br>No complicated system, I use quiet the note app which is simple and easy to work with. <br>Little by little I find a way to do all what I did with paper on my ipad and I find it very easy. <br>I have the special feeling to do things at the right time. <br><br>Just have a look about the video omnifocus and Ipad is really worth too <br><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-ipad/videos/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-ipad/videos/</a></div>

<div class="content">Please do provide updates as you practice with the iPad. I'm trying to convince myself to get one!<br><br>I just tried today to do SuperFocus via OmniFocus on the Mac. I do like OF, but found it awkward (compared to paper) for doing SuperFocus.</div>

<div class="content">I tried to adapt Sf with OF but I fell. SF is definitively made for paper. <br><br>My problem is simple. I struggle with it for years. <br>It is not about doing things. I do and I am motivated too. <br>My problem is about getting the most of my time<br>My problem is also to follow tasks and projects. Ie to have a real collecting of all I have to do about a specific project. If I want to do my account I need to now straight away what to do or not, even If I decide not to do something. SF can show me that except on reading the all list and did i think about everything ? Having all in one place let me think about it and make me see the all project and action at a glance. <br><br>BUT SF as AF ad AF4 as all systems are incredibly efficient for doing things. I guess they are perfect for proscratrinators. But they have a terrible failure for people like me. As chairman I deal will a lot of subjects at the same time. This morning I closed the 2010 year and so I had my accountant. Happily I prepared all I wanted to speak with him and all my question so it was finished in 15 mn. After I had a client about a building. I had to explained all the deal and how we could do it. After I had to go shopping because I have a trip to do and so I needed a few things, I had my errands list and did it in half an our. When I came back I had to check all the elements about another deal I hope to close soon. I had my project about it and in 5 mn I listed on Omnifocus all I wanted to speak about with the seller and I put all the dead lines about each elements. All was finished in 15 mn. I stop here but I did about 10 mores things in the same day dealing always with different subjects. <br><br>So Omnifocus is a great help for me. I can use it as a note book, as a checklist editor, as a diary, as a planner, as a focus planner, and so many things. I am discovering my ipad for the moment I don't know exactly how to find the best use. I just see that it is placed in the midle of my use of my iphone and my mac. But it is easy and I like it. <br><br>Today I did not write a single line on paper. But I done many tasks and reported a lot. <br>There is something I use very much. It's the MF double reading. <br><br>For contextes they are more and more general. Here they are. <br>Call<br>Work on dossier<br>Actions<br>Formation<br>Following<br>Loisirs<br>Errands<br>Opporties<br>Ts les jours<br>NOTES. <br>Someday / Maybe list ?<br>Gelé<br><br>The Ipad Omnifocus software made me think about the way I manage my projects. If you are interested I will report how I will do it.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I'd love to hear more! <br><br>I can honestly say that I've gotten more done using SuperFocus than any other system I've tried. I often tried OmniFocus and found it great for organizing and planning, but not so good for "doing". This is where Mark's systems really shine--they provide a clear, clean method for DOING your tasks.<br><br>Still, I keep getting pulled toward OmniFocus--I really like being able to categorize with contexts and projects.<br><br>To me the holy grail is the organization of OmniFocus plus the motivation of Super Focus.</div>

<div class="content">Hi DS I agree with you. I thought it was so. <br><br>Still I used OF on my Mac or my Iphone I was un able to do things but OF was perfect for planning and organizing. <br><br>So I reported each night my stuff on SF and there was some difficulties about checking all perfectly. <br><br>A change happened when I had yesterday OF for Ipad. <br>The ergonomy and the way it works is totally different from the previous version. More, the focus by project is just incredible on the ipad because it's like a sheet of paper. <br><br>Th multitasking of the os make possible to work on evernote, apple note, taskpaper and so on. The warehouse of dropbox for ipad make possible to organize projects by folder and drop .pdf, .page, numbers, xls, picture, and so on. I also use it as projects mindmap.<br><br>For the moment I dont use SF anymore because the system is so easy than I go very fast and I do all I have to do at a glance. I don t use very much my contexts exept FOLLOW where i put my waiting for items and CALL.<br><br>I must admit that the Ipad is indeed special. It makes with me the feeling of paper  BUT it has the power of a computer and realy the new OF for Ipad has nothing to see with all software I tries before (I tried over a 300 software including monkey GTD, todledoo, Things and so on....) <br><br>What I like with the ipad is that special feeling to have all under control because every important thing is in one place, actionable and easy. <br><br>I will put on my Ipad nothing but what I really need. This will be the most difficult to do and control. <br><br>I admit there is a before and after the Ipad. <br><br>Nothing else to say.</div>

<div class="content">Just curious - does the new iPad use handwriting recognition of some kind?  Or do you enter with one of those touch-keyboards?</div>
