<div class="content">Because of the debate about "catch all lists" and "no-lists" I've been using a hybrid approach for the last few days.<br><br>My "no-lists" comprises 3 items. I rotate around them in time boxes of 25 minutes each. When an item is done it's replaced immediately so there are always 3 tasks or projects in progress.<br><br>One of the items is usually my AF list.<br><br>This approach allows me to give considerable time and focus to one or two bigger projects whilst still being able to deal with the smaller tasks that I might otherwise forget.<br><br>I'm finding that I'm making significant progress on work that would not "stand out" when just using an AF catch all approach.</div>

<div class="content">Caibre65:<br><br>I tried a similar thing years ago (I wrote about it somewhere on the blog but I can't find it). I used the original 3T method and filled it from an AF list (AF4 I think).<br><br>The difference seems to be that you are doing the other way round, i.e. using AF as a task within 3T. That certainly sounds a promising approach though I would classify it as more "catch all" than "no-list". Not that that matters as long as the work gets done!</div>
