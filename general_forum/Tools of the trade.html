<div class="content">I've been in a bit of a pickle lately and finding it hard to get back to productivity. I am planning to start the new AF1 system tomorrow to get me back on track.<br><br>Based on Mark's recommendations, I have a moleskin I want to use (I tried a filofax but somehow it didn't work for me), however I wonder what you all use for your projects lists/planning?  Do you use a separate notebook?  This may sound like a daft question, but I find things like this trip me up. I want to start tomorrow with a really clear idea of where to start.</div>

<div class="content">A binder with pages inserted alphabetically by subject. This is separate from my AF list, because the list is easier to carry around then.</div>

<div class="content">I usually keep projects organised on Word files, which have the advantage that they can link to files, emails and websites.<br><br>The table function in Word can be used to give the details of the project, plus listing action needed.</div>

<div class="content">I just use a 100 page spiral notebook like in college.  I need something pages easily rip out of for the Triple Task System I am using now.</div>

<div class="content">Alison:<br><br>It's not a daft question at all, I suspect many of us like to get the tools of the trade right for each of us!<br><br>I am with Alan and Mark on this: <br>- moleskine large notebook (or similar, moleskine large = approximately A5, can fit into jacket pocket, briefcase, folder, handbag easily) for the list itself.<br>- binder so that projects can be sorted the way you like them, although I think alphabetic is the least hassle as Alan suggests, and I've tried some filing and coding options in my time!<br>- Word, OneNote or paper so that project task lists can be carried around in the binder/file.<br><br>Although I have used paper and pen for 90% of my AF/SAF experience, I still hanker after a suitable digital solution.  <br><br>My April 2008 Toshiba notebook is a tablet and accepts handwriting with the supplied digitiser pen (proper handwriting capability on a device is not just 'touch' which is bandied about by all the manufacturers right now), but it is unwieldy and a tad heavy to tote around and have ready at any time.  I use its 12.1" screen along with an external monitor most of the time (ageing eyes!).  The external monitor is great (19") when working in standing mode at my work or apartment desk.<br><br>My own nirvana would be this:<br><br>- Notebook with 15" screen at the work desk.<br>- Notebook or desktop at the apartment.<br>- Tablet/Slate with handwriting capability which would travel with me and synchronise with the other two devices via the local network (small, peer for me mostly), Dropbox or maybe a cloud.<br><br>The tablet/slate would sit on my desk for quick notes at the office or apartment, meetings etc.  It would have MS Office including OneNote (some tablets come with Evernote) which I would use for SAF.  It would NOT have graphics-intensive packages like Photoshop.<br><br>I will NOT go for the iPad (sorry, Erik, ;-((( ), I may have to wait a bit longer, however the HP Slate 500 looks promising with its 8,9" screen, total dimensions probably just a bit bigger than the moleskine large notebook.<br><br>I will post on this when I get such a device and let all know about its use for SAF, or SDAF (Super Duper SAF) as Mark finds yet another productivity adaptation.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone. I've decided that despite working from home most of the time, I will keep separate lists for home and work (this is to try and reduce my tendancy to work all the time!). I think I will set up my project lists on Word and I can print them out to review if I want to and keep them in a seperate binder.<br><br>I want to make sure I carve out some of the day (i.e. some of the evening) for personal activities, so keeping a seperate means I won't constantly be reminded of work tasks I haven't done yet!  There is no reason why I can't consult my home list during the day to maken sure I have got something out of the freezer for dinner, or put the washing in!<br><br>I'll see how it works and I look forward to being better organised and more productive!</div>

<div class="content">Just an update for those of you who may require additional notebooks!<br><br>I love moleskin, but some people find them a bit pricey. If you are in the UK Asda Supermarket do some great notebooks that are moleskin look alikes. They are amazingly cheap (from £2), have the elastic and a piece of ribbon to help you mark pages. Also the paper is fantastic if you like fountain pens - it is quite thick and smooth. I have an A5 one for work, and an A6 one for home both with squared paper.  The covers aren't quite as smooth as moleskin, but they are a great way to find out if you like this sort of notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I've done my first day. A great improvement on my performance in the last few weeks - and I have a sense of what I should be doing as well instead of just panicing about it! I like the idea of a list even if I can't get to do it all - I know it is safely written down for tomorrow.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Your "stalagmite /stalactite" method sounds ingenious! I'm doing SAF using a single book, and am finding that I'm cycling through all the pages quite frequently. The constant rescans (presently at work) are getting to me, because there are quite a few home-only items that I cannot process from here. I think I'll try your method on the next new page. I never wanted to carry around two books, and it wouldn't work for me to keep one in each place, since I do personal stuff from work, and work from home as well.<br><br>Thanks for the great idea.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>The stalagmite/stalactite method was originally designed in order to make it possible to separate work from home tasks for dismissal purposes. If you were at work, then only work tasks were in danger of dismissal. If you were at home, then only home tasks were in danger of dismissal.</div>

<div class="content">ubi:<br><br>One problem I can see is that you can do some tasks both at home and at work. How would you distinguish these? Otherwise you will still have to scan the whole page.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi - It wasn't my idea originally, but I certainly did use it most of the time I was doing AF1 (and AF4, too, if I remember right).<br><br>Mark - Yes, that's right.  I forgot to indicate that in my quick summary.  If you are at work, and nothing stands out on a page when you first come to it, then dismiss all the work tasks -- but leave the home tasks undismissed.  If you are at home, and nothing stands out on a page when you first come to it, then dismiss all the home tasks -- but leave the work tasks undismissed.  That's an important piece of the stalagmite / stalactite method -- thanks for the reminder, Mark.<br><br>Mark, you also wrote:<br><<<One problem I can see is that you can do some tasks both at home and at work. How would you distinguish these? Otherwise you will still have to scan the whole page. >>><br><br>My experience with that has been: When I come to a page and do that initial scan, I notice whether there is any urgent personal task on the "home" list that needs to be done today and is possible to be done from work.  With SAF, I can copy that task directly to the work half of Column 2, to make sure it gets done.  Then, after that initial scan, I can ignore the home section of the page while I actually work the tasks.<br><br>When the tasks are all mixed up together, you still have to read those home tasks every single time you pass through the list -- perhaps several times while you are on any given page.  It gets tedious, and can cause loss of focus.</div>

<div class="content">Mark asked, if I use the stalagmite/stalactite (S/S) method, and since I can do some tasks both at home and at work, how I would distinguish these, and noted that I would still have to scan the whole page. All true, but I think it will be tremendously helpful to have the contexts separated at the top & bottom of each page, with a dividing line. I often feel like I'm hunting for another work-related task to consider, and having all the personal/home stuff interspersed makes it a pain. Time will tell if the S/S method is really helpful. I'll get to my first new page tomorrow (Tue 16 Nov California time), and will report back within the next few days. I don't intend to dismiss half-pages, or write personal stuff at the top of the 2nd column (or vice-versa), as Seraphim suggests. Each page will still be considered as a unit. The only other modification I anticipate is that I will probably end up skipping over a page when it has only out-of-context tasks remaining, rather than dismissing all or part of it. The only real drawback I can think of is that I might hesitate sometimes in deciding where to write a new task, since I tend to blend my work/personal/home life. For example, I've been meaning to invite my colleague and former supervisor over for dinner, which is clearly a social/non-work function. But I think of him mainly at work, so it would be natural to contact him there. In this and other borderline cases, it doesn't really matter where on the page the task is put.</div>

<div class="content">I've also used the S/S method before.<br><br>Now with SAF/SF I've continued my main practice of the Work List starting at the front, turn the notebook (Moleskine Large = A5) upside dwon and run my Personal List from the back.<br><br>I have a couple of tags to locate my position on each list,<br><br>Yes, sometimes one has to refer to the Personal List when at work, and vice versa.  At the start of each day and when I review SAF/S, I might cross out a relevant personal task and rewrite it in the Work List, and again vice versa if necessary.<br><br>There's also no 11th Commandment that states, "Thou shalt not consult thy personal list when at work, or vice versa."<br><br>The Ten Commandments list is the first tablet/slate application to be recorded!</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>But is it not true that The Almighty makes sure we get reminders ('auto', via our innermost thoughts or conscience) when we have NOT done the Thou Shalt and similar tasks, and when we have done those tasks which we should not have done?  Perhaps the Lord's Prayer is a 'follow-up'?<br><br>As a fragile Christian, perhaps I should refrain from making such glib remarks!  Certainly there is evidence that there are more folk of stronger faith and conviction than moi on this forum.</div>

<div class="content">The 10 commandments make a very poor to do list.  "Thou shalt not steal" cannot be "done", because it's perpetual and continuous.  The 10 establish a framework for life within which we may do many different things.  Not that anybody always stays in the zone, but that it's a better thing so to do.<br><br>Likewise, though not on the same level as the 10 commandments, the SAF rules establish a framework of how to pick things to work on.  Just don't put "Rob bank" on your list if you aim to follow both rule sets.</div>

<div class="content">I wouldn't worry too much about home / work division.<br><br>That's not to say mix them all together, just recognize that no system can be perfect. Life isn't like that. Rather than never being happy with a system that won't do100% of the job, use one that works 95% of the time and allows us to do whatever is needed the rest of the time.<br><br>Mark's systems are good like that. They survive drops and are easy to reboot. They take very little maintenance. They admit that the planning mind is very bad at predicting what you'll actually be able to do at a given moment.<br><br>I'd put the "either place" tasks where they're most likely to be noticed when I can do them, with some consideration of where I'll see them if they're late.<br><br>Calling the doctor is usually done during business hours, so would go on a list I look at while at work. That means I need to be able to write on that list while at home.<br><br>The only time I'd rigidly separate them is confidentiality and/or need to share. Even then, that's usually at a project or calendar level.</div>

<div class="content">My own preferred solution to the Workplace/Home problem (which I don't often have to face myself) is two books. <br><br>The tasks should go in the book according to the location where they will be done, not whether they are work or personal. So in Cricket's example "Call Doctor" would go in the Workplace book.<br><br>If there are tasks which can be done either at home or at work, then they should be in both books.<br><br>If you want to keep your Home book at home and your Workplace book at work, then you can write selected home tasks on a piece of paper for work and enter them in your workplace book when you get there (and vice versa). That will also prevent the two locations spilling over into each other too much.</div>

<div class="content">I prefer the stalactite/stalagmite method over two books, because:<br><br>(1) For me, it's not so much about location as about focus.  I work from home most of the time, but still need to maintain focus on my work tasks during work hours.  <br><br>(2) I don't need double entry if the task can be done in either location, as is required if you use two books.<br><br>(3) On days (rarer and rarer) when there isn't so much pressure at work, I can be a little more flexible in my focus.  Having both tasks appearing on one page (but separated by a line) helps prompt me to "switch locations" as needed, by showing me the whole range of tasks that can be done, not just work.  Normally I just suppress the home tasks but on light work days I can lighten up on the suppression a bit.</div>

<div class="content">I work from home almost exclusively. The reason I want two books is that I don't want to be distracted when I am supposed to be working by home tasks and vice versa. I find it very easy to get really distracted either way (i.e. work when I should be relaxing, and doing home tasks when I should be working).</div>

<div class="content">I did that for a while (several years ago and long before AutoFocus) using TiddlyWiki.  It worked out quite well.  It was a little clunky, but that was maybe some of the attraction; it was somewhat of a game/test to see if I could beat it!  In the long run it helped me get a lot done.<br><br>For a project, I would never worry about a file format or long-term readability.  Projects are relatively short lived and MS Word will certainly outlive them.  And you can do all the other things such as links to files and web sites.  But it does seem so much more like work just using Word;  I don't know why.  Anything that makes managing your work look less like work itself is probably a good thing.</div>
