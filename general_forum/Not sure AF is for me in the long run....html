<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-26 14:11</div>
<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br><br>Well, I have tried to make AF work for some time now.  My implementation has been in OneNote with time-sensitive tasks in Outlook 2007.  But I am finding that perhaps this system -- while admittedly brilliant -- just does not fit my personality and work style.  Here is why.  I have so many projects with deadlines that a good portion of my tasks end up being better tracked in Outlook 2007 in a linear sequence manner rather than in long lists in AF.  I have used project-tracking software for my many projects with the tasks created and moved into Outlook.  But what I am finding is that I have two systems -- my time-sensitive tasks in Outlook and then my AF lists, which I try to engage in my "free" time.  Everyone always discusses the low overhead of AF -- and if you can incorporate your entire business portfolio of tasks in AF -- this may be the case.  But I am finding that I have to manage two almost separate task systems, and to me -- that is unnecessary overhead.<br><br>I will admit freely here that my personality type is one of structure and linear scheduling of tasks.  When I am asked if I can do a particular task or project, I like being able to look at my schedule and linear scheduling of my tasks -- and being able to state that I cannot this week or next because of my commitments.  When I have tried to have everything in AF, I have no sense of really what is on my plate because I am looking at long lists -- master lists if you will.  I really do miss DIT, which really fit my personality and workstyle better.  <br><br>Maybe I am the only one that feels that way.  It is amazing -- I almost feel guilty that I am an outlier.  There are so many here that have embraced AF and it seems to be almost a life-altering event.  I wish it was that way for me, and I have really tried over the last several weeks.<br><br>So...I think I am going to go back to either GTD or DIT as I am more comfortable with either of those.  I wish everyone here the best.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br>My GTD/DIT hybrid worked well for me.  Yet, this is my third attempt at autofocus because I want to experience what everybody is raving about.  I'll try to finish out the week or two to give autofocus a chance.  Yet, my GTD/DIT accomodated me really well.  I suppose that my disabilities are going force any system to be difficult to work.  Autofocus leaves me with the feeling of overwhelm, groping in the dark, fear of something falling through the cracks, etc....<br>I thought it was because of hard pain rattling my awareness and short-term memory loss not being able to work autofocus.  I feel QUITE RELIEVED that it might simply be basic differences in operational styles.  I've always prefered to both know what's on my plate and to both schedule it and prioritize it.  I always allowed flex time to accomodate both the unexpected events and to allow room for my inspirations.  <br>THANK YOU for posting this.  Although I'm not quite ready to give up autofocus because I believe that I feel compelled to give it a proper go of it,......if I can't make it work for me as well as my previous GTD/DIT hybrid (remarkably similar to Michael Linenberger's system)your post will aide me in not feeling like I've failed.  I don't know if it's because I've been using the basics of my methods for over 50 years, or it's origins are my genetically encoded predispositions.<br>I'm always willing to aim at possible improvements.  Right now, autofocus is quite difficult for me!  I think I'm FAR MORE productive when I have a target to aim at. (scheduling, reviewing, planning and prioritizing) and my progress and productivity is easier to measure.  With autofocus, I rarely remember what I actually accomplished.  The clock simply states that it's time to stop.  I'm sure that short-term memory use is a preresquisite of Autofocus's strength: structured procrastination.  I do better following a plan with flex time added.<br>Thank you, David.  It took guts to write this post. Failed experiments never feel good.  Never the less,  I'm sure Mark appreciates your efforts at trying autofocus.  It is simply an alternative method that he offered us to try.  I'm still hoping that it will work for me, yet I'm not very hopeful that it will work as well as my other method.  I've got to face up to my limitations and stop chasing after the silver bullet.  My other system was quite effective.  My disabilities are the spammer in the works....probably to any system I try!  *blush*(I don't know why I'm so unwilling to accept these limitations!  *blush*)<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi David, good to hear from you again. I feel similar to you in 2 respects - 1: After several attempts at AF I would also say that DIT suits my personality much better. For me, using AF as a system does not help fend off overwhelm in the way DIT does. 2: I also feel a bit of an 'outcast' on the Forum and am missing the past discussions re DIT. <br><br>I think it's a strength to be able to recognise which system does and doesn't work, depending on your personality, and I certainly feel much more relaxed and in control with DIT. <br><br>I am sure Mark will continue to reply to DIT queries and I certainly will. But for the moment I am choosing to skip over all the AF related discussion.</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go,<br><br>Thank you for YOUR post!  I am glad too to see that I am not alone in my feelings.  I guess my personality is one in which I need structure -- exactly as you have so elegantly described in terms of linear scheduling.  It has happened to me more than once with colleagues in meetings when we are discussing new projects, timelines for our grant studies, etc. -- and I cannot clearly describe what I really can or cannot do because of too much reliance in AF.  Again, it is a very good system -- and seems to be a godsend to so many here.  But it just does not seem to match my professional life or my personality.<br><br>Hang in there!  And best wishes!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I am having similar thoughts about the two systems.  If I have a pile of work to get through, none of which is due immediately, then Autofocus is ideal.  It allows me to move through long  lists of tasks, doing small amounts of work as I please. And I find that, over a period of days, an enormous amount of work gets done.<br>But then there are days like today. I have 3 student projects which I must review before my class at 6 p.m.  I have two business-related phone calls that I have to make.  I want to spend an hour on my own writing.  And I want to go to the gym.<br>With a day like this, DIT is perfect. It allows me to shut the door on other tasks and to work within this limited time frame to accomplish a very clear and specific series of tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>If you find certain methodologies of both GTD and DIT to offer more surety and success, then I whole heartedly recommend you visit Michael Linenberger's website or peruse his book "Totol Workday Control".  By coincidence, the system I developed for myself, is remarkedly similar.......yet his version is more refined and uses Outlook and he also offers a "skin" to further facilitate use of his system with Outlook.(though it's not at all a necessity to reap the benefits of his system)  It's both highly controlled, yet quite flexible as well. At the least, you might pick up a useful tweek. It combines principles and elements of both GTD and DIT Just my 2cents....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps Autofocus could have stayed in beta longer.<br><br>I am still using the system exactly as defined by Mark (except I use software) with high hopes.<br><br>I recently had a lot of unpredictable waiting time (jury service) and was able to use those periods extremely productively with AF.<br><br>On the flip side certain areas are less efficient than they were, I think the issues raised in this and other threads could be used to improve the system - the challenge is how to modify the design without it turning into two rival lists (which inevitably would turn in to one list).<br><br>Comments on the forum may not reflect performance, as those who drop out might comment less.<br><br>It would be useful to analyse degrees of success with AF according to the working environment of the user. Perhaps an anonymous survey form could be set up.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andy,<br><br>No, I have not tried AF with just pen and paper.  I am a very digital person and have had a digital setup for some years.  I see no reason to go back to pen and paper.  Now, with that said, of course I like to doodle and plan on paper some.  But I like my Outlook 2007 system, my entire calendar is there (and has to be due to my administrative roles), and therefore it works well for me to have my task management there as well.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Seems to me that if anyone wants linear scheduling of tasks, then AF would not be for them.<br><br>That said, I think that a combination of Outlook and One Note is a cumbersome way of tackling AF. Especially as Outlook is pretty unsophisticated as a Task Manager. I have lots of scheduled tasks and lots of deadlined tasks and frequently very little discretionary time. But I don't have any problems in using AF. Scheduled tasks obviously have to be kept in a Calendar/Diary prog whether it be Outlook or an alternative.<br><br>If you cannot depend on getting around to deadlined tasks in AF, then you do need to flag deadline dates so that tasks can be put into the calendar if the deadline approaches. I use AbstractSpoon's ToDoList to operate AF, This allows me to put in dates which makes it easy to see tasks with impending deadlines; regular review means that I pretty much know where I am. If I am concerned I might have missed something it is easy to see which tasks are coming up in whatever number of days I want to check. There are many other progs that allow this.<br><br>So, altogether nearly all my tasks are in AF and only scheduled tasks are in the calendar.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>Please don't give up posting on the forum - I've really found your thoughts and experiences helpful and thought provoking.  I'm really sorry you haven't got on so well with AF, not because I think it is the be all and end all but because I know from your comment "I wish it was that way for me, and I have really tried over the last several weeks." that you would really have liked it to work.<br><br>I'm sure you are right in that AF will not suit everybody, in the same way that GTD does not. I have to say I have a real admiration for the way in which you are so obviously able to work with a structured approach - I have always wanted to be able to do that but it was never a skill I found easy, which is why I find AF such a refreshing approach and I suspect is why I took to it so easily. Pete's idea of scheduling discretionary time sound like a good idea - maybe you will be able to find a corner for AF incorporated into your system!<br><br></div>

Good to see that you are trying another approach.<br><br>I think trying to find the best way of adding/amending AF to meet our own needs is not straightforward because Mark has tested it and refined it over a much longer period than we have had. Also using digital solutions is problematic because they aren't designed for this use, all have different attributes and we all have different needs and priorities. All I'd really say is that I'm sure it can be done though some/many people may be better off with a paper or part-paper solution.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-8 11:28</div>
<div class="content">I too struggle with AF - have been since near the beginning of the beta period.  I think the reasons are as follows:<br><br>(a) There is a lot that I need to do urgently.  So I spend a lot of time doing stuff with looming deadlines out of the AF sequence.  So it is difficult to carve out time to tackle the AF list.<br>(b) There is other stuff that does not have to be completed now, but nevertheless needs attention more frequently than I can be sure of cycling through the entire list.  <br><br>Of course, the more time you spend doing stuff outside the system, the more the system itself is undermined.  I end up having a "to do today" list that sits alongside the AF list (a post-it note equivalent of Mark's index card,  and the "to do today" list grows to fill the whole day.   <br><br>This is not a satisfactory state of affairs.  It leaves me vulnerable to forgetting about things I need to do for longish periods of time, with consequent dropped catches.  <br><br>I suppose I need to go on trying hard to find time for AF, and also to push myself to cycle through the pages quickly - though even such "pushing" feels like a distortion of the system.  <br><br>I really do wonder whether the system works best for people with a preponderance of larger projects with longer deadlines.  In my line of work there is a lot of stuff - some small, some large - that needs to be turned round quickly.  <br><br>James</div>

<div class="content">James,<br>I feel for you. However, any time management system requires some discipline and determination. I recently posed the question of what is discretionary time and received a few useful replies. You may find it useful to refer to that thread.<br>If what you write about (a) and (b) above is totally and wholly true, then no system is going to create more time for you. It's up to you to evaluate your priorities and make your own choices. AF is a tool that will help you to enforce task completion, always provided that you are committed to doing or, ultimately, dismissing the tasks concerned.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-8 14:19</div>
<div class="content">James:<br><br>I've been using AF for more than three months now and increasingly I find that I can trust the system to deliver things on time, even if they are things which need to be done the same day that I receive them. So I don't find it necessary to have a "same day" list. Tasks like "Comments", "Email" etc, I now do several times a day, following the system to the letter.<br><br>Tasks which need to be done immediately obviously should just be done immediately. No problem.<br><br>So I would keep your separate list purely for tasks which have a genuinely short time period in which you know that you are not realistically going to reach them using the list. You should always regard this as the exception rather than the rule. There should never be more than one or two tasks on it - and usually none.<br><br>I am assuming here that all your urgent tasks are genuinely urgent, and not just urgent because you haven't got around to doing them before they became urgent.</div>

<div class="content">Mark said that even tasks that he does several time a day, he puts in AF. <br><br>Please help me understand this. As I see it, this is realistic only under two conditions:<br><br>1. You cycle through the list "several times a day", or<br>2. You have very few active pages and spend most of your time on the last page.<br><br>It is not realistic if I only cycle through all my active pages once in a day. And it won't happen at all if I don't make even one cycle in a day.<br><br>If my analysis above is correct--and I welcome those who would explain any errors in my analysis--then part of the AF learning process is the development of new habits. Call it intuition, or call it something else, but you will have to develop new habits if you are going to cycle through all your pages multiple times per day.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Moises, <br><br>I'm wondering if it's possible for Mark (and for me at work) to do the cycling through once a day or more because we didn't start with a backlog?  Mark because he was probably on top of his work before he started using AF, and me because I started a new job on the first day of beta testing.  <br><br>There is absolutely no way I could cycle through all the pages on my home list in one day on my home list which has 25 or so active pages with 2 hours maximum of discretionary time.<br><br>At work, I only have about 7-8 active pages, and I go through them about 3 times a day, spending more time on the last page.  That's about 10-15 minutes average that can be spent on each task.  That amount seems right to me for the average knowledge worker.<br><br>I seem to recall in one of Mark's early posts, he mentioned he did 60+ tasks in a day, which amounts to an average of about 10 minutes assuming a work/home day of 10 hours.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline & moises<br><br>I did start with a backlog and think that definitely has an impact.  That backlog includes things which have an urgency because they weren't originally done at the right time, but which are of such a size that they will not disappear for some time.  As a result I cannot go through my pages every day and the regular review is vital for me.  I do get anxious about my "problem" items but every time I try to action them outside of the system in any way, shape or form, the end result is an increase in stress and a feeling of relief when I return to "pure" AF.<br><br>For me I just need to live with the fact that I have backlog issues, and will continue to have them until cleared.  They are issues that I cannot - or choose not to - dismiss so will have an impact in the meantime.  However, and most importantly - I am not building up a significant "new backlog".  I have had "new backlogs" form within AF but they have been part of the process, where AF was identifying factors surrounding those tasks, perhaps reasons for resistance, or a need to modify the system for handling them.<br><br>Lack of discretionery time is also something I have to accept - at least until I can perhaps put systems in place to manage areas that rely solely on my availability at short notice.  I think it's sometimes a case that the old adage holds true "the impossible we do [AF does] at once, miracles take a little longer!"</div>

<div class="content">David, I don't think there's anything wrong with liking the structure of DIT. I am a very creative person, easily distracted, and averse to too much structure. I think one of the reasons you see so many people on this forum shouting Hallelujah is that most time management approaches are created by structure-loving people. I have long detested my inability to mold myself to these approaches that work so well for the naturally organized. AF is a real breakthrough for me because it works with my natural style, rather than against it. <br><br>For example, I never, ever have one project going at a time. DIT advised this and I really wanted to work that way so I could be organized, but I just couldn't do it. I read maybe 6 books at a time. I cook, I clean, I teach, I speak, I write, I lead, I scrapbook, I run programs, etc., etc. I tried and tried to figure out which of my commitments to give up and the truth is I want to give up none of them! With AF, I don't have to, at least not formally. But after many passes through a page when certain tasks are left orphaned, I know that I just can't take care of them. I didn't have to decide not to do them consciously; it just happened that I wasn't able to. If circumstances change, and they often do, I will end up doing some of those tasks. But I do them without the guilt and stress that more structured approaches create in me.<br><br>I was just at a very organized neighbor's home yesterday taking care of her dog while she is away. I told my husband how neat as a pin her house is. My husband started trying to make excuses for me why my house doesn't look quite as neat. I told him to stop. I know that her organizing skills are a gift and I actually just enjoyed seeing someone else do what I am not able to. I dare say that she would feel the same way if she came to my home and saw the school and writing and church projects underway all at once--commitments she doesn't feel she wants to or is able to take on. <br><br>So if you're not celebrating AF, maybe that's because you already have reason to celebrate: your approach works beautifully for you. Don't change it! But do continue on this forum as sharing between different styles can be a blessing for all.</div>

You spend most of one day on the last 2 or 3 pages and after crossing off and re-entering some recurrent tasks you actually revisit the same task a few times.<br><br>So it is not quite true that you would have to "spend most of your time on the last page".<br><br>However, the spirit of what you say is accurate enough.  (Let us note, however, that some members of the forum actually make "multiple entries" of the same item so that they have the opportunity to reach that item more often.)<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">JIm:<br><br>Possiblility no. 3 is definitely what has happened to me. I spend most of my time chasing the end of the list, and only revisit the the earlier pages once every two or three days. I find this works just fine.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>What don't I understand? <br><br>I don't see how you can spend time on just the last page and still get much done on the second to the last page if you only see it every 2-3 days.  If you are spending most of a day on the second to last page, how do you get a same-day task done that is on the last page?  <br><br>I also thought you have said that you cycle through the whole list at least daily.   Obviously, I am confused.</div>

<div class="content">MartyH<br><br>If I can attempt to answer for Mark:<br><br>1. Earlier in this forum Mark did say that he got through the list once or twice a day, but he has reported on a couple of occasions that this is now often not the case.<br><br>2. Mark did not actually say that he only went back to the second to last page every 2 or 3 days.  He was saying that he shared my experience of spending a lot of time on the last 2 or 3 pages.  (the "earlier' pages he was referring to might well be some 8 or 10 pages back.)<br><br>3. Don't worry about it until you experience it.  But if you want a theoretical explanation of how this happens, just imagine a situation where the list is growing about the same pace as you are working through the pages and you are about a page or so behind the end of the list.  That way you might have the experience that Mark describes, i.e. "chasing the end of the list" (but not necessarily reaching it more that once every 2 or 3 days.)<br><br>4. As you point out, this is less likely to happen when there are some "urgent' things on a page you are not spending a lot of your time on, but if you are that close to the end of the list anyway this rarely seems to present a problem.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">MartyH<br><br>Jim is correct, and don't forget the "just do it" rule - if something needs to be done same day you "just do it".  Then you can just cross it off the list when you get to that page :-)</div>

<div class="content">MartyH:<br><br>Jim is correct in his explanation of what I said. If you are working on the 2nd to last page, by the time you have finished working on it, the last page may have filled up and so it is now the 2nd to last page.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all.  I was concerned that if you weren't cycling through the list at least daily, that you couldn't depend on it for same day tasks without one of the "hacks".  The one I have used is writing same day tasks on a Post-It note attached to my bookmark so they are treated like part of the current page.  While that helps with the comfort level, I want to avoid it if it really isn't needed.  Something like "Trust, but verify".</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>One possible way might be to add any same-day tasks to the end of the list, then write 'do some work on same day tasks' on the bookmark.<br><br>When there are no more same day tasks that 'stand out', just go back to the bookmarked page.<br><br>cheers,<br>Pete.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Pete<br><br>I like the idea of a task to action same day items - if they genuinely need doing they will stand out - if not that should help us to question our resistance ........... Thanks for that idea :-)</div>
