<div class="content">From the SuperFocus Rules:<br><br>"Dismissal is where the system finally gets rid of all the items which the system has sifted and found wanting. ...<br><br>These tasks are no longer active, but subject to review.<br><br>...Highlighting rejected items helps you to review them easily.<br><br>...b. When a task is dismissed it is highlighted.<br><br>c. When a dismissed task is reviewed and either reinstated or removed altogether, it is crossed out as it is no longer subject to review."<br><br>I am STILL resisting dismissing items. I think the highlighting step is what I'm really resisting. Mark wrote that highlighting items helps them stand out to be reviewed. To me, highlighting them calls attention to some kind of failure on my part. I know, that's my issue, not the system's, but I've finally realized that it's the highlighting that I don't like. <br><br>The items that I have dismissed, I've by-passed the highlighting step and just moved it to my 'Dismissed from SF' list in OmniFocus. <br><br>Even if I highlighted and then crossed out, that highlighting would still taunt me. <br><br>Any thoughts to help me get over this, or any alternatives that don't bend the rules too much?</div>

<div class="content">I resisted dismissal for a long time also, but now I think it's fun!   Last night I was really looking forward to dismissing a page full of tasks and was disappointed that one of those tasks stood out.  :-(<br><br>The dismissal feature provides opportunities for growth, for process improvement, for goals clarification, and the like, far more than any other single feature of the SF system.  <br><br>For some reason, the one single thing that helped me transition from resistance to acceptance of dismissal, was one of Mark's posts.    He was sick with the flu, and either didn't feel like doing the things on the page, or just physically couldn't.   And so he was dismissing with abandon.   That insight into how Mark works with dismissal really clicked with me -- dismissal is not some kind of failure -- it's a reflection of your current set of priorities, your current state of mind, your current state of health, your current work-life balance, and lots of other things.   Dismissal, when you really start using it, helps your intuition speak more clearly.  <br><br>I suppose the main difference now is that I used to look at it as "Oh no, now I've got to figure out how to change my work processes so I can get all those dismissed items done -- and I don't know how in the world I can squeeze out any more efficiency".   And that made me feel depressed.   "This is never going to work."   <br><br>But now I look forward to dismissal and reviewing the dismissed items, because it always gives me so many new insights.  In the end makes me feel so much better about my work, my work-life balance, and whether or not I am achieving the results that really matter in my life.<br><br>Not sure if any of this helps.  I'm still not quite sure what helped me make that transition...</div>

<div class="content">I don't like using a highlighter for dismissed tasks, either. To me, highlighter means important. Also, I like to tear out, scrunch up and throw out finished pages. (Yes, small things amuse small minds.)<br><br>Some information is lost with the rewrite method, though. With highlighting, I always know when I first wrote it down. That's easy enough to fix by the date as I copy it. Another benefit is I know when I admitted that now is not the time, and I can see how often a project bounces between active and dismissed. If it happens frequently, I ask hard questions.<br><br>Things still get dismissed, I just indicate it in a different way.</div>

<div class="content">I do like the highlighter, for the simple reason that it makes the dismissed tasks easy to find.   I like keeping them there, on the pages where they were living when they got dismissed, because it helps me remember the context -- when and why they got dismissed.  And that helps with the reflection later, when I am considering whether to re-enter the task.<br><br>I guess I never really attached any connotations to the fact that I was highlighting something.  It just serves a practical purpose.</div>

<div class="content">Malisa,<br><br>I too felt very uncomfortable with dismissing at first. I'd strongly recommend just going ahead and dismissing a few pages a few times.<br><br>I often have to remind myself that that it is dismissal that brings the "Focus" to Superfocus.</div>

<div class="content">A highlighted task on a page means "Don't even look at this page, let alone this task because it's been dismissed and you are working now! But if you happen to read the task, that's okay no biggie."  Later when you're doing the Review dismissed, the highlighed pages will make it easy to find them, the highlighted tasks make it easy to find them, and when a page is finally done (highlighted tasks deleted, maybe reentered), cross it or crease it so you never need to consider it again.<br><br>This should not feel like a problem.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan<br>'A highlighted task on a page means "Don't even look at this page, let alone this task"...<br>This should not feel like a problem.'<br><br>I have been conditioned all my life to think of highlighters as highlighting something important. They draw attention, they don't signal 'ignore for now'. <br><br>I have highlighted 28 tasks across 5 pages. I'll review them tomorrow. We'll see how I feel about having the items highlighted and not crossed out and then crossed out. Since I'm nearing the end of my book and will have to move to a new one fairly soon, I figure it is the perfect time to try to do this by the rules. <br><br>I still, at this time, wish there was another way to anti-highlight something, other than a highlighter.</div>

<div class="content">Malisa:<br><br>What kind of mark would create a feel-good state around dismissal? <br><br>It seems to me you need to associate dismissal with clarity and confidence in what you are about - a "this is not who I am or what I want" marker. Or maybe two: "not what I'm about NOW" and a "not who I am EVER". Or perhaps change the name from "dismissal" to "irrelevant" or "unwanted" or "not preferred". Perhaps that is a gentler or more accepting attitude to unwanted activity, or a way of rewarding focus on the preferred. <br><br>Perhaps marking these tasks with a "N" for "Nope, Not me" for example. (After a week I suppose one gets a clearer self-image by looking back at all the "N"s)</div>

<div class="content">Malisa:<br><br>Dismissed tasks are highlighted not just so that you can find them again but because they ARE important. "Dismissed" in this context means the same as in "Class dismissed". You have finished with them for the moment, but you expect them back again soon!<br><br>Tasks that you have dismissed are those which the system has decided should be reviewed. This reviewing is a very important part of getting the phrasing and level of tasks and projects right, as well as keeping the whole system (i.e. your life) focussed.<br><br>It probably wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that dismissal is the most essential part of SuperFocus, giving the whole system its bite and focus. As such the dismissed tasks deserve to be highlighted!</div>

<div class="content">I would amend Mark's comment, to say that the act of dismissing particular tasks is important, rather than any one of the specific tasks being of importance. It's telling you something about yourself or your circumstances, that you listed something to do and failed to take action on it. The anxiety you feel by using the highlighter is real, and necessary to get through. It means that you are taking the process seriously, and (it is hoped) learning how to plan and do things better in the future.</div>

<div class="content">malisa, I have some of the same concerns as you. To keep the highlighted tasks from grabbing my attention, I use a blue highlighter instead of the typical yellow one. (For clarity, blue is the only color I use in my SF list.) I'm used to seeing yellow highlighting for important stuff. Blue is a more subdued color and doesn't trigger the "HEY LOOK" reaction from me.<br><br>I also have deep reservations about dismissing items. When I write down a task, I feel like I have a responsibility to DO that task. I struggle with that feeling when I dismiss something because my first reaction is that I've not lived up to my responsibility. Will Mark's "class dismissed" analogy help me with that attitude? I hope so, and I hope that his and others' comments help you as well.</div>

<div class="content">I like the idea of a lowlighter!<br><br>Those grey markers would still stand out enough that you can find them quickly when reviewing dismissed items, but possibly bypass my long-ingrained reaction of "highlighted bits are important."<br><br>"It is not you who failed to do the task: it is the task that failed to convince you that it deserves your focus." I like that!</div>

<div class="content">Will wrote: "Remember that the tasks on your list are not committed until you do some work on them. It is not you who failed to do the task: it is the task that failed to convince you that it deserves your focus."<br><br>Interesting deflection. But I will still take responsibility, even if it's my intuitive side that resulted in a task not calling itself out to be done.  However you want to phrase it, I came to the page and chose not to take action on a remaining task.  So the page gets dismissed.  When reviewing these highlighted tasks, I will strive to face up to the true situation, and try to work it so that I'm not entering a lot more tasks that are destined for dismissal.</div>

<div class="content">ubi:<br><br>I want to stress again that dismissal is part of the normal process of SuperFocus and not something that's telling you to take responsibility, or that you failed to take action on something, or that you need to face up to the real situation. <br><br>Although I don't intend to get fussy about the colour of marker that anyone uses, to me the message that a lowlighter would give is that you have something to hide or be ashamed of.<br><br>Dismissal does not in any way, shape or form imply that you have failed or that you shouldn't have put the task(s) in question on your list. It is one of the normal ways in which tasks get processed - and as such it is the individual tasks that are important.<br><br>I repeat: it is part of the normal process of SuperFocus. This is so important that I am going to repeat it once more:<br><br>DISMISSAL IS PART OF THE NORMAL PROCESS OF SUPERFOCUS.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for all the discussion. I like the idea of any color BUT yellow since it has the most mojo for me that seems inconsistent with the dismissal process. (See how I stepped around certain words there?) <br><br>I've already used yellow this time, but I'll try blue or orange next time. <br><br>Today was a day trip out and about. The 'vacation' day of my vacation. <br><br>The remaining three days of my vacation must be productive. I'm ready to hit the ground running tomorrow!</div>

<div class="content">I like "class dismissed"!<br><br>Dismissal already felt pretty comfortable to me, but I have still viewed it as "debugging," i.e., "what went wrong?"<br><br>"Class dismissed" brings it down another notch. Food for thought. Thanks, Mark!<br><br>Since we are talking about pens and such, I may as well report that my yellow highlighter smears my black pen. Drat!</div>

<div class="content">Joining this thread after a couple of days away from the forum, here's my penny's worth.<br><br>In the early days of AF,  I used a number of highlighter colours to differentiate tasks.<br><br>I also thought that the colours would distract me and that i would also struggle to find the undone tasks difficult to pick up among the strike-throughs of completed tasks.<br><br>However, I found that I have adjusted fine and that the strike-throughs become 'blurred' as I scan the page seeking the 'untouched' and undone tasks.  And I also find that my orange-highlighted dismissed tasks do not stand out until I consciously look for them on a review session of dismissals.<br><br>AF - SF is still be best technique for me.</div>

<div class="content">Picking up Ubi's point on responsibility, which has been nagging away at me.<br><br>Of course we must take responsibility for our actions. In terms of SF, this means:<br>- getting a rich set of options into C1<br>- getting through what's on the list<br>- persisting with C2 actions until they are done and<br>- dismissing the right C1 entries so that you are working off a focused action list</div>
