<div class="content">Hi David<br>I think Mark's a Roman Catholic.  Today is Shrove Tuesday (last day before Lent)   It's also called.......Fat Tuesday and Mardi Gras(French for Fat Tuesday). Maybe he's making and eating pancakes galore!  It's called pancake day. Everybody has to get rid of their milk, butter and eggs and fresh meat.  (There was no refrigeration  He might be feasting and partying before tomorrow's Lenten fast .........AND..........40 days plus Sundays of observing Lent (until Easter Day).  I live alone...but I've been cooking and eating like there's no tomorrow!  LOL!<br>Again, I'm only guessing why Mark's been away these last few days. <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br>I'm not an official practicing Roman Catholic but I do love observing Lent.  I still haven't chosen my sacrifice for Lent yet.  Many years it actually sticks and becomes a part of me and sometimes when Easter rolls around I'm GLAD that I can go back to my lesser self!  *blush*  Just so long as not too many people I have soot on my forhead......lol!  (For non Catholics, it's the ashes from last years, Palsm Sunday leaves and the priest blesses us.  From what I've been taught, it's a great beginning.  It displays our humility which strengthens our resolve. I won't go into the entire Religious aspects...but it's quite wonderful for enriching our spirit and character even for waffling heathens such as me!  ROTFL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike!<br>Sunday I bought a gallon of milk, a dozen eggs, a pound of butter, 4 porterhouse steaks and 2 pounds of shrimp.  I made recipes using it all up to imitate the days before the fast.  Believe me, Missy loved eating Porterhouse steak while I stuffed my belly on steamed spice shrimp and cobbler puddings (That's as close as I came to making pancakes!  *blush*) Now a days people might think I'm daft if I deliver them stacks of pancakes.  ROTFL!  Cobbler is better for the sharing part of it!  I don't want to get "observed" for 72 hours because I made piles of pancakes!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br>I wish I could email you some!  I love to share my cooking!  It's one of the few things that I can do well anymore!  *blush*   I can't take full credit as I base much of my cooking on old family recipes as well as a few I've developed  strictly on my own.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I've heard of pancakes through the mail but never pancakes via e-mail (I guess you can send them as an attachment but the file would be very big!)</div>

<div class="content">Mark may just be on holiday, or have family committments.  Over here in the UK it is half term from school so all the children are at home for the week.  Often parents have jobs so grandparents often step in the help out.<br><br>Alternatively he may just be having a well earned break from the forum while he leaves us all to get on with things!<br><br>On the subject of pancakes - my husband cooked up some 'american pancakes' (the thicker ones) for us last night which we had with maple syrup and ice cream.  On teh striaght and narrow today!<br><br>Also - can I point out that it isn't just Catholics that observe Lent - Church of England do as well.</div>

<div class="content">I do hope it is family commitments or he is on holiday.  Or maybe he is working on modifications to DWM.   I just hope he is okay....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">We all hope this of course.  But if Mark is following his system, he's allowed a full week before he needs to get back to responding to our inquiries.  It could even be longer.  Give him time.</div>

<div class="content">Thought I would bump this up to the top.  Mark, I do hope you are well.  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I think Mark is just taking a little vacation from the forum, as he has done before. He published two facebook updates on Friday, one of them linking to a youtube video showing him singing in a gospel choir on Valentine's day: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NsbRVK5aQc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NsbRVK5aQc</a><br><br>So he seems to be fine.</div>

<div class="content">I must say: (1) They are pretty good singers. and (2) Mark still has his red sweater and white shirt :-)</div>

<div class="content">I reckon he is letting us get on with testing the new system (which I have yet to start!!!).  There were lots of questions, so perhaps he felt that letting us figure it out was a better option.<br><br>Or as I said earlier he is just taking a holiday!</div>
