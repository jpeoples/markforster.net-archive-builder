<div class="content">Hi all - I have only been using AF for a few of days....oh the relief! But this is in part because I wasn't using any system at all before....even though I've read and loved all of Mark's books!....the shame of it :(  <br>But AF has been so easy to get going with I can relax a bit knowing tasks are being captured and will be processed. So my next problem is how to handle projects. I've read the threads on the forum....but am feeling confused with too many suggestions and ideas. Basically I am starting a new business and want to paper base my planning and project management. As I work from home I feel most of my time is discretionary so will add a task to my AF list  'Do next new business item/action'. <br>I will re-read DIT but if there are any other suggestions on how to get going quickly that would be fab. Thanks. Great forum by the way.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Emma<br><br>AF is an amazing system and it's great that you've started it at the same time as starting your new business.  Best advice re Time Management I can give you is to use AF, but I guess you've sussed that one :-)  Project Management on the other hand is a whole other issue, and if you are starting a new business the earlier you can get a handle on what you need for your specific business the better.  You mention that you want to "paper base" your planning and project management but although there are some simple strategies that can be applied to project planning as a whole, it sounds like you might need some more specific advice.<br><br>If you wish, you can email me directly at mail@meovoto.co.uk and I'll be happy to try to help you.  Alternatively if you can give a few more details about exactly what areas you need help with then I'm sure we can all come up with some more ideas and hopefully cut through the confusion for you :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Christine, but lordy I wouldn't want to take up your private time. I'm reading DIT again to reacquaint myself with the key ideas. Starting a business seems to require 1001 tasks that don't neccessarily need to be done in a linear sequence so I was thinking of using a separate AF list for it so I can go round the various sections frequently; eg. marketing ideas and actions, product development, financials, vision and goals (so I reconnect with these regularly). <br>I'm an artist and seem to have an allergy to spreadsheets! I trust my intuition quite a lot and love the simplicity of AF. So if  I have the new business as my current initiative as per DIT, a task on my master AF list called 'New Business' so I don't skip it. I know it's been suggested to keep only one list, but I feel like keeping it separate. I guess all I can do is have a go and tweek it as I go along.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Emma<br><br>The offer is genuinely there if you ever want to bounce ideas around so do feel free at any time.  You are right about 1001 tasks - there's so much to think about, from statutory requirements, to marketing, to producing your "product".  Whilst I find that working from home lends itself perfectly to a one list AF approach I would suspect that your intuition regarding a separate New Business list is actually spot on.  Although my own project management system has always included project specific task lists, since starting AF those project lists have been "converted" to mini AF lists, which then are handled either as part of a project time block or by means of the individual items being included within AF.<br><br>Using DIT, that would lend itself well to the Current Initiative concept, although as I recall the use of the Current Initiative approach itself would primarily be to get the project up and running as opposed to completing everything.  My feeling is that by producing a specific AF task list for "New Business" that will enable you to get all of your thoughts in the one place, and to use the intuitive creativity of AF to move it forward, perhaps within Current Initiative style time blocks.  Personally I have gone away from the Current Initiative concept of "the first thing every day" as for me that was too structured but that is me - others on the firum definitely do well with that structure.  I am more likely to put "New Business" as a task and then action the specific "New Business" AF list when the task stood out.  <br><br>I find Mindmapping is a good tool for creative thinking (and much more fun than spreadsheets!)  I do wish you all the best with your new venture.  One piece of advice - do remember to have fun with your business - if you get too bogged down in all of the detail it can strangle creativity but from my experience so far AF is a great tool for guarding against that!</div>
