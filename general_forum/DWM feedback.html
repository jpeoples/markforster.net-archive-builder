<div class="content">As I gather we are still beta testing DWM, here's my assessment.<br><br>The new dismissal rules have cracked the issue of the list which expands faster than it is processed. Mine went quickly up to 150 and then dropped to a steady 120-ish items which has been the list length for several weeks.<br><br>A caveat - I have found it necessary to use an electronic system for easy filtering by place. I can see a case for carrying paper and pen for quickly jotting down things for later re-entry.<br><br>While in a sense DWM is DIT, I have also found it to be AF, as the things which do not get deleted become apparent, over time, as the items of focus.</div>

<div class="content">I recently took a 2 week unexpected break from both my home & work DWM lists. Getting back on track was much easier than I'd expected. <br><br>I reviewed the pages I missed and crossed out whatever got done 'offlist'. The stuff that was left, if it was something that was now time-urgent, I added it to a 'must do today' short list. Everything else was dismissed per DWM rules.<br><br>I added new stuff on either +30 or +7. I don't usually add new stuff to +7, but I was catching up the list so anything that was in progress while I was offlist I added to +7. Everything else went to +30. <br><br>Pages between yesterday (well, yesterday when I went through the list) and +30 didn't get changed. I didn't re-number or re-date the pages. I reviewed them to refresh my memory about what's on the list and I did cross-out whatever got done (and re-adding them to +7 as needed).</div>

<div class="content">I am using paper, but do the dismissal part much like you describe if I have been forced off-list for one or more days.  <br><br>Depending on whether I am actively working on clearing items from one of the pages that are up for dismissal, I occasionally give myself the latitude to let a page or two not get dismissed rather than rewriting to a "must do today" list.  It lets me just work through the backlog without that distraction.<br><br>I try to keep this to only days when I have been forced off the list for some unexpected reason.  But there have been times when I have worked through some items on yesterday's page that was up for dismissal prior to dismissing the rest of the page.  <br><br>As long I don't let this get out of hand, it seems to make me feel like I am in control of the list instead of the other way around.  I still dismiss many more items than in the other AF systems and don't seem to get as bogged down.</div>
