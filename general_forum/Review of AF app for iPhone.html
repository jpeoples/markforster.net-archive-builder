<div class="content">For those interested in a AF app for the iPhone, you might want to read my review of an app called FocusTodo.  See <a href="http://filsalustri.wordpress.com/2010/02/12/focustodo-autofocus-for-the-iphone/" rel="nofollow">http://filsalustri.wordpress.com/2010/02/12/focustodo-autofocus-for-the-iphone/</a><br>I have no connection to the makers of FocusTodo.</div>

<div class="content">One sentence summary: It exactly simulates how you'd do AF in a 3" paper notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Worth mentioning: FocusPad is another iPhone app for Autofocus users (I am the author). A new version is coming out soon with multiple lists and ticklers.</div>

<div class="content">@ Tony,<br><br>Any news on the planned update?<br><br>The basic version works fine but greyed out items are not easy to read and the multiple list capability and ticklers is what I really bought it for.<br><br>Also any plans to accommodate different versions of AF/DWM?<br><br>Look forward to your update.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike and Wooba.<br><br>A new version of FocusPad is recently out with multiple pads and ticklers. This makes the app a lot more flexible. These features are supported in the iPhone version and the web version.<br><br>The gray todos are purposefully very light so they blend into the page and don't distract from active todos. Is this a problem for you on the web version, the iPhone version, or both?<br><br>The next major release of FocusPad will support DWM directly, by allowing you to create "dated" pages and automatically place new and duplicated todos on the correct page based on your preferences. I do not have a release date yet.<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">Hi Tony,<br><br>I am using the app on an off, but currently I'm back to paper and pen as it suits my current workload better at the moment.<br><br>I would like the gray todos to be a bit darker -- perhaps the colour could be configurable?<br><br>Also, it would be nice to be able to choose the number of lines on a page.<br><br>But I love the app, and will be back with it soon, especially if DWM is implemented.<br><br>Keep up the good work!</div>

<div class="content">Wooba,<br><br>I will add configurable colors to my queue of feature requests.<br><br>FocusPad 2.0 will have much more flexible paging arrangements, including the DWM support. Maybe I can woo you back from paper... :-)<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">You can certainly woo me, when DWM support is out. Don't forget the 4 bookmarks!</div>

<div class="content">Will, could you tell me more about the bookmarks? I must have missed something.<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">Will means the four bookmarks one can use to mark the four significant places in the list (the first active page, the current page, the week page and the month page). In a digital implementation of dwm, the week and month page bookmarks are not needed, since the software can take care of where to (re-)add a task (some people may want to be able to quickly jump to these places anyway, to take care of new tasks). Likewise, the bookmark for the first active page is only necessary if the software doesn't remove expired tasks from the list. What is left is remembering where you currently are on the list, which Focuspad already does.</div>

<div class="content">Exactly as Ben said.<br><br>My preference would be for the expired tasks to be left on the system so they could be checked later if necessary.</div>
