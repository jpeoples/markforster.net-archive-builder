<div class="content">For those who have participated in this 40 day challenge before, what is it that caused you to fail?  What special effort did it take to succeed?  What do you think it will take to make this year's effort a success?</div>

<div class="content">Greasing the wheel Alan... good stuff. <br><br>Last year, I was already engaged with my system before the challenge began (Is that cheating?). As well, I believe there was a thread where some of us were checking in... at times daily. That helped as well. Finally, I wanted to use the scaffolding of the challenge to see what I'd learn by sticking to one system, no innovations, for a set time period.</div>

<div class="content">This reminds me of the idea of a project “pre-mortem”. Imagine that Lent is already over, and you failed the Lenten Challenge. What are the things that went wrong? What caused these things to happen?<br><br>Now come back to today, when none of those things have happened yet. What can you do to reduce the risk of those negative things occurring? What can you do now to counter-act whatever caused the failure?<br><br><a href="http://www.riskology.co/pre-mortem-technique/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.riskology.co/pre-mortem-technique/</a></div>

<div class="content">The first risk of course is trying to work an untested system for 40 days. If the system is flawed it will fail. If it doesn’t fit you it will fail. Therefore trying in advance isn’t cheating. However, if it is the system you’ve used with success for 3 years straight, this clearly isn’t a challenge for you. <br><br> I have a tendency to drop a thing when it stops feeling shiny new and scratches and dents suow up.   Although actually that.tendency only applies to systems, not any other things. (Yet this does extend to non-task-oriented systems. ). I have at times stuck with a process for many months albeit with occasional lapses, but a solid success has never coincided with a Lenten challenge.  So the challenge for me is very real. <br><br>I have been striving hard to stick to my current system for many months, with mixed success (of sticking to it) and with much evolving as I aim for something that works well. I doubt I would have had any possibility of success much before now, but at this point I have a glimmer of hope.  To be clear, I consider my present system successful, but my consistency slightly less so.</div>

<div class="content">I think it may help my cause to spend more time each day contemplating. Free of distraction and stimulating input, reset my thinking patterns and re imagine how the coming time ought to be spent.</div>
