<div class="content">An interesting piece on the psychology behind habits and to-do list apps. I'm not sold on the solution i.e. any.do, but absolutely agree that a coaching/nudging/learning component is key for engagement. I'm not into the online marketing shtick of Simpleology - <a href="http://www.simpleology.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simpleology.com/</a> - but I dig how they're incorporating learning into their productivity suite.<br> <br><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3010346/work-smart/when-do-apps-become-rituals#2" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.fastcompany.com/3010346/work-smart/when-do-apps-become-rituals#2</a></div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Actually the solution, according to the article, is to make one's task management system into a "ritual", a habit that gives structure to one's life by anchoring every day to a tried and proven way of spending that day. It offers any.do because it encourages making such a ritual.<br><br>Hmm, interesting, maybe that's why I've always been attached to systems that copy DWM's dividing a task list into days, because you always either end or begin a day by closing the list.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting. Another angle is the "architecture of choice", Many choices are made by the "System One" of Daniel Kahneman:<br><br>"Feeling is a form of thinking. Both are ways we process information, but feeling is faster. "<br><br>- <a href="http://bigthink.com/errors-we-live-by/kahnemans-mind-clarifying-biases" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://bigthink.com/errors-we-live-by/kahnemans-mind-clarifying-biases</a><br><br>Would you prefer surgery with a 90% survival rate, or one with a 10% death rate? Personally I'd take the first option.<br><br>Choices always have a context, but was that context designed or by accident?  It means that if you change the context of choices, people make different choices. Mark's systems can be seen as varying the contexts (architectures) of choices.<br><br>The issues are:<br><br>how many options to present at a time<br>how the option space is scanned<br>how options are grouped<br>what is the default option<br>what is the most easily processed format of the options<br>what to feed back after a choice<br><br>See for example <a href="http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/suzanne.shu/ML%20choice%20architecture.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/suzanne.shu/ML%20choice%20architecture.pdf</a></div>
