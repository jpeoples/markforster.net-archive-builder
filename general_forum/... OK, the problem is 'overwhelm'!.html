<div class="content">Hi everyone, I seem to remember Simon H's thread about overcoming procrastination, and someone asked him what the cause was.<br><br>I can safely say that the cause for mine is sheer overwhelm... if you have a hundred projects (all important) on the go... where the heck do you start?!<br><br>I think that's my problem... maybe someone can offer some nuggets of advice...<br><br>Tim</div>

<div class="content">I do think overwhelm is the number one cause of procrastination.  The reality of life is there are only so many hours in the day and tasks take a certain amount of time to complete, so once you have learned how to work as efficiently as possible, you can only do one thing, which is eliminate projects.  I think Mark wrote about looking at your commitments in DIT and reducing them when you are falling behind.  <br><br>If you are in a work environment, you will have to raise your hand and seek help if everything is truly important to the business owners.  If this is a personal issue, you will have to realize you are not superman and reduce projects to the point where you can begin working again.<br><br>Various people disagree on the concept of prioritization, but I personally think people should attempt to prioritize and use a someday/maybe type list to track things they may like to do at somepoint. <br><br>I personally like the rule of three and use it for big goals.  I wrote that the way to get lots of things done is to have a short list and complete it and then move on to more things again on a short list as opposed to the long laundry list of ten plus projects/goals which causes overwhelm and nothing gets done.  the concept can even be used for task management which I also wrote about on my blog where I gave a method where the backlog can only shrink.<br><br>Good luck, let me know if I can help.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a><br><a href="http://www.desiredoutcomes.info" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.desiredoutcomes.info</a></div>

<div class="content">For me the thing that is most helpful when I'm feeling overwhelmed is momentum.  I will just pick something - whatever stands out - and do SOMETHING.  Doing that one thing usually snowballs into doing more and more things.</div>

<div class="content">To me it's essential to more or less have everything and then to reduce that everything to a small focus area.   <br><br>The autofocus answer is<br>1. Write it all down<br>2. Do a little of something<br>3. Find the next thing to do a little of. <br>This can get a lot of things started quickly and pull you out of your rut. Now you can just keep going and KNOW every important thing will eventually get done.<br><br>For me that's only the start. My next step is to study and understand what's on my list and work hard to reduce the list to essentials and then further identify the most important items to get extra attention.  Put these on a short list or just make sure to pause longer on the AF  loop.</div>
