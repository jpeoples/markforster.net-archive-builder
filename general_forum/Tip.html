<div class="content">I'm currently using my notebook again and found something very subtle that helps me with tasks to stand out.<br><br>Before I would cross out a task by drawing a single line through it. Habit still makes me do that.<br>But yesterday, I started scribbling over that line to completely block out the crossed out task. By not seeing any remnants of it, I find it easier to focus on active tasks on the page.<br><br>My pages now have their own little sections now and feel easier to manage and review.<br><br>Very subtle tip. Hope it helps.</div>
