<div class="content">Can I ask how you deal with tasks that are dated but not timed?  For example I have some people I have to phone Monday morning, and one or two other tasks that are date rather than time specific.<br><br>Do you put these in your calendar (untimed), and trasnfer to SF column 2 on the day? Or is there a better way?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alison,<br><br>I've been dealing with this by putting these reminders into my calendar, and then transferring them to my SF list at the start of the day. That process seems to work well: I've set up my calender to notify me at the start of the day when something is coming up.  But, unfortunately, yesterday this process broke down and I missed doing an important task...so obviously the process isn't quite as good as it should be.<br><br>Yesterday, I wanted to text someone who is making a shirt for me.  Because it was taking him a couple of weeks to do this, I had set the specific date at which I wanted to text him, adding that reminder to my calendar.  <br><br>Now, I tend to get up early, so at 4:00 AM I started working on the SF list.  I opened my iPhone and saw "Text Trevor" come up as a reminder.  So I added it to my list...<br><br>The thing is, I couldn't put it into column 2, because I didn't want to text him that early in the morning and if I put it into column 2 I would have had to do it right then.  So I put it into the last page of my list instead, into column 1.  Then I forgot about it, and set to work.  I happened to be on page 1 of my list, and while I worked all day I never got to the last page -- and so I completely missed doing this until late last night when I remembered it.<br><br>So...did I make a mistake to put it into column 1?  How should people deal with tasks, like the ones you mentioned, where something has to be done on a particular day, but can't be done right now?  I could have texted Trevor at 4:00 AM, but that would be rather obnoxious if the beeping of his phone woke him up!</div>

<div class="content">Kiwi Erik:<br><br>Don't your reminders have times on them? Why didn't you just time the reminder for 9am (or whatever time you are ready to text people)?</div>

<div class="content"><<Don't your reminders have times on them? Why didn't you just time the reminder for 9am (or whatever time you are ready to text people)?>><br><br>Hmmm...that would work, but I really dislike alarms that go off at a specific (arbitrary) times, because they interrupt whatever I'm working on at the time.  What's special about 9 AM? All that matters is that it has to be done *sometime* during the day, and not forgotten.<br><br>Now that I think of it, I could have written the reminder somewhere where I'll see it during the day.  I use a post-it note to mark the current page in my SF list, so I could just have written it on the post-it note.  That way, I could ignore it while I'm working on tasks on the list, but would see it every time I switched pages -- without being required to do it at a particular time or on a particular page.<br><br>Gee, I wish I'd thought of that yesterday!</div>

<div class="content">That's my scheme.  It's on the calendar for Monday Feb 28, and on Monday I'll put it where I see it during the day.  <br><br>But if it didn't need to be early Monday, I might just stick it in C1 with a big TODAY and get to it eventually.</div>

<div class="content">You could also have put it into Column 2, but then when you saw the task at 5 AM and couldn't physically do it because it's too early, you could have just copied it forward to Column 2 of the next page.</div>
