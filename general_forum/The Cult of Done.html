<div class="content">I stumbled across this while following links around from a discussion here, so it seems appropriate to post it back. I don't know whether the following has been posted here before, but I liked it.<br><br>THE CULT OF DONE MANIFESTO<br><br>The Cult of Done Manifesto<br><br>   1. There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.<br>   2. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.<br>   3. There is no editing stage.<br>   4. Pretending you know what you're doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you're doing even if you don't and do it.<br>   5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.<br>   6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.<br>   7. Once you're done you can throw it away.<br>   8. Laugh at perfection. It's boring and keeps you from being done.<br>   9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.<br>  10. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.<br>  11. Destruction is a variant of done.<br>  12. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.<br>  13. Done is the engine of more.<br><br>The original posting, with some nifty posters in the comments, can be found at <a href="http://www.brepettis.com/blog/2009/3/3/the-cult-of-done-manifesto.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.brepettis.com/blog/2009/3/3/the-cult-of-done-manifesto.html</a></div>

<div class="content">In my Franklin planner there was a similar sentiment expressed in the following quotation from Teddy Roosevelt:<br><br>In any moment of decision the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.</div>

<div class="content">Lefty,<br><br>You're joking, right?  That sounds like the kind of thinking that is causing havoc in society today.  Don't worry about perfection ... don't edit ... pretend you know when you don't ... if it takes more than a week it is not worth doing?  OMG, what kind of world results from that? That is the very state of mind I seek to FIX ... I see it as THE PROBLEM.  I sure am glad that Dr. Salk did not give up after not discovering the cure for polio in a week.  I'm sure glad Einstein worked on his theory of relativity after it was not done in a week.  I'm thankful that my doctor does not pretend to know when he does not ... and prescribes further tests.<br><br>I'm all for action, but action with no purpose other than action is ... well ... disaster.</div>

<div class="content">Ooh, how lovely: a cod manifesto!<br><br>Mike, you might prefer Nicholas Bate's seven levels of commitment:<br><br><a href="http://nicholasbate.typepad.com/nicholas_bate/2009/05/7-levels-of-committement.html" rel="nofollow">http://nicholasbate.typepad.com/nicholas_bate/2009/05/7-levels-of-committement.html</a><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">My doctoral research was on the stages of change which are similar to these levels of commitment. Stage predicted response to medication (even drug effectiveness is dependent on our commitment to change).<br><br>Mike, I agree with you. It would be nice if a short set of rules worked but we've discussed here many times the fact that sometimes obsession and overwork have produced greatness. We call those who make a difference exceptional for a reason.</div>

<div class="content">No, I'm not joking, particularly. I'm a big believer in George Patton's maxim that it's better to have a good plan today than a perfect plan tomorrow. Perfection is unachievable, it's silly to try: it only becomes a higher-order form of procrastination. Learn when "good enough" is good enough.<br><br>Similarly, "not knowing" can become a form of procrastination. You may not <I>know, </i>but you can guess, surmise and hypothesize, and then test those assumptions (which is to say, "pretend to know what you're doing") and see where you get. You might learn something.<br><br>Obsession and overwork may occasionally produce greatness (or more likely exist alongside it in some instances), but they more often produce anxiety, stress, hypertension, heart disease, ulcers, frustration, family problems and an early demise. I don't need to be that great.<br><br>I suspect folks need to think about what "done" means in a given context. Salk did not put an item on his "To Do" list which said "Invent polio vaccine", in order to be able to cross it off a dozen years later. This manifesto is tactical, not strategic.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lefty,<br><br>Sometimes it pays to identify where an overall world view will lead.  The items you listed might be defined in some way to make some sense ... but listed like that, taken together, it suggests to me a world view of sloppy, careless, half-assed, etc.  Just do something, anything, without thinking, and all will be well.<br><br>I'm quite sure that Salk did not have "invent polio cure" on his TO DO list.  He did have lots of other things on his list that led him there, most of them taking years of persistent work.  I'm quite sure he never said: "Oh, it's Friday.  I did not get it done but hell, it probably was not doable so I'll just bag it and go out for pizza and beer at the bowling alley and head off in a new direction on Monday."  I REALLY doubt that is how he saw the world.<br><br>As to Patton, he was indeed a man of action.  But he DID plan.  He planned battles for YEARS.  He was a military historian and knew every battle ever fought in every previous war.  He learned by the successes and failures of others.  His "not perfect" plans were very well planned and took into account everything he knew.  And he was not the kind of person to give up ... he pushed on and on and on.  He pushed so hard he outran his fuel supply and had to improvise to move on further.</div>

<div class="content">Someone's created a great poster image of the Cult of Done: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lizhenry/3489717185/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/lizhenry/3489717185/</a><br><br>I downloaded the image a while ago, tweaked the contrast, and printed it out at the right size to paste onto the front of my Autofocus notebook. Makes a nice reminder whenever I pick it up :)</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>I fear you may be American, so you probably haven't been brought up in a society crippled by the cult of effortless superiority. This says:<br><br>- the truly admirable people are effortlessly superior<br>- working at it is cheating: attempting to pass yourself as something you aren't<br>- it's better to be effortlessly inferior than effortfully superior (if the latter is even possible)<br>- failure is not an option<br><br>If you are not effortlessly superior, you can't strive and you can't risk failure, you don't tend to get a lot done.<br><br>I think we're getting better now, but a call to ACTION is probably still in order. For us.<br><br>The thing is to look hard at the choice you're trying to make.<br><br>I am going to do something: should I plan it?<br><br>I am going to do something: should I check the plan again?<br><br>I am going tp do something. I don't fel quite ready and I'm not sure what will make me feel ready: should I just start and take the risk of heading off in the wrong direction.<br><br>I don't know what to work on next: does this matter?<br><br>I'm holding people up while I finish off. What I have done is fit for purpose. Should I take my work a few steps closer to perfection before I let people move on? (This is the tricky one!)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Will,<br><br>I found it kind of hard to figure out what  you are saying here.  But working from the bit I did understand ...<br><br>You said: "I fear you may be American,"<br><br>ROTF ;-)  Is it the salvation of my soul you fear?  Well, fear not, I assure you that I've already been saved. ;-)  I'm actually quite aware of the problems inherent in my choice of birthplace and I pray daily for the salvation of my soul.  ;-)<br><br>You said: "so you probably haven't been brought up in a society crippled by the cult of effortless superiority."<br><br>Well, I've been brought up in the society I've been brought up in, but I don't share a whole lot of its values.  Your point if view does strike me as a bit odd.  I'd fear for my life if I wandered into some venues and said something like: "Oh, I'm so sorry you are black.  That is obviously a crippling disability what with having to speak in rap and all."  LOL ;-)  A very odd viewpoint indeed.  To say nothing of being outrageously politically incorrect!  (Of course, that political incorrectness earns you nothing but my deepest admiration ;-)<br><br>As to the "cult of effortless superiority", I have no idea at all what you mean by that ... but I'm sure you'll now tell me.<br><br>You go on to illuminate my woeful ignorance as follows: "This says:<br><br>- the truly admirable people are effortlessly superior"<br><br>Well, it is at least something to be in awe of, no?  I mean, if I struggle to add a column of numbers and get different results each time I do it ... even WITH a calculator ... I'd have to think it at least noteworthy if someone glances at a polynomial and can rattle off it's second derivative!  I suppose I could think he was a freak of nature.  And, not to put too fine a point on it, your understanding of the American predicament falters here because it is that last attitude that is actually most prevalent.  It is precisely those who are talented, thoughtful and serious about life who are held up to ridicule.  The only ones really worshiped for superiority in the American culture are athletes ... we pay them megabucks for the privilege of watching them spit on the ground and grab their crotches.<br><br>Continuing: "- working at it is cheating: attempting to pass yourself as something you aren't<br>- it's better to be effortlessly inferior than effortfully superior (if the latter is even possible)<br>- failure is not an option"<br><br>I have no idea what comic book you got that from but those ideas are foreign to me (pun intended ;-)  We have a popular show here on TV (well, popular in a cult kind of way ;-) called "Mythbusters".  It kind of defies description and I don't even know if the hosts are American ... they might be pseudo American (i.e. Canadian ;-)  Anyhow, Adam Savage (one of the hosts) often wears a T-Shirt emblazoned "Failure is always an option."  If anything, hard work is kind of the ethos of the culture.  At least it is up to my generation.  It probably has been changing somewhat, but I'm sure not too much.<br><br>Following this you kind of lost me.  I don't know what point of view you are writing from.  Is this what I am supposed to believe because I am inflicted by my selection of birthplace?  Is this what I am supposed to believe because it is "right thinking"?  I'm not sure of your intent, so I can't comment further.<br><br>Well I'm off now to see if some other country will take me.  Perhaps then I can start thinking correctly ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Okay, I have to admit that I am somewhat at a loss with this thread. The thing called "The Cult of Done Manifesto", what is it? Because it wasn't meant to be a joke, I presume it is some sort of poetry that I don't understand. <br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Oops.<br><br>Mike,<br><br>What I was trying to say was that we English had a cultural bias which often led us to stand around whining rather than taking action. This really goes back to my formative years in the 70s and is a bit better now, but some of us still find a call to urgent action refreshing.<br><br>I suspect that you have been brought up doing battle with the opposite problem in America, so you naturally see this as dangerous and inappropriate.<br><br>Rainer,<br><br>This thread is about an inspiring call to action. Mike sees too much action already and not enough care and direction. I see too little. This is at least in part because we come from different cultures with different values and problems.<br><br>So I don't have a problem with Mike seeing this manifesto as dangerous and inappropriate while I see it as helpful and inspiring. That does not mean that I will use it as an excuse for the sort of stupidity that Mike points out.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Will,<br><br>You said: "What I was trying to say was that we English had a cultural bias which often led us to stand around whining rather than taking action. This really goes back to my formative years in the 70s and is a bit better now, but some of us still find a call to urgent action refreshing."<br><br>Well, I can't find fault with that.  Americans also whine a lot.  There is a strong sense of entitlement that has been growing over the last few decades.  "The world owes me a living." as my father used to put it.  Lately I've been seeing people walk into traffic and even slow down when they see an oncoming car as if to dare the driver to hit them so they can sue.  Nuts.<br><br>You said: "I suspect that you have been brought up doing battle with the opposite problem in America, so you naturally see this as dangerous and inappropriate."<br><br>In a way, yes.  I've had lots of problems (in business) with people running off "half-cocked" to start projects.  My career was in software and system development.  I can't tell you how costly it is when people start coding before they start thinking.  The problem is all to prevalent and very costly.  Just think about how much Windows drives you crazy.  It is basically because they did not think through the implications of what they had in mind before they went ahead with it.<br><br>That said, it IS possible to over think.  It is possible to strive for unachievable perfection and lose the advantage of agility and speed.  But I don't think that the answer is to make a "cult" of "good enough is good enough".  There was a business philosophy some years ago (in the early '70's if memory serves) called "Zero Defects".  It has fallen by the wayside for some reason ... probably because it was just a buzz word in the first place.  But the example given to justify it was:<br><br>"So you think 99.6% is good enough?  What if your plane had a 99.6% chance of landing safely?  Would you think that was good enough?" <br><br>The point is that for some things, perfection must be the standard ... nothing else is acceptable.<br><br>Last point ... as with so many other things (ZD, 6-Sigma, Vision and Mission Statements, MBO, etc.) this is often about buzz words to keep investors thinking that business has discovered some wonderful new philosophy which will give them an edge and so earn the investors more money.  As P.T. Barnum pointed out: "There's a sucker born every minute ... and two to take him."  So long as we don't see through the hype and buzz words and note that none of this is anything new and most of it is meaningless drivel ... that is how long we will be suckers.  ;-)  Yes, "Strike while the iron is hot."  but also remember that "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."  For every platitude there is an opposite, and just as wise sounding, one.  (I wonder if anyone has cataloged them all and arranged them in contradictory pairs?  LOL ;-)</div>
