<div class="content">I'm sure I'm not the only one who's missing Christine B's contributions to this forum; it's quite a while since she posted.  If you're out there, Christine, best wishes.</div>

<div class="content">Christine, I've been missing you too! (did I miss that you were on holidays or something?)</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I've been wondering what's happened to her as well. Her last posts on this forum were on June 1st. So I guess she must just be on holiday. <br><br>If she doesn't reappear in the next few days I might give her a call to check that she's all right.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, the last time we were talking about the benefits of breaks, she had said that she wouldn't be able to take one for quite some time.  I do hope everything is ok.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>I've emailed her, texted her, and put a message on Facebook. So hopefully we will hear from her soon. Her voicemail doesn't appear to be switched on. <br><br>At least she will know she is being missed!</div>

<div class="content">I do hope she is well.  I am home with a flu virus.  Yesterday, my doctor diagnosed me with bacterial pneumonia.  I am on a potent antibiotic and hope to be better soon.  Let me tell you....pneumonia is NOT fun.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">And I'm just coming back to life after struggling with the dreaded Swine Flu. Haven't looked at my AF list once, though I have perused this board daily. Now what does that mean?</div>

<div class="content">David,<br>I was worried about you, too. Not a single post of yours asking when AF2 would be delivered since it was announced!!!<br><br>Avrum,<br>I like so much your comments, and the best one is AF6. <br><br> ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi All<br><br>Thank you all SO much for your concern - it is really, really appreciated.  I have been unwell for the past couple of weeks and wasn't accessing my email, Facebook, or even the forum.  I literally cannot remember when I have been away from my PC for so long - even on holiday!!  I'm just about getting back to normal - well normal for me anyway :-) so will hopefully start posting again soon - I can see I have a lot to catch up on!!<br><br>Thanks again to everyone and I'm sorry to have worried you - I'm so touched that you all cared so much - it REALLY is appreciated.<br><br>David & Avrum - I'm sorry to hear you have both been unwell and hope you are also well on the way to recovery.<br><br>Very best wishes to all</div>

<div class="content">Whew! Glad to hear that you are on the mend, Christine! We MISSED you! (Although I have had your "Sisyphus" quote printed out and posted on my computer, so you were "nearby"!) <br><br>Hope David and Avrum that you are also both feeling better soon ... and anyone else on the "sick list" ... (I do hope it's a coincidence of timing for those who have been unwell!)</div>

<div class="content">Just spent my first full day back with AF and finally feel I am getting back in the swing of things.  And a big thank you again to all who have been so kind with their comments - I've been really moved by you all.<br><br>I'm also really excited to see how AF2 works out - a bit scared about how my 50+ active pages will respond though (don't have the courage to start from scratch .........) !!!</div>

<div class="content">Welcome back, Christine!  Don't be afraid to start from scratch with AF2, as Mark recommends - he's given us a cracker of a system (thanks, Mark).  I have a task to "cherry-pick tasks from AF1 and add to AF2", which I will keep re-entering until I'm happy I've transferred everything I want to.  It gives me the chance to add to my AF2 list anything that's urgent and/or important (or just that I fancy doing soon) at a rate that I choose.  I think it would have been much more daunting to start AF2 using the current AF1 list, especially with as many active pages as you have.  I'm still using the same notebook, but started on a new page for AF2; so it's easy to access the AF1 list.<br><br> So far, I've found that I'm working on AF2 for much more of the day than with AF1.  For example, I have some tasks that I like to do first thing in the morning, every day, and under AF1 I found it easier to do those tasks "off-list" and get them out of the way before working my AF1 list.  However, I often had some resistance to doing them, and grudged the time they took before I could get started on AF1.  Under the new system, I add those tasks every day to the end of the list, and they are therefore all instantly available, which wasn't necessarily the case in AF1, where they maybe appeared several pages on from my AF1 starting page, and I'd have to do at least one task on the intervening pages.   Under AF2, these every-day tasks  usually 'stand out' and get done before I go on to other tasks.   <br><br>Best of luck, and I'm looking forward to hearing how you get on.</div>
