<div class="content">OK guys, this demo has been a major pain in my rear...<br><br>The video linked below includes a screencast of my SFv3 setup in Toodledo. It's about six minutes long but the videos get a little wonky at the end (apparently six minutes of video data is too much for Keynote to export smoothly - who knew?).<br><br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/SFv3Video.mov" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/SFv3Video.mov</a><br><br>I think it's pretty self-explanatory but let me know if you have any questions!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sarah very interesting how you do it. I also liked the use of context. <br><br>For me SF has a problem about the link to relatives projects. <br><br>Thanks you for sharing this with is and the time you took to do it.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah, thanks for the demo. It really helped to understand the workflow using the tool better. If you need to step out, how do you mark the task that is "current'? Also, I assume you just move all the "active" tasks that are dismissed to the Dismissed folder.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah you gave me a fantastic idea about contexts. With Gtd I alway had some problem with this because i used the wrong contexts. Ie @Call (I have a phone every where) @Mail I have a mail everywhere. Seeing your demo on toodledo let me realized suddenly at a glance that i could organize it differently. Instead I could do it about what i really do then they became <br>@Strategy (when I work about the strategy of my company), @Négociate (when I focus on my negociation, @Backing (when I consolidate my negociation ex making a contract), @prospect (when I try to find new clients or new buidings) @Organize (When I organize my stuff) @Leaning (when I take time to learn things) @Playing (When I take time to play) @Family (when I do something about my family) @Errands (when I buy things)<br><br>I know it's just GTD but since then I never did it like this and I admit it's incredible efficient because it's the way I work. And it's perfect with Omnifocus. <br><br>So thank you so much ! <br>You indeed, helped me a lot. <br><br>Jupiter.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, I'm glad it helped you!<br>Greenchutney, the marking of what you're doing is one not-easy thing.  One thing you *could* do is expand the view of the current task as you start it.  The system does remember which page you were last on so you don't lose your place COMPLETELY.</div>

<div class="content">Wow, it looks like you have a lot on your list--thanks so much for squeezing in doing this tutorial!<br><br>I am going to give your method a try. One question: how do you define a "page"? In other words, how do you restrict the number of entries, as you would on a sheet of paper?</div>
<h2>Reply by Greenchutney</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-26 3:09</div>
<div class="content">Thanks Sarah. I decided to give this method a try. I have pretty much kept your setup intact. I am thinking of using the Star to mark the task that's in progress if I decide to step out. The one thing that I am a bit confused is that when I refresh the page after any changes (task completed etc.), the sort seems to change the order of some of the tasks (btw, tasks sorted by priority within a page). I didn't notice that in your demo. But, have you seen this issue? Or is there another setup that I am missing? Thanks again for your help.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-26 3:32</div>
<div class="content">DS- pages are 25 items long. Unfortunately I haven't found a good way to keep track of this other than just counting. I can usually tell when it's getting close, though.<br><br>GC- I don't know why it would be changing your sort order... I've never noticed it changing mine.  My sorts are (I believe) priority and then date added.  The star to indicate what you're working on is a good idea.</div>
<h2>Reply by Greenchutney</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-26 4:16</div>
<div class="content">Perfect! I missed the date added criteria. Now it is not changing. I just wish I could sort by one more criteria -> by context - to separate out home/work items. For that it appears that you need to upgrade to Pro.<br><br>GC</div>
<h2>Reply by Greenchutney</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-26 4:45</div>
<div class="content">Okay, I think I have figured it out. I am now using Priority=0 for C1-Home, P=1 for C1-Work and P=2 for all C2 tasks. I don't see any reason now to differentiate Home/Work for C2 items. Let me try this for a bit more and see how it goes.</div>

If you don't retain checked items, the total number of tasks (20 for me) per page is hard to ascertain. By retaining the done items, you don't inadvertently add more items than the max number in a page.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">@GC: thanks for that, a 'doh' or senior moment for me!<br><br>Further to me previous post today, I went onto the Toodledo site.  My concerns are:<br><br>(1) The only current offline method is the printable booklet, not so?  It's useful, but I was hoping it would be a bit like Evernote in allowing offline processing and then synchronising via the cloud, or whatever.<br><br>(2) Looking at the Toodledo Forums (Fori?  Forumae?), I see users and others have been requesting an Android version for several months, but the developer seems entirely focused on iOS, pleading lack of resources.<br><br>I don't mind the 'slim' browser view, will try that out on Gill's Galaxy tablet, but I think the developer should also produce an Android version which is growing faster than others.<br><br>iPhone users: can you use Toodledo in offline mode ie unconnected to the Internet?  I don;t know why I'm asking this, I decided a long time agao not to get an iPhone, tempting though it is (my younger son is enamoured with his, has been the catalyst for making him more IT/connectivity-savvy, whatever.</div>

<div class="content">Roger,<br>The iPhone app provides the offline access with a sync to the web. Also, if you use Outlook, you may be able to use that as a staging area for offline access. There is a sync capability between Outlook and Toodledo.<br><br>GC</div>

I've modified my TDD/SF setup to follow more closely your setup with sorting by Priority + DateAdded. I abbreviated page(folder) names to ".01", ".02" etc; so I can see more pages in the tabs. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Currently I'm usually working with two views, that I pin as two tabs in Chrome ...<br><br>(1) Primary view is the "folder" view, with all pages, sorted by "Priority : Forwards" and "Date Modified : Reverse" (instead of Date Added).<br><br>(2) Secondary view is the "main" view, where I usually use the "All Tasks" subtab, sorted by "Date Modified : Forwards" only, so I can use it to easily recap what I've just done. I also use the "Starred" subtab, to see my current task (that I star), and two special starred tasks "**Start**" and "**Top**" that I use to record what page I started on for the day, and what page is the top and when I get to it (still only getting about 1 cycle per day).<br><br>I do have "tags" field active that I may use for projects, but haven't done so. I use searching on the "main" view "All Tasks" subtab to find tasks for same projects.<br><br>For contexts, I've used two of the four priority levels to indicate "home" and "errands" tasks ...<br>"3 Top" is C2<br>"2 High" is C1, Errands<br>"1 Medium" is C1, Office (default)<br>"0 Low" is C1, Home</div>

<div class="content">I started with a notebook for SF and it worked well - when I had the notebook with me! I was looking at a low overhead electronic implementation and thanks to Sarah's Toodledo demo, I think I have it. I have used this for 3 weeks and I think I finally have something that's working for me very well. So for those who might be interested --<br><br>My setup:<br><br>As with sabre23t, I use the priority levels to distinguish contexts and Columns:<br>3 Top -- C2<br>2 High -- C1, Errands<br>1 Medium -- C1, Work<br>0 Low -- C1, Home<br><br>Pages in Folders -- Sorted by "Priority : Forwards" and "Date Added : Reverse". This setting keeps the C2 items on the top and C1 items below. So, I always look at C2 items before I move on to C1 items. <br><br>I tried a few other settings but discarded them as the overhead became too high.<br><br>When the total number of tasks in Priority 0, 1 and 2 (basically C1 tasks) reaches 20, I rename the folder to show that it is closed and no C1 tasks can be added to the page -- Example: Page1 becomes Page1C. My C2 count is pretty small and I keep this to a minimum. C2 creates a ton of resistance for me unless they are really urgent. But, I do like the flexibility of having urgent tasks in C2 as part of the workflow. I try to breakdown the tasks to bite sized chunks so that it can be completed in one sitting and the next task in a project goes to C1. This has kept the C2 to very small in number (at the most 5). As ubi mentions in a separate thread, this has been working for me well. <br><br>The workflow is very similar to what you see in Sarah's demo. The one addition is that I mark a task with star to show that the task is being worked on.<br><br>I have a "Dismissed" Folder. When a page gets dismissed, all the tasks from the page is moved to this folder. I do have a recurring task "Review Dismissed Items" so I can check on them regularly. If I feel any of them is ready to be done, I move it back to C1 of the last page.<br><br>Once a page is dismissed or fully completed, it is archived to keep away the clutter.<br><br>I also keep tickler in Toodledo. I have a folder called Tickler and have created a saved search: Recent7d - Tasks overdue last 7 days and due in the next 7 days. I check this everyday to see if any of them needs to be moved SF list. I prefer this because the Outlook I use is work based and I didn't want personal items in there. Any tasks that have a due date goes in here. <br><br>I keep all my projects in Evernote. The next step is always available in Evernote and it gets moved to SF when the previous task is complete. <br><br>I keep my Toodledo and Evernote pinned in my browser. I also have iPhone apps for both Toodledo and Evernote for mobility.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content"><< "Date Added : Reverse" ... I tried a few other settings but discarded them as the overhead became too high. >><br><br>Are you cloning all your partially completed tasks? I did that initially but find it a bit too much overhead. I change to sorting by "Date Modified : Forwards", so I don't need to clone partially completed tasks. Just starring it would "modify" it, or just updating its notes will do the same.  No need to clone.</div>

<div class="content">Like I mentioned, I keep the idea of "unfinished" tasks to the bare minimum. I break down the tasks to bite sized chunks that can be done in one sitting - more like the next action from GTD. This keeps the cloning to the minimum. Also, even if the task is modified it will move to the end of the page. But, it needs to move to the "next" page according to the rules. So you need to touch it anyway, right? <br><br>BTW, I am experimenting with the addition of 1 task - "Current page - First C1 task done?". When I come to the page for the first time, I star this task to show that this is the Current page. Then when I finish the first C1 task, I check this task off. When I move off the page, I uncheck the task and un-Star the task. Every page has this task. This is working for now but it hasn't been long enough to hit any corner cases. I got this idea from Mark, to mimic his circle method in toodledo workflow! This seems to be foolproof so far - as long as I get into the habit of checking/unchecking the task properly. <br><br>I have one nit with Toodledo. When I check the task as completed, the task text becomes grey. However, when I refresh the page, the text becomes regular font color again. I am not sure why that happens. Anyone using Toodledo see that?<br><br>GC</div>

So these tasks such as "Read Gmail", just gets its page no updated to last page each time it stands out and I read a few mail. Just one step.

I was doing similar earlier on, with C2 pages named with additional "a", so typically the sorted folders tab looks like ".01", ".01a", ".02", ".02a" etc. However, I found managing the C2 tasks as separate folders page to have significant overhead. Hence, I've added "priority" field to differentiate C2 and C1 tasks (mentioned earlier).

<div class="content">I realized I am not using the context field at all. So, I have moved to sorting by Context field instead of priority.
