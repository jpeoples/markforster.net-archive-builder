<div class="content">Working with Autofocus 1 at the moment, I found tasks that I would just cross off as not relevant anymore, if I would use FVP or Simple Scanning. <br><br>But in Autofocus 1 this is not part of the rules. I should just wait until the whole page gets dismissed. <br><br>I like that, because it's faster for now, I just proceed scanning without even having to do the crossing out and any mental activity that comes with that.<br><br>But, when I dismiss the page, then I would highlight these tasks for further consideration. These seems wrong, there should be the option in the rules to cross out any task I don't want to highlight when dismissing a page.<br><br>What should I do? My aim is to be as true to the spirit of the rules as possible.</div>

<div class="content">I advise, that "tasks that I would just cross off as not relevant anymore, if I would use FVP or Simple Scanning" you still cross off.  Every moment you leave it uncrossed is another moment it needlessly gets read again on your next pass.<br><br>Yet I do not see how this bears on your title, as crossing or not crossing should not affect when the page is dismissed, nor if it feels premature.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>Alan is right. You can remove a task at any time which you have decided you don't want to do at all.</div>

<div class="content">I think there's an interesting effect if one resists the temptation to manually delete tasks in AF1. The idea being to let the system do all the work for you. I suppose if a task is clearly irrelevant (e.g. deadline passed) or you're 100% sure you're not going to do it, it probably should be crossed out (as Mark says here). But otherwise it seems to be me a valid option to adhere to the original instructions literally and to leave (almost) everything to the automatic dismissal.<br><br>For me, this is a big difference between AF1 and Simple Scanning. In Simple Scanning, I frequently (too frequently?) prune tasks as I go around the list. Whereas in AF1, I calmly leave tasks alone even if I probably won't do them, allowing the system to catch the tasks which are found wanting. Likely, there are pros and cons to both approaches.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone! Belacqua, I do share your sense for purity, but for now I've decided to go with Alan's common sense.</div>
