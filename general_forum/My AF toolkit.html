<div class="content">I just thought I'd share with everyone what I use for my AF system, maybe others could comment on whether it sounds right or not...?<br><br>I have an A4 spiral-bound notebook for my master AF list, a pen, a ruler (for crossing off!) and my diary - this is used for appointments which I don't put onto my AF list.  These items are all put into an A4 "button folder" which is carried around with me!<br><br>I also have an A5 notebook plus pen in my car, in an A5 "button folder" for any ideas whilst I'm on the move.<br><br>Does that sound like I'm carrying the right tools with me...?<br><br>I would be interested to hear any feedback on this, whether I'm doing it right by entering appointments in my diary rather than my AF list.<br><br>Jason</div>

<div class="content">Sounds fine Jason, Mark advocates the use of a separate schedule or diary - I have a task to "check schedule" so I don't forget but that is because I am likely to otherwise!  I think the various posts show how we all work in different ways and will no doubt adapt the actual mechanics, i.e. type of notebook etc, to what is comfortable for us.  Mark says he is using an A4 34 lined notepad and I personally find that to suit the system very well, and I too have a separate book to catch tasks in when on the move.  Although I quite happily convert that to an electronic system which is working well for me I see that as an "add-on" and like the paper based approach (although I definitely need to look at the ideas from the posts regarding messy handwriting!)<br><br>Hope that helps ......</div>

<div class="content">I use the following notebook:<a href="http://www.officeworld.com/Worlds-Biggest-Selection/24050/09Q1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.officeworld.com/Worlds-Biggest-Selection/24050/09Q1/</a><br><br>It's got the following things:<br>Numbers for the lines!!!  1-28 on the first page and 29-56 on the back!<br>Top headers with place for "Page no.", subject line, and prepared by and date<br>Left column "Project Action Notes" where i use it to write "11" for date done, and have been experimenting with writing start and end times for the step I was working on--REALLY am liking that!<br><br>Bob</div>

<div class="content">Bob,<br><br>What a coincidence. I'm currently using the exact Gold Fibre notebook for my "Home" list. I also had laying around a similyar larger version (8 1/2 x 11) one by Cambridge for my "Work list" that is bound at the top of the page with 29 lines per page. The "Project action notes" column left of the numbered lines is handy.</div>

<div class="content">Why is it that there is so much great stationery that side of the pond?  :-(<br><br>Totally unrelated question John, Is Marshall Fields still called Marshall Fields or did they finally change the name?</div>
