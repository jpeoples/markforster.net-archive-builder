<div class="content">For the past few weeks, I've had a solid go at GTD combined with the DWM dating scheme. Tonight - at a GTD Meetup in Toronto - I spoke to the group (none of whom heard of Mark's work) and mentioned how I'm using DWM to keep Next Actions & Projects from going stale. The general consensus seemed to be: "Brilliant! I'm implementing this tonight".</div>

<div class="content">I have no idea of how your system is set up Avrum, but the DWM dating scheme you refer to, I assume means the Calendar? GTD to do lists refer of course to non-calendar items. <br><br>I like Wunderlist as a to do list manager but I find I don't have time or attention to keep track of different lists in different programmes, and as I am going to have to view my Calendar every day I want tasks to appear there. Since I am pretty much tied into the Google ecosystem that means either Google tasks or Gqueues out of the current options alongside Google Calendar <br><br>If I was at home all day I'd use paper, but as I'm often travelling I find I end up scribbling important stuff on bits of paper which I invariably lose.</div>

<div class="content"><< but the DWM dating scheme you refer to, I assume means the Calendar? >><br><br>I would say Avrum didn't mean calendar, Shak. But he would be referring to DWM sorting of tasks by "expiry/dismissal" date. New tasks expire in one month. Reentered tasks expire in one week.<br><br>Ref <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/26/review-of-the-systems-dwm-day-week-month.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/26/review-of-the-systems-dwm-day-week-month.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Yes. This could be a way to easily make review. I guess.</div>
