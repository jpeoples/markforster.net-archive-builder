<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I do not try to tweak AF system but just make it work smoothly <br><br>I have some tasks that are weekly or twice a month tasks. I have 3 options:<br>1- put them at the end of the open list<br>2- put them in some reminder system with alarm that will tell me to put it back to AF list<br>3- ( Bad or good idea). Put the task on next empty page.<br><br>Explanation of option 3:<br>We all know how many pages we do / day or week ( Lets say I do 4 pages / week)  so if I want get some task be done in 1 week I can put it 2 pages away so I get it in the list half a week away. I hope you follow my idea.<br><br>So the question is : Option 3 is good or bad ?<br><br><br>Do I have more options :D</div>

<div class="content">For that kind of items, I like better the reminder system. I use outlook , but I have experienced a trick that also works : write the reminder with action and due date on a post-it note, a few pages away from the end of open list. <br>When you reach the post-it, it's easy to copy the action at the appropriate place if the time has come. If it's not time yet (let's say your did 8 pages this week instead of 4 usually), you just move the post-it note a few pages away.</div>

<div class="content">Remark : the post-it trick will work for a few tasks only, and for rather close due date. It will be too much overhead otherwise.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>This option is only for task 1-2 weeks away (ex: buy bread).<br>For task month away is google calendar or outlook a good solution.</div>

<div class="content">I use a tickler file (43 folders style) for anything which is in the future, which I define as over 1 week forward. I put a note or copy of a letter, birthday list - whatever- in the relevant date or a week before if e.g. I need to send a birthday card or a cheque to make a payment. I check the appropriate day file every morning first thing or the night before if I am feeling particularly efficient, and then if I do not action it that day it either goes onto my AF list or is refiled for another date.<br><br>I have a recurring entry for "check tickler file" on my AF list.<br><br>Works a treat and requires no technology, and it has the advantage of keeping my AF list clear of longer term things.</div>

<div class="content">I personally keep a tickler page at the back of my notebook for anything I'm going to clearly not do until next month or beyond.  I'm perfectly comfortable with items being on my list that won't get actioned until next week.  I regularly include items like this that get done weekly. <br><br>I don't have anything that is twice a month specifically.  If I did I think I might push that into a tickler page that I keep at the back of my notebook and just put in a weekly action to pull items in from it.</div>
