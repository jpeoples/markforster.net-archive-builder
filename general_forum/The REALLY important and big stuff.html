<div class="content">What I have NOT achieved in AF is this: Focusing on big, longterm projects. AF is great for getting things off my list. But I found it is mostly the small, easy and pleasant stuff. <br><br>I keep catching myself rewriting tasks over and over gain referring to longer term projects.  But they never get done or at least acted upon partially. It is easier to postpone them (psychologically) then to actually tackle them. <br><br>An example to make this more vivid:<br><br>I've been wanting to move away from the neighbourhood I am living now and look at another house. I am not happy here but still comfortable where I am but know, that this is a dead end and eventually I have to move because my lease is running out. But I keep postponing any action. I keep saying to myself: "I still have time to do it next week". I look at my AF list and do the quick, the pleasant and the easy stuff.<br><br>In a year or so I have to do everything in a frenzy (and I will) but I never seem to be able to focus on such important, longterm and important goals / projects in a timely manner. Especially when I am still in the comfort zone right now. <br><br>In the past I had picked a "Big Rock of the week" and tried to focus on it. That was useful. I may go back to that approach. <br><br>I'd be interested on how others can manage their really IMPORTANT, DIFFICULT, or UNPLEASANT projects which have a high propensity of getting procrastinated on. <br><br>Renrew<br></div>

<div class="content">Renrew:<br><br>If you are "re-writing tasks over and over again referring to longer term projects" then you are not carrying out the instructions properly. They should not be re-written unless you have taken some action on them. If you have re-written them many times, then you should by now have taken quite a bit of action on them.<br><br>In the case of your house move, you will eventually get to the stage where you either have to take action or dismiss the task altogether. The system won't let you go on postponing action indefinitely.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Renrew<br><br>When I started AF I had a number of backlog issues I needed to address and some projects that were of varying degrees of completion and varying degrees of importance.  As I got into AF those projects and tasks settled down into a pattern and started progressing (or were put aside).  However my "big" problem area that I "needed" to address continued to sneer at me day by day.  I was addressing bits of it but that was more on a necessity basis than anything.  After a couple of weeks of AF I began to realise where the blockages were - and like most "problems" the issues were less do do with the physical actions required for completion, but were primarily due to less tangible issues, fear of conflict, emotional attachments etc etc.  At that point I had a choice.  I either dealt with those factors or I lived with the fact that those associated tasks were unlikely to stand out, and therefore I may get to the stage of "last minute frenzy".  It took a couple of months but eventually there came a day that I was ready to deal with the non-tangible issues and get on with the project.  The project itself, with its' accompanying problems and workload, is not yet fully cleared - but it will be!  However the resistance has all but disappeared.   <br><br>At this point in time you say you "are comfortable".   For whatever reason that level of comfort is currently more important to you than the move and that is why you are not actioning it.  Take some time to look at your feelings surrounding that move and that may in itself be sufficient to unblock whatever is holding you back.....<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">I would take a number of steps in the positive direction and let those which are negative go for a while.  For example: start looking for a new apartment/house now.  No, it will not be available when you are finally ready to move, but the act of looking for a NEW place will get your mind working along positive directions and generate some excitement.  Take a camera with you and snap pictures of interesting neighborhoods and even the inside of some places.  Put pictures up on your computer desktop, maybe a revolving desktop photo show to keep you interested.<br><br>Make a list of all of the new and interesting things you will do once you have moved.  Will your new place be near a park?  Near fun places to eat?  Whatever.  In short, build positive motivation and once you get your excitement going start to tackle the small things.  Downsize.  Get rid of old junk you won't take with you.  Start talking up your move with friends.  Have them go with you to visit places.  Have them help you take stuff to the charity.  Get your life moving around the idea of moving and soon, you'll have some hard things to do but they will be the LAST things and you'll have a lot of investment and excitement in the move to propel you forward.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for your comments. It gives me food for thought. I also think that my current "procrastination mode" has nothing to do with any system that I am currently using. It is more an issue of avoidance of unpleasanteries and "getting out of the comfort zone". Those issues have do be dealt with first. And AF is showing me that I have to do this FIRST before the system can become meaningful. <br><br>Again, maybe others can comment on how they are dealing with their important / bigger / more adverserial projects in their life and how to move them forward and not fall into the trap of doing the fun, the easy and fast things first. <br><br>Renrew<br></div>

<div class="content">Renrew<br><br>Don't panic and feel that you HAVE to deal with the issues that AF shows you immediately.  With the way that AF works, it is it's very ability to identify reasons for procrastination that is it's amazing strength.  The initial impression we have is that procrastination equals laziness.  In fact procrastination is rarely caused by laziness, rather is an avoidance technique to tasks we do not want to do.  If we take the time to look at those tasks (which we rarely do) we will see that in the majority of cases it is not that the task is particularly difficult, or genuinely unpleasant.<br><br>AF provides a safe environment to identify reasons for resistance to tasks.  It is a safe environment for the very reason that you do not have to act on that new knowledge immediately (you still have the option to "just do" the task or to dismiss it).  However you are absolutely right in that, until those things are dealt with, there will always be times when the system appears hard.  It took me about two months from "point of revelation" to dealing with the underlying fear of conflict which enabled me to really do more than chip away at my backlog.  Nevertheless I have still benefitted immensely from AF in that period whilst still struggling with those related tasks, but know that when I finally clear that issue that will enable AF to flow even better.<br><br>Other issues I was able to identify and action immediately - I posted the following about my "dishwasher revelation"  in an earlier post ....<br><br>This is exactly what I have found. Ironically it was the act of putting "unstack dishwasher" on my task on Day 1 of Beta Testing that highlighted for me the fact that I don't like being told "when" to do something. I had decided at some point that stacking/unstacking the dishwasher would be a good task to do whilst making coffee - but always resented doing it. Then I realised that the resistance was actually to being told "when" to do it - even though it was me doing the telling!! Now I do it quite happily, and when? .... usually when making a cup of coffee :-) <br><br>Now I know how I think, I know why a structured approach has always been a problem for me.  I couldn't quite believe that my not liking being told when to do something extended to telling myself! :-) Knowing that makes life so much easier - all I need to do is find a way to allow myself to use AF for such tasks instead of scheduling!!!</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Funny how after telling me that bottom-up methodology is no plan at all you then propose exactly that to Renfrew. What you've suggested to him is exactly what I mean by letting things arise naturally from what you're doing.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-04-10 2:31</div>
<div class="content">Mark, wasn't Mike's recommendation to plan that way because Renfrew's issue is more about battling resistance than it is about developing a "plan"?  JMHO.  <br><br>It's been my impression from his posts that Mike is flexible and creative enough to use either method according to the situation at hand.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-04-10 10:05</div>
<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>But that's exactly what the problem is with planning. One writes a wonderful plan and then finds that one can't carry it through because of resistance to it. That was exactly the point I was making in the other thread which Mike was objecting to.<br><br>If one starts in the way Mike outlines above, then the plan will emerge naturally out of what one is doing and there will be much less resistance to it. This is exactly what I have been saying.<br><br>Again I stress that I am talking here about planning one's own individual projects. I am not talking about "project planning" in the sense of co-ordinating the activities of a number of people.</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Mark,<br><br>No, I was not suggesting a "plan" in that case.  I was suggesting some "tasks" which could serve as motivation to overcome resistance.  While it is true that those tasks might ALSO be part of a plan, they were suggested for the motivational aspect.  Morerover, I was not suggesting that HE do a plan and come up with those things ... I was suggesting those things TO HIM ... IOW, I was doing the planning, if you want to look at it from a planning aspect.<br><br>As to planning, had he developed a plan (using either of the techniques we have been discussing) it would be likely that the items I suggested would have found their way onto his list.  In which case, he would have to decide when to execute them.  In such case, if he executed them FIRST, they might work to motivate ... if later, they would serve other purposes but not the motivational one I had in mind (to get STARTED ... which I took to be his concern).<br><br>Finally, there is no reason I can imagine that those things might necessarily arise naturally.  It is possible that the items I suggested might not appear on someone's plan.  I don't think I've ever taken pictures of neighborhoods before a move.  But then, I've never needed to develop motivation to move ... I've always HAD to move for relocation or some such thing.<br><br>Of course, I can also see that the things I suggested might "organically" appear on someone's list.  I did not intend to, in any way, suggest that they would not.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>As to your response to Jacqueline ... <br><br>It can certainly be true that one can have some resistance to following one's plan.  However, I'm not convinced that the resistance is there because of the plan itself.  It is more likely that the resistance is there because one does not want to do the particular actions.<br><br>Now I do get your point that if things arise of themselves it might be the case that there would be less resistance.  However, suppose one feels that one must move.  That "thing", the "moving", is external to the planning process but also external to the "arising organically" process.  It is there because of some other reason and one might simply not WANT to move and thus be resistant to doing anything associated with it.  In such a case I'm not entirely convinced that one would have less resistance to tasks if they arose organically.  (In fact, I question if those tasks would even make it to the AF list at all.)<br><br>The way I see AF is that it is a way of managing discretionary time to accomplish a list of tasks.  I don't see AF as a motivational tool at all.  (I realize that some find less resistance to tasks using AF, and I don't  dispute that ... in fact I find that to be true in my own experience.  But I don't see AF as the ANSWER to procrastination.)  I see the answer to procrastination to be tools which have been long ago developed for THAT purpose ... chunking down, for example ... or listing lots of positive benefits ... or thinking of worst case outcomes to arrive at absurd limits.  Any of those tools have proven to be helpful.  And I certainly agree that being confronted with a "rule" that one must do a thing or stop thinking that one will do it at all is a creative way to help with SOME ASPECTS of procrastination.  <br><br>You said: "If one starts in the way Mike outlines above, then the plan will emerge naturally out of what one is doing and there will be much less resistance to it."<br><br>I have to think that in some, if not many, cases doing something dreaded will not simply occur to one and make it to the list.  Why would it?  I can see how eating ice cream might, but not "go pull the weeds" ;-)  And if "pull the weeds" makes it to the list for ANY reason, I don't see how "find weed thingie" would engender any more resistance if it entered the list because one thought about it and realized it would be necessary (planned for it) or if it just popped into one's head.  I would, in either case, dread digging through the long neglected garage to find that "weed thingie".<br><br>I wonder if this is not just a case of our being very different in the way we approach life.  Maybe it is more a case of some people being more likely to plan things and others being more likely to just jump in.  The quote Jacqueline offered about Tesla's view of Edison really drove that point home to me.  Tesla  planned everything.  In fact, he had the unique ability to actually model his machines in his mind, seeing them in four dimensions and really visualizing where they might break down so he could dynamically fix them (in his mind) and change his design to avoid the flaw before they were physically built.  He could no more NOT plan than, probably, Edison COULD plan.<br><br>Maybe you are the kind of person who would always order mint ice cream while I would always order chocolate?  In the end, we would both end up licking our lips with satisfaction ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>That confirms it ... we are VERY different people.  I always order what I like.  (This reminds me of a comment made by Joseph Campbell ... he said that when he and his wife went out to eat he always ordered the same thing and was always pleased while his wife tried new things and was usually not that pleased.)<br><br>I'll have to read that article later today.

<div class="content">Dm:<br><br><<the planner only won short-term because he persuaded other people that his way was better>><br><br>This is the problem with planning. It sounds totally logical that you should sit down at the beginning of a year and work out what your goals are for the year, then work out a monthly plan, then a weekly plan, and then a daily plan to achieve those goals. There's tons of software and goal achievement methods out there which are based on exactly those methods.<br><br>The trouble is that I've never met a person, including myself, for whom it works. I'm sure there are some out there for whom it does - it's just that I haven't come across them.

<div class="content">It's been interesting reading these posts.  For me planning is more about control and tracking.  Obviously if there is a project such as building a house there does need to be a detailed and very specific plan, but personally I have always struggled with the concept of goal planning.  Mark's description of being pulled by a goal rather than pushing towards it in "Dreams" really struck a chord in me.<br><br>When I started AF I imagine that like most people, both Mark and Mike included, I had a list (whether written or just in mind) of things/projects that I wanted to achieve.  Some of those, eg year end accounts, had a defined structure and specific outcome, with checklists and a known structure.  Others, like sorting my various hard drives and removing duplicate files, had a known outcome but still required a detailed plan, still others were more nebulous, eg setting up a new business.  The various stages at which these projects were (whether in mind or on paper) determined what I put on my lists.  I could have entered for example a task (enter Jun 08 account data) or a project (start new business).  The entry into AF started a process - which inevitably led to planning.<br><br>I have described that process in another post as more of a wave like process.  If a project becomes clear from a series of AF tasks (bottom up) then it generally gets worked on by planning and goes back into AF (top down).  The action or inaction on those tasks will inevitably at some point lead back to the drawing board, resulting in a swing between top down and bottom up.<br><br>Yes we are all different people and come at things from very different ways but it sounds to me that at the end of the day we are all planning in one way or another.<br><br>Renrew, as for how I personally have addressed those bigger unpleasant projects (and please see my post above (3rd in this thread) I have to say the key is flexibility - not to have preconceived ideas as to how it can be resolved but being prepared to be guided by intuition, listen to that intuition, act on that intuition and going back to the drawing board as often as necessry.</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>One thing stood out to me when reading your post above, well two things actually :-)  One was where you say "And if "pull the weeds" makes it to the list for ANY reason" which, taking that in the context of the surrounding comments seems to imply that you would not put things you didn't want to do on your list.  Is that what you are saying or have I misunderstood you?<br><br>The second thing was "The way I see AF is that it is a way of managing discretionary time to accomplish a list of tasks. I don't see AF as a motivational tool at all."  and "But I don't see AF as the ANSWER to procrastination"  That surprises me somewhat.  By putting "everything" on the list without grading, and by following the rules, then AF if allowed to, WILL identify reasons for that procrastination.  Yes techniques (tools) such as rewording etc are all very valuable and absolutely facilitate that process but it is the acting on the knowledge of reasons for procrastination that has been the key for me.  I find it hard to describe that as anything other than "the answer to procrastination".<br><br>AF is a way of managing discretionary time to accomplish a list of tasks but I genuinely believe it is much more than that.  Do you not agree?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>I'm not sure what to think about this whole thread.  I seem to find myself as an outsider defending something as obvious as setting goals.  I'm now reading that people such as Bill Gates do not have goals and plan!  It is all seeming somewhat bizarre.<br><br>But to your questions:<br><br>You Said: "One was where you say "And if "pull the weeds" makes it to the list for ANY reason" which, taking that in the context of the surrounding comments seems to imply that you would not put things you didn't want to do on your list. Is that what you are saying or have I misunderstood you?"<br><br>Yes, I did not mean to imply that "pull the weeds" would NOT make it to the list but that no matter HOW it made it to the list, the procrastination value attached would be the same.  IOW, I believe that going out in the heat of the summer to work on the yard is going to feel just as onerous no matter if I "planned" to do it or just gazed out the window and thought I ought to put it on my list so that I'd be prompted to do it.<br><br>You said: " By putting "everything" on the list without grading, and by following the rules, then AF if allowed to, WILL identify reasons for that procrastination."<br><br>I know you have said that frequently here and I have to say I've never figured out what you mean or how or why it would work that way.  I do not get any insight into why something is "tough".  I just do it because I know I need to do it and the frequent repetition of reviewing it somehow breaks it free.  If I have a special difficulty with something, I will most off chunk it down or apply some other technique I learned from some serious works on the nature of and solutions to procrastination.<br><br>You Said:  "Yes techniques (tools) such as rewording etc are all very valuable and absolutely facilitate that process but it is the acting on the knowledge of reasons for procrastination that has been the key for me. I find it hard to describe that as anything other than "the answer to procrastination"."<br><br>Of course I agree that acting is crucial ... if that is what you are saying.  But since I don't get any information from AF, I can't see how it is an answer to procrastination.<br><br>You Said:  "AF is a way of managing discretionary time to accomplish a list of tasks but I genuinely believe it is much more than that. Do you not agree?"<br><br>Not really.  What more could it be?  It is a task management methodology and it does that well.  I think it does it better than the others I've come across.  But all it does is help manage tasks.  I've waited long, and with much anticipation for it to do the laundry, but the hamper is now full and I think it is probably time for me to step in.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark, you said the following:<br><br>"This is the problem with planning.

For example, in University, this is exactly what I did as a single parent of a small child, working part time and staying on the Dean's list in order to get scholarships.  This is also how I've managed my investment / savings plans in order to be able to be financially set to retire if I choose at a relatively young age.  <br><br>It seems to me that where I did succeed with these methods was where the goals were very clear and could be put in a numeric context - ie. grades and finances.  If one knows that they need to save $24k/year, which translates to $2k/month, this is an easy target to know if you've hit it or not.  Track your spending, give yourself a weekly allowance, etc.   If I needed a 3.75 GPA, it was very clear what mark I had to get on an exam and how much I had to study to achieve that.  <br><br>Isn't this similar to tracking your word count when you write?<br><br>As I've said before though, this type of planning did not work for me at all for renovating my house, or doing housework for that matter, where using the type of "non-planning"  that I do with AF works better than I had even hoped for.<br><br>Oh, and Bill Gates does have a time management system of sorts:<br><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/30/news/newsmakers/gates_howiwork_fortune/" rel="nofollow">http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/30/news/newsmakers/gates_howiwork_fortune/</a><br><br>As an aside, if I had to spend my days like the "successful" people profiled in the article describe their schedules, I'd be jumping off the nearest bridge.<br><br>Renfrew, for big, hard or unpleasant projects, I usually find a way to push so that I have no choice but to keep on going.  Like in war, where an army would burn the bridge so there was no opportunity to retreat.  (I think it was General Cortez vs. the Aztecs?)   <br><br>I also think that some people will often let their imagination work against them and imagine the worst that can happen.  If I find myself doing this, I just think to myself "jump and the net will appear."  Everyone is fearful or avoids some things, it's whether you let that fear control and limit you or not.  <br><br>If the issue is that it is a major/big project like my house renovation has been, which will take a year to finish, and probably over 1000 hours and tens of thousands of dollars to do, I have to take my mind off that big picture entirely.  I have a list of basically which room I want to have finished in which month, but then I don't look ahead or track how I'm doing, all I care about is that this week the bathroom vanity will be pulled out and I will have hopefully chosen a new one to put in.  And when that's finished, I will look around me and find another little mini-project to tackle based on the weather forecast, my enthusiasm for the job and my work schedule.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>There is no need to feel that you are the outsider defending the obvious - all that is happening is that there is a clear miscommunication - what you and Mark are saying is not so very different but what you are both hearing is probably not what the other is meaning to convey - if that makes sense!  I have spent a lot of time working in the US and one thing that became clear to me very quickly is that we really are two nations divided by a common language.  I found myself in a position on many occasions where no matter how I phrased something I seemed incapable of explaining something which to me was patently obvious, and I have no doubt that that must have worked the other way around as well.  I was never able to work out why - it was not that either party was unintelligent, it wasn't anyone's fault but in the end I just had to accept that there were some things that were just unexplainable and leave it there.<br><br>Thanks for the clarification in your post.  I had misunderstood you regarding adding "nasty" items to your lists.  I thought I must have misunderstood - I'm sure we would have had lengthy discussions on the subject before otherwise :-)<br><br>When you say "I've never figured out what you mean or how or why it would work that way."  that actually does explain a lot.  To me that is the key to AF but then I have always always struggled with routine and structure without knowing why.  Clearly you and many others have a far greater ability than I to be self disciplined.  Maybe whatever it is in me that rejects self discipline is the very thing that enables me to "get" that aspect of AF - I don't know.  What I can see is that, if you are not experiencing that aspect of AF then you must see me as having pointy ears and be shaking your head sadly at some of my posts :-) <br><br>But oh dear Mike - if AF has not yet done your laundry - now that is sad ........<br>Live long & prosper :-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>Thanks for the interesting article about Bill Gates. What particularly struck me is that he talked about all sorts of ways of managing emails and communications, but he said nothing about the big picture at all. I would love to know how he deals with projects from conception to completion, and indeed how he arrives at ideas for projects in the first place.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br><<I'm not sure what to think about this whole thread. I seem to find myself as an outsider defending something as obvious as setting goals.>><br><br>I think Christine is right - we are divided by a common language. I have said over and over again that I have nothing against either goals or planning and yet you seem not to hear what I am saying.<br><br>What I do believe strongly is that both goals and planning should arise out of what we are doing and should not be set in stone by some sort of project planning methodology. From the examples you give it appears that you also believe this. So I don't know why you seem so set on disagreeing with me!</div>

<div class="content">Renfrew:<br><br><< So what is this "decisive factor" , this "extra ingredient" the "magic potion", if there ever is any? >><br><br>Interesting question. And in order to try to answer it I looked at the three people you mentioned in order to see what it was they were trying to achieve:<br><br>In the case of Obama it seems at first sight to be obvious: "To become President of the United States". But was that actually his goal? What was he aiming to become President of the United States for? It's not so obvious to me what his goals are for his Presidency. To usher in world peace, love and the brotherhood of man? (sorry, I don't know what the inclusive language version of that would be!)<br><br>The Dalai Lama: to restore independence to Tibet? In that case, so far he would be perceived as a failure.<br><br>Bill Gates: to become the richest man in the world? Was that actually his goal? Somehow I doubt it. So what actually was his motivation?<br><br>I think the one thing they all have in common is the ability to grasp an opportunity when they see it to - to ride the crest of a wave. As Steve Jobs said often you can only connect the dots when you look back. I've discovered in my own life that often I can only understand where I'm heading by looking at where I've been!</div>

<div class="content">It seems to me that in order to progress at or in anything there needs to be both the ability to take charge, and a willingness to grow.  All three of the above are people of influence and in positions of power.  Too many people aspire to positions of power because of the element of prestige and status rather than for the ability to influence for good.  It seems to me that those who best fulfil their highest potential are those that retain the ability to use their power to develop the best in others and make a difference.  That requires more than average flexibility - not to act according to whim or peer pressure, but to act decisively whilst constantly reviewing, improving upon, and adapting strategies.<br><br>Although through my career I have had goals and targets, I did not start with a clearly defined career plan - my goal as it were was to be the best I could be at whatever I did - and to enjoy my work.  It always felt as though I fell into my career path by accident, but it was always a case of acting upon opportunities as they arose - and being willing to take a risk; less a case of "this is the obvious path" than "how much will I regret this if I don't give it a go?"  Whilst as Mark says, it is often only on looking back that you can see how paths have evolved, at the end of the day for me it comes down to those intuitive actions as opposed to rational "common sense".  I suspect that all those who make a difference will have taken steps that others would have thought crazy.</div>

<div class="content">This conversation makes me think of the basic structure often taught for writing a screenplay.<br><br>Main Character lives ordinary life, perhaps vaguely wanting a small change in his life.<br>Something happens that allows the character to move toward that small goal.<br>He fails or succeeds and it seems like life will settle down, except--<br>That new change has opened a can of worms that now he's REALLY got to deal with.<br><br>The can of worms then becomes the character's goal for the rest of the movie.<br><br>When the audience can say "yes or no" he reached that goal, the movie is over.<br><br>Point being, he doesn't have a goal until circumstances helped create a goal for him. That sounds rather like the Obama story. Who'd have thought a few years ago, he could be president? Did he himself? But he gave that big speech on TV that got everyone saying "Hey, check out this guy." He carpe'd the diem and dealt with the can of worms--he had a goal (at that point) to become president.<br><br>Take from it what you will!</div>

<div class="content">My problem with planning is that I rarely know all of the steps toward the goal. If I do know the steps, I just do them and don't see the need to write them down (I realize in a work situation where you are accountable to others then different rules apply). But, most of the time I don't know the steps to reaching the goal. I may know the first two or three actions, and usually those are of the "learn/read more about goal XX". I find that by actually *doing* the first step, I learn a little bit more about the project, and it triggers a few more ideas, makes me aware of more things that need to be done and to avoided. And given that we can only do one thing at a time, then aren't we fine with just two or three more "next actions" toward our goal? <br><br>     I liken a project to a conversation. When you think about those great conversations that last a couple of hours, isn't it obvious that the things being talked about at the heart of the good long conversation could never be planned? If I think about calling up a friend of mine, I don't really *plan* the conversation, other than possibly one or two things I wanted to mention. If the conversation goes according to plan, it probably ends in 10 minutes, and there is no *discovery* or learning. But the best conversations are those where those one or two basic *seeds* trigger other subjects, which in turn lead to more subjects, and eventually lead you to the core (a few hours later) of what you *really* wanted to talk about -- and you had no idea it was lying dormant in your mind, ready to be discussed. <br><br>     So, for me, AutoFocus is like starting 50 potential *conversations* (projects). Most will fizzle fairly quickly, maybe five or 10 I will stick with for a longer stretch, and of those, maybe one or two will turn into real long-term projects that might bear little resemblance to the original ideas that triggered them -- like the subject of your conversations after the two-hour mark.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a believer in some type of hybrid here - yes, I can see the conversation analogy - in a conversation where there is no "goal" per se, but I can't see its application in business - a meeting without an agenda is usually a pretty non-productive meeting.<br><br>I'm just happy to use whichever method I can - if I can use the intensive planning and stick to it and have a very clear goal, my progress will likely be faster and less costly, particularly if I remain flexible to what I learn from previous steps.  If I'm not clear, or am facing resistance of some sort, I'll use the other approach.   <br><br>Christine, I thought that you tended more towards the planning mindset as you indicated in the mindmaps and other threads?  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I love planning - and love to have a visual means of identifying what needs to be done and what progress has been made - BUT I don't like overplanning.  For example, taking the conversation analogy, I may have a list of topics I want to talk to Fred about but would not script the planned conversation.  As the conversation developed so the points I had listed would probably be amended or be seen to be superfluous.  If however the planned conversation was a scheduled conference call then there may be a need for a formal agenda and for that conversation to be more specifically managed, recorded and reported on, according to a previously agreed and defined process.<br><br>With AF I have the best of both worlds - that wave effect that I mentioned.  With regard to personal, as opposed to group projects, I would generally start with some sort of vague plan, but in a fairly nebulous form.  For example - I have a project to sort my Digital Files (and I have a lot, from media files, to scanned images, to email, to accounts files, to historic business files etc etc).  I start with my project/goal which I just call something simple like "Sort Digital Filing".  My planning at this point is simple - a list of a few items - Identify File Locations, Catalogue Hard Drives, Define File Structure, Create Schedule.  Any or all of those will then go onto my AF List.  As I work on those items I discover new things that I need to do.  For example I find that I need to obtain specific software to read certain files.  I identify the various locations so can now break that task down to Catalogue Toshiba drive, Catalogue LaCie drive etc.  What I am finding is that I then set a task to review my original plan; I redefine it, add or delete items on the original list, create a more detailed plan/schedule, and then start adding those tasks into my AF list.  My plan is therefore growing organically - fed by AF - is then redefined and in turn feeds back into AF.<br><br>As another example of planning, I have a few deadlines to meet this coming week, and friends visiting on Monday, necessitating cooking and similar tasks.  The tasks are on my lists and I have plenty of time, but knowing I have a number of varying tasks and erratic discretionery time tomorrow, I wanted something more visual to focus on.  I therefore drew a MindMap of the numerous things to be done and put it up on my desk.  I am not working from that map or using it instead of AF but as I clear the associated tasks within AF, which I will do as I cycle through (I am working at the end of my lists at present!!!) then I will highlight the relevant MindMaps entries.  That will just give me a visual progress report which I find really helpful.<br><br>I think the main point of the planning debate is that different circumstances require different approaches and the key is flexibility.  A group requirement, or a complex project will require more detailed planning at an earlier stage.  The method of producing that plan may vary, but at some point some form of plan is normally essential.  I suspect that a lot of the misunderstanding comes down to definitions of plans, projects, and goals, and what we see as a "normal" process of creation in those areas.</div>
