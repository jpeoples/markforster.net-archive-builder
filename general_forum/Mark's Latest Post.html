<div class="content">Great summary of the AFxs. I switch between 1 and 2 since my work varies from urgent, externally imposed deadlines, to self-directed work.<br><br>The ease of the switch is brilliant. <br><br>That's the problem with AF, it's so simple, elegant, and effective that there is not much to say other than commenting on others' personality types and foibles on the forum.<br><br>Grateful that Mark offered this so generously.</div>

<div class="content">So how would you summarize DWM?  I guess it gives a time measured way of gestating items and dismissing them?  I'm still trying to psych it out.</div>

<div class="content">Curiously, Mark updated the AF index, and homepage but doesn't mention DWM anywhere.  I guess it's not considered ready for publication as a finished system?</div>

<div class="content">I'm managing quite happily without AF/DWM, I'm sure others are too.<br><br>AF/DWM may be best for some people and GTD best for others.<br><br>For me I just need to cover:<br><br>1) Tasks for doing today<br>2) Tasks for doing in general<br><br>I think that just about covers what AF/DWM does.</div>
