<div class="content">Hi all<br>I've bought myself some excellent books based on the recommendations in some of the posts here.<br>However when I search for the term "book" with the search function I cannot seem to recover much.<br>Would anyone else like to have a dedicated thread for recommended boooks?<br><br>For starters I would recommend "Mindset" by Carol Dweck which I am still reading and purchased after following a recommendation on an earlier thread.It's about creating the right mindset for success which I am finding an enjoyable read.<br><br>Cheers<br>Jay</div>
