<div class="content">Mark, are you okay?  You don't seem to be saying hardly anything about AF4 and where you are with this.  Any new directions?  <br><br>Mark, I do hope you are well.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Mark:  Ditto.  I think as a group, those of us who frequent the forum miss your advice and also wish you well.<br><br>On a similar note, has anyone heard from ChristineB?  She always had plenty of comments and a passion for AF.  But she had some health problems earlier this summer.  I wish her the best.</div>

<div class="content">Posing as Sherlock Holmes, I deduce that Mark is on a tour of the continent, based on these entries from his AF4 demo list:<br><br>Check details needed by Travel Agency<br>...<br>Camera Manual<br>...<br>German 24/3<br>...<br>Spanish 13<br>...<br>Portuguese 17/2<br><br>What do you think, Watson?</div>

<div class="content">Not to pick a nit, but Watson doesn't say Elementary, Holmes does. ;)<br><br>--Moriarty</div>

<div class="content">Clearly working on a new system.....probably one that will blow AutoFocus away and maybe outside the realm of AutoFocus altogether.  Mark is a genius at this time management stuff.</div>
