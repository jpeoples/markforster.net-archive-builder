<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I'm in the final stages of producing an analog tool that combines elements of CBT/Mindfulness, productivity and journaling, all with a David Seah-esque aesthetic (thanks to my graphic designer). It is not meant to replace any productivity system per se (you can use it with GTD, AF, etc). But the function of the worksheet/rules is oriented towards answering one question: How did my week go? <br><br>I'm looking for a 1-2 people who are willing to try the form/system and provide feedback . If you're interested (and have the time), please email me at avrum AT nadigel DOT com<br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">I don't feel like I have the time or attention to give to a beta right now, but if this document is as useful as the last one, it is worth folks' time to contact Avrum - the one I helped with was good stuff and I'm still using it.</div>

<div class="content">R.M.<br><br>I had no idea that anyone is still using those tools. Thanks for sharing. <br><br>I have to say, the new worksheet(s) really bring to life the meaningful-productivity ideas that I have been mucking around with. And they're sure pretty - which will pose challenges re: printing. <br><br>Anyway, thanks for the endorsement.</div>
