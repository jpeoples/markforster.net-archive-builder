<div class="content">Hi Gerry, <br><br>I really like 'Do It'. Concise and insightful. <br><br>Do you follow this approach at the moment? If so, what tangible results have you had (if you do not mind sharing)?<br><br>How do you deal with all the other stuff that needs to get done, i.e. what Time Management System do you use, if any?<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Gerry: like Leon, I liked it very much too. It recognised some echos with Mark's work in "Dreams". For example, the "gaps" and how to fulfill them would be Mark's "Present Reality", while the achievements for today would correspond with "What's Better Today" list.<br><br>I like the way you've presented it into a series of very simple actionable steps. I'm definitely giving it a go...Thanks for a great E-book!</div>

<div class="content">Leon and JD<br><br>Thanks for the feedback.  I am using the approach now to write another ebook and on some interpersonal relationships.  I have used it to switch jobs, improve relationships and on the creation of the ebook.  As far as time management, I am using the Steno Notebook approach I wrote about in the ehow article, which is a minimalist approach and I find all I need at this point.<br><br>I have not read dreams, but I did try to reduce the book to very actionable steps and provide people with an exact method to follow, which I found lacking in many of the self help stuff I have read previously.  <br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry,<br><br>Thank you for your response. I agree with JD, it is very well presented and it's very easy to follow. I'm looking forward jumping in! <br><br>Gerry, could you see any problem with having 2 Desired Outcomes rather than3? The reason I ask is because I keep coming back to the idea of only having 3 things to focus on (from the 'not insane' to do list concept). I have been organising my day around:<br><br>1: Review and Respond (Yesterday's emails, voicemails, paper, tasks - as per DIT) - timeboxed<br>2: Current Initiative (DIT again) - timeboxed<br>3: 30 Day Challange (Leo Babauta)<br><br><br>I was wondering if this approach might work:<br><br>1: Review and Respond<br>2: Desired Outcome<br>3: Desired Outcome<br><br>I find the Review and Respond slot minimises the amount of time spent on the tasks that really *need* to get done. <br><br>Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks again for allowing this discussion.  I am hoping to improve my site and get a discussion board going.  I may just do something simple like facbook, but I will I will let people know so they can get their questions answered. <br><br>As far as Leon's question goes, The method works for 1-3 desired outcomes just fine.  I really separate this method from my time management and use it for longer term goals.  So I use a time management system for work and currently use DO for personal goals, which I typically work on during lunch or after work.  The DO system is really designed to be a way to identify desired outcomes or goals, then quantify why you are not there yet and then create a simple action plan and feedback loop to motivate you and keep you on target to achieve them.<br><br>Like the TM systems I have devised, the method was generated to help me overcome specific roadblocks I encountered so I could accomplish things while keeping life simple.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry - I'm having trouble seeing the "resource gap" in my particular situation, and it would be great to have your point of view. <br><br>I begin a mid-life career change soon, and one of my goals is to excel at my new position. Obviously, there can't be a resource gap on something you haven't started, nothing specific. But it stands out as something I want to prepare for mentally, as the new corporate environment will be totally alien to me, after spending much of my life as my own boss.<br><br>Any thoughts?</div>
<h2>Reply by Gerry</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-13 15:45</div>
<div class="content">Congratulations on the new position, getting the new position is the realization of a desired outcome.  A new one will be excelling in the new position.  This is an example of a "soft" desired outcome at this point in time, as you don't have "hard" outcomes like in lets say a sales position with revenue goals. <br><br>My suggestion would be to treat the preparation for an first few months as a desired outcome based upon the issues you see, such as  preparing for the return to the corporate world, which would be learning the specifics of the position and the particular business and systems as well as the things you need to do to mentally prepare for the new position.  Once you get up to speed, I see a job transitioning to whatever TM system you employ when you are comfortable.  I hope this makes sense and is helpful.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="meta">2010-04-14 8:14</div>
<div class="content">Gerry: Thank you, yes your comments were very helpful in confirming what I suspected in the 1st place - soft goals require in-depth thought about what the markers are in seeing your objective fulfilled. <br><br>So, in a sense, its easier to write about how to make a million bucks, as opposed to how to become a person of courage and fearlessness...that's why they say it doesn't take brains to become rich!</div>

<div class="content">Hi JD & Gerry,  <br><br>I was thinking about your question, <br><br>Often networking / meeting Colleagues is an early goal (or Desired Outcome!) when starting a new job role. <br><br>This sort of Desired Outcome could be quantified by saying something like 'I will aim to find out the name and job role of 80% of the deparment team by 30th May 2010', for example. <br><br>I gues the trick with a qualitative goal is to look for something that can be quantified in some way? <br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">And another thing...<br><br>Mark has some great archive articles on 'getting to your goals' on this site. <br><br>I particularly like the idea of allocating milestones a percentage score. <br><br>This worked for me last year when buying my christmas presents. The task of obtaining My Mum's christmas presents is always onerous. It accounted for something like 40% of the goal. So after completing this milestone, I had 60% of the goal to finish, or to fill the gap.</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-14 17:04</div>
<div class="content">I don't believe in percentage complete myself.  I do believe in assigning points for full completion though.  So Mum's present is worth 40 points, and Dad's is 10 points or whatever.  The distinction is twofold:<br><br>1. You only get points for finishing something.  So those subgoals need to be concrete, and you can't claim "room is half-clean", as a nebulous half-done doesn't count for much.<br><br>2. It doesn't necessarily add up to 100.  You can do smaller projects for smaller points, and combine several [complete several] for bigger points.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry, <br><br>A question for you re Do It Process: <br><br>What would you advise doing with the ripped out pages (with the potential Desired Outcomes on them)? <br><br>a) Keep them and refer to them when ready to select a new Desired Outcome<br>b) Discard them and write down a fresh list, ripping out the pages from the notebook in the same way<br>c) Something else? <br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="meta">2010-04-15 15:42</div>
<div class="content">Great question.<br><br>I make a file with them.  I then review them as a refresher as I start a new notebook if I have less than 3 active desired outcomes.

<div class="content">"Makes sense!"<br><br>Glad it does to someone. This does fly in the face of most of AF.<br><br>Can someone who has practiced one version of AF for longer than six months faithfully and this one explain the merits of the above?<br><br>Frankly, I see nil. 2 vs. 3 outcomes? "Hard" and "Soft" "desired" outcomes? Point reward systems? Isn't this exactly the kinda nebulous and arbitrary trappings which are avoided in AFx?  <br><br>The absence of this kinda hodge-podge of "tweaks", "hacks", and imprecise language is what I find to be of great benefit in AFx.<br><br>This is the stuff of discussion.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure there has to be a rigorous discussion, does there? <br><br>If my views are of any use at all to you, Norman U, my preference was, in the end, to move away from AF (any version) as *for me* I did not feel good about having a long list of tasks (even with dismisal). It tended to add to my anxiety and procrastination. It just did not suit me. <br><br>Just my view, and I'm not really seeking a big debate about it.</div>

<div class="content">There doesn't have to be anything, but for something to be useful, it does help to have to be something more specific than some generalizations about "techniques" which have been discussed into the ground.<br><br>Just didn't see any compelling reasons to consider the product offered and asked for some.<br><br>There might not be any.<br><br>Why is "anxiety" bad? And what is "procrastination"? How do you know that AF would not help you to discern what these two things mean to you? How long did you use it and to degree of fidelity?<br><br>These are interesting questions and helpful. <br><br>Procrastination seems to mean for people as far as I can see: not doing what they don't want to do.<br><br>Hard to believe anyone would do that.<br><br>I am not sure outside of constant search of novelty that anyone seems to have gotten around this truth for any significant amount of time.<br><br>AF in the long run IME takes procrastination out of the equation, because what I want to do doesn't enter a whole lot into the system. <br><br>In short, I am not sure how any of the above suggestions are compelling, clear, new, or elegant in their approach to "getting things done". <br><br>AF for sure is compelling, clear, and elegant.

<div class="content">Good points Norman, thank you for your thoughts.<br><br>Personally I feel Gerry's product has value, for what I'm looking for. I suppose it's difficult to make an informed choice unless enough is known about it?<br><br>Believe me, I have used AF for a long period, but I keep coming back to the same conclusion. <br><br>Anxiety does have its benefits, particularly in response to an urgent situation. Yet for me there comes a point where chronic anxiety grinds me down. Anxiety can also be associated on one hand with higher levels of energy but a more negative mood state. This is not necessarily the mindset to be in for working on tasks. A better position to be in would be a feeling of action, or calm. <br><br> <a href="http://lizmiller.co.uk/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lizmiller.co.uk/</a><br><br>As for Procrastination: Basically, as an 'average person' unfortunately I have many tasks that I *must* do. I've found that putting them onto a list is (for me) just another way of delaying them. And I hate repeatedly seeing them on a list. I'd much rather just try to dispatch then as soon as possible. Which for me is generally the next day. <br><br>And personally I do experience more enthusiasm and focus having 3 main goals, or 'Desired Outcomes', rather than a long list.</div>

Turning dreams, visions or ideas into actionable steps. Some are obvious (the quantifiable goals), others are less so. <br><br>I see a lot of Gerry's ideas coming out in similar fashion in Mark's "Dreams" book. The need to motivate, provide feedback on your progress and keeping up movement and momentum enough that there is some measure of progress towards your dreams.<br><br>And AF serves a very vital function, providing the means by which movement happens on those items you have measured.</div>
<h2>Reply by Norman U.</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-16 15:04</div>
<div class="content">JD,<br><br>I know exactly nothing about Mark's _Dreams_ book. But as I see it in the instructions and practice of AF, dreams, visions, and ideas (whatever these are supposed to be) do not inform the process very much. They can explicitly and implicitly, but I find that over time such fantasy is quickly tempered by a more concrete based relationship reality.<br><br>Also, I find motivation to be antithetical to AF, unless one simply defines as some sort of tautology: you are doing something therefore you must be "motivated" to do it. Unfortunately, I am told that now is not the time to draw this out. Maybe another thread.<br><br>I also would suggest that explicit measurement again while certainly informing the "standing out" aspect of AF, does not govern it. If it does, then you are doing incorrectly (or are developing and testing the system in the manner Mark does as he unveils his new ideas).<br><br>Leon,<br><br>Your post is helpful in its honest disclosure and probably best handled elsewhere since the 30 post limit unfortunately puts a damper on any extended discussion especially when some of the posts are simply empty comments from folks with little opinion other than useless criticism.<br><br>As someone with an often over-active sympathetic nervous system, I can relate to the grind of persistent "low level" anxiety. AF for me, initially caused a greater degree of anxiety. Seeing a huge list of stuff I had to do. That was just it. I didn't have to do anything. I truly mean this. When I began to see AF as a short hand for my relationship to the world around me and my possible interactions with it, the anxiety dipped considerably. <br><br>You don't have to do anything. You just don't. Strangely, the more I take this seriously and practice it, the more I seem to get along with the world. My managers are happier with my work, my loved ones feel closer to me, I spend less time figuring out how to map out my life. Things stand out and I try my best to help out. <br><br>I was going to write up a concrete testimony that has happened over the course of the last year. A quite shocking turn of events. My "behaviorist" friends told me I was nuts in my approach, but I followed AF to the letter and substantial change happened which seems to please me, others, and as I can tell the environment around me.<br><br>Geoff,<br><br>The adults are talking. Strange thing about opinions: people have different points of view and through discussion they are exchanged. And not everyone feels the need to wring their hands and use windy circumlocutions to appease the imagined insecurities of others.<br><br>I start from the assumption that most people can handle direct discourse.<br><br>You are off topic by the way. If you want start a thread about me, go ahead. It seems to be the only thing you have to contribute. <br><br>Due to post limit, this is all I have on this. If AF suggests, that testimony might show up sometime over the next week.</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>I did not see where you asked for specifics about the new ebook.  It is a paper based 10 step program that provides a framework to identify three desire outcomes (goals) determine the reasons they have not been achieved and provides a simple way to begin taking action on them each day to make them become as I say realized outcomes meaning they are done.  It is a method I have used to achieve several important goals in my life.  Like my TM ebooks, they are systems I designed to improve my life and now I am sharing them.  Unlike other methods this is intended to be pragmatic and get people moving as opposed to analyzing limiting beliefs and attempt to fix the past as a way to achieve things.  Yes, I do take to task the "law of attraction" group in this, which I feel has done harm in their idea thoughts are things which has too many people sitting around trying to "manifest" their desires.  It takes the approach you are where you are so accept reality and get moving.<br><br>I am not a therapist nor do I have any training in this area, this is just what I have used to make things happen.  I hope the method works and people find it of value.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Good posts Norman.  The question of what we want to do vs. what we do is an interesting one.  Also the question of whether and how we should motivate ourselves.  I think we'll need to take this to another thread.  <br><br>It also seems Gerry has some interesting ideas on how to take a planned approach to achieving what you want achieved.  This is a valuable concept to me.  Often in order to get someplace you need a more thorough understanding of the goal, its reason, and the route.  This is outside the domain of AutoFocus, but complementary.</div>

<div class="content">Please stop complaining. Please stop complaining about complaining.  7 of the past 8 posts (including this one) have no valuable content.  Okay I'll stop now.</div>

<div class="content">LOL ;-)  Are you saying: "Don't feed the trolls?"  ROTF ;-)  And one has to wonder about statements like "all the great contributors are now gone" assuming that those posting now are not great contributors.  Norman is.  You are.  I KNOW I am ;-) ;-)</div>

<div class="content">My guess is that many have left because they're not using one of Mark's systems any more.  They don't want to come on here and say "this didn't work for me" and have someone tell them that they must not be doing it right or whatever.  So they say nothing.<br><br>And there aren't a whole lot of generalist time management topics to discuss here as it seems all roads must lead back to AF/DWM.  It's a scary world here for the prioritizers or people who plan their days.  <br><br>Gerry, just a comment, but I don't know that I would charge at all for the information that you've got on your blog.  There's just too much free information out there that people can access.  I'd be focused on building up a rep first rather than scaring away potential customers with charging them.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>To clarify,  everything on the blog is free, which is all of the articles I have written as well as access to two free time management ebooks.  I only charge for my latest ebook which is on goal achievement. <br><br> Thanks<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

I'm sad if you are finding the group norm to be hostile.<br><br>The Group Norm, of course, is something else again.<br><br>I'm afraid I do still find DWM helpful, though I am doing it wrong as well.</div>
