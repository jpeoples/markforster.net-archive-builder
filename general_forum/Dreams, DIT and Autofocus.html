<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I was very interested to see in the blog post "Good news and Bad News" (see link below) that you've developed Autofocus as a result of revisiting "How to Make Your Dreams Come True". I always liked the idea of "Dreams" but found it hard to make it work as I would end up in drift mode rather than pull mode if I tried it. However, with Autofocus I find it much easier to keep forward motion and although I haven't even been following it completely due to some other projects hijacking my time lately, I am very impressed with it and after this week should be able to make it work more as it was intended.<br><br>If you have the time I'd be very interested (as I'm sure would others) to understand a bit more about how you developed the ideas behind Autofocus from "Dreams"<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/5/29/good-news-and-bad-news.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/5/29/good-news-and-bad-news.html</a><br><br>Many thanks again for such a simple but elegant system that has none of the rigid structure that I couldn't face with other time management systems (including I'm afraid to say DIT) but enough structure that I don't find myself drifting as I did with "Dreams"</div>
