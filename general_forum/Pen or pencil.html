<div class="content">hi all,<br><br>This might seem like an off-topic topic but I'm wondering if there are any strong feelings one way or the other for pens vs. pencils.<br><br>Personally, I've always been a pen/fountain pen guy until the last few months.  I've recently switched to traditional wood-cased graphite pencils and 2.0mm lead holders.  For some reason, I find my mind works more nimbly and creatively with a pencil.  I don't feel constrained to 'get it right' with a pencil as I do with a pen.  I can  erase mistakes or even whole tasks as I finish/dismiss.<br><br>Anyway, thought I'd throw it out there and see what you all think.<br><br>best,<br><br>brett</div>

<div class="content">brett:<br><br>I've got nothing against pencils, but I think if I personally used them I'd spend a lot of time erasing in order to "get it right". With the ball-point I use at the moment I just cross out anything I get wrong and don't mind the mess!</div>

<div class="content">Must be some sort of kinesthetic-tactile mind-hand-feedback thing that makes me prefer felt-tip pens (fine liners) when writing at the office. In case when I run out of those pens I use a medium soft pencil (2B, resp. #1) or a gel pen (esp. at home).</div>

<div class="content">The obvious answer is a multipen with a mechanical pencil as one of the elements. I've been using my Pilot Dr. Grip 4+1 (black, blue, red, green + pencil) for a while now, and feel lost without it. Had to order it online – <br><br><a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-4-1-4-Color-0.7-mm-Ballpoint-Multi-Pen-0.5-mm-Pencil-Series-I-Silver-Body/pd/2267" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Dr.-Grip-4-1-4-Color-0.7-mm-Ballpoint-Multi-Pen-0.5-mm-Pencil-Series-I-Silver-Body/pd/2267</a><br><br>– because I couldn't find one like it at the local shops.  Now I'm contemplating an even more expensive one –<br><br><a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Metaphys-Locus-3Way-1-Color-0.5-mm-Ballpoint-Multi-Pen-0.5-mm-Pencil-Eraser-Black-Body/pd/4627" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.jetpens.com/Metaphys-Locus-3Way-1-Color-0.5-mm-Ballpoint-Multi-Pen-0.5-mm-Pencil-Eraser-Black-Body/pd/4627</a><br><br>– because it has a full-length eraser that you can click to extend, just like pencil lead. But it only has black ink.<br><br>Curiously, although I use pencil a lot for notes, errand lists, etc., I usually don't erase much; e.g., when I buy things I still cross them off the list, even if written in pencil.</div>

<div class="content">Pen, hands down.<br><br>Pencils smudge all over the heel of your (my!) hand. It's that simple. I guess pens do too, but not if you find a good brand.<br><br>When pencils are called for, the Zebra mechanical pencil is my pal, at 0.5mm with a separate "click" eraser. I hate sharpening pencils; as the lead gets blunter and blunter and I resist taking a break to sharpen it, it's like lying in bed having to go to the bathroom but not wanting to get up, all the while losing precious sleep.</div>

<div class="content">interesting.  I have no issues with smudging and actually am finding a pencil  more conducive to my productivity.<br><br>Anyway, i appreciate the great responses.<br><br>brett</div>
