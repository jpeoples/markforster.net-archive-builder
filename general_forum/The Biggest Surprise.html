<div class="content">Yesterday, I came across the shelf where all the books on time management etc. are that I have collected over more than 20 years. And to my own surprise, a thought popped up in my head like: "Now I can dispose of them all".<br><br>The next moment, I said to myself: "Wait, what's going on here?" I used to believe that time management - all this methods and theories and so on - had become some kind of a hobby, even a passion to me. I always liked to experiment with different concepts and methods.<br><br>But this seems to fade away. I look at these books and feel I am no longer interested in the subject. Thinking of it, I realized I haven't had one single look on all the "life hacker self organization super productivity" websites I used to visit, not since I started with AF.<br><br>So, time management wasn't really a passion. It was a quest, a search. And once you've found what you were looking for, it's over. And this is how I feel in the moment. It's amazing!</div>

<div class="content">Me too! I come to this site most days out of fun, not because I'm in desperately looking for a way to improve the way I work, like I did for most of last Sunday! I was going round and round in circles trying to get GTD to work for me and my search lead me to AF. I already had my book and pen which I had bought a few weeks ago with the intention of moving away from a computer based system (Things at the time) but could hardly bring myself to use. Within minutes of reading about AF I was up and running. <br><br>It's been a joy to write in my book ever since. I used to write down a project or next action because I felt I should but always had a nagging doubt that I was fooling myself. Would I ever look at it again? Would I ever do anything about it? Not now.<br><br>John</div>

<div class="content">maybe reading the books is just for the motivation, but still valuable. some people read books, others read forums...</div>

<div class="content">I must admit, I am still reading the books, and reading the forums.  I am amazed by the system, but I like the chance to look at it critically, by reading other texts.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Wow, whether intentional or not, you effectively used <br>many techniques of NLP to create a persuasive story.<br><br>LOL.  I know master practitioners who couldn't do<br>what you just did.<br><br>Bob</div>

<div class="content">Or maybe "NLP" just labeled what persuasive people were already doing successfully. ;o)</div>

<div class="content">Would you keep a book on vegetarianism if you found you operated best on a low carb diet?  Of course not!<br><br>I also have a lot of time management books, and I find that with the perspective and success with AF that I have now, I can more easily take what works and leave the rest.  For example, I no longer feel a sense of impotence / depression when I see recommendations to schedule in time management books.  Because oddly enough - now I find I can make myself stick to a loose schedule combined with AF.  I can schedule the AF time where I could never schedule myself to perform specific tasks.   <br></div>

<div class="content">I think the good TM books are still worth of reading. I mean the good books because they explore many aspects as for instance how to deal with others etc.  For instance,  someone mentioned Mark Forster's first or second book. While I won't buy it now I plan to read DIT a second time with a different perspective.</div>

<div class="content">Silvia - if you meant Mark's second book ("How To Make Your Dreams Come True") it is actually very hard to obtain. However it addresses different issues than AutoFocus - not how to get things done effectively, but what things to do, looking at life psychologically at a deep level.<br><br>I am sure Mark can put the above better, but I would say that using AF should not preclude reading this book, and its value is reflected in the difficulty you will find obtaining it (unless you already have it!) <br><br>Mark - I hope you are able to make it widely available again,</div>
