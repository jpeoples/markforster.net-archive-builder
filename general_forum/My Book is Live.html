<div class="content">Hello, <br><br>I just wanted to let everyone know that my book the Underground Guide to Success is now live on Amazon.  It is a slightly re-written version of my book on achieving goals previously called Desired Outcomes Implementation Technology (DOIT).  I am new to the Kindle thing and hope it looks good.  Also, I am allowing for a free preview period so hopefully people can check it out for free soon.  Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Why not give a summary of your book, main idea(s), how it differs from others...</div>

<div class="content">I consulted the preface in Amazon, and I think it's rather an article than a book ( only 26 pages), the author name is not mentioned at all.<br>I think it needs more work and refinment.<br>Also the price (4.99$) should be revised.<br>Best wishes.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for checking it out.  The book is a method I have developed during the last 8 years of my career.  Although I have written a bit about time management, I truly am more interested in the process of achievement and understanding why some people set and achieve lofty goals and others do not.  I developed the method which is described in the book as a way to help people quantify and achieve what is important in their lives.  It is a 10 step method which I have developed, tested and used to make achieve many of the important goals in my life.  The book is short because it really is a bit of my philosophy and then the process which is something that must be "done" to have it work.  It is not meant to be a lengthy piece.  You read it, get the ideas and the method and put it to work.  It is meant to be the first step of the journey and my hope is people want to get going quickly.<br><br>I actually wrote the book on airplanes when I would have a few hours of uninterrupted time to think and write.  The people who bought the original version and actually used the method had nice results.  <br><br>I have no idea how to price the book.  The method has brought me amazing results and my hope is it does the same for others.  I hope to be able to do a free preview and will report here first so those who are interested can get it.  Also, I did not use my real name or any name for that matter due to my desire to remain unknown.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I downloaded the preview to my Kindle app but it was essentially the same text that shows up in the web preview.</div>

<div class="content">It looks like Amazon picks the preview, which is a bit of my philosophy, as I mentioned the methods is what hopefully helps people, thanks for looking.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I'll give it a look, Gerry, but straight out, no one's gonna pay 5 bucks for 26 pages. I've seen books for 2.99 that were comprehensive, 235 page affairs.</div>

<div class="content">I went ahead an read it because it was available for free from Kindle Unlimited. (Kindle Unlimited is a subscription that gives you the ability to check out a selection of ebooks, up to 10 at a time, but as often as you want. A lot of these are short self-published e-books such as Gerry's book, but I kind of like those. They give me new ideas to work with, in fewer pages.)<br><br>My honest review is that the writing style is not very good, and there are grammar and/or usage errors everywhere. I think it would benefit from a professional editor.<br><br>I think the first chapter, about why The Secret is not true does not need to take up the first ~25% of the book. I, for one, already know about that.<br><br>I like the idea of focusing on 3 areas at a time.<br><br>I really liked the "Theory of Action" and its corollary.  Probably because I had also had a similar insight a few days before which was that at any given time, what I am doing is either moving me forward toward my main goal, or it isn't.<br><br>The book also discusses the idea that as you try to reach your goals, your relationships with people may change, and you may end up drifting away or cutting out certain people.<br><br>The actual method which is at the end, (and this is just a summary) is to list all goals, then narrow it down to 3, identify the resources that would be needed to reach the goal (there is an earlier chapter about resources), identify where the deficiencies are and why they exist, identify the 3 main things you can do to close the gap for each of those goals, then work every day to close those deficiencies (review your 3 goals each day to decide what to work on that day). It challenges you to do that for 100 days.</div>

<div class="content">Don<br><br>Thank you for reading and reviewing the book.  I will check back throughout it for grammar etc. The important thing about the book is using the method. When people use it their lives improve. It is meant to be a tool to help people. The real review can only occur after someone takes the 100 day challenge and sees how their life had improved.  Are you going to give it a try?  Thanks <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry  - I bought the book and am implementing it, thanks!<br><br>Just wondering about the 3 daily actions...is it meant to be one per goal or 3 per goal? or a total of 3 actions spread across the goals (e.g. 2 tasks for one goal, one for another, and zero for the other goal)?<br><br>What happens if you complete a goal? Do you do just 2 actions per day?<br><br>Thanks, Joe.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Joe, <br><br>If I remember correctly: You have one daily action step per goal -- so that would be three action steps per day. If you hit a goal then you do not add another until you start a new notebook. (I think that is correct).<br><br>I like Gerry's work -- it's a good system!</div>

<div class="content">Funny I somehow got the thought to check the forum and found your question.  Thanks for checking out my ebook.<br><br>If you are reading the Underground Guide to Success the system is actually three large life goals and not daily goals. It is more of a life achievement system as opposed to a time management system.  So these are intended to be things like start a business, get a graduate degree, get out of debt etc.  the system is designed for self reflection and constant feedback to keep people on track to accomplish big things.<br><br>For TM I have been using with great success Forward Motion Time Management which I wrote about in a post on this site and on my blog.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br>I don't know if it affects anyone else, but your article on Forward Motion Time Management on your blog appears on Firefox as one huge paragraph. I haven't checked it on any other browsers.</div>
