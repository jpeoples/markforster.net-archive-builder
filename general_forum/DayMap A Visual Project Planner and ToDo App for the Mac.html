<div class="content">I contacted Mark about reviewing DayMap and he was gracious enough to suggest I put something on the forums. So here it is.<br><br>DayMap (for Mac and iPhone) is a new way to organize your projects and tasks by visually mapping out your life, one week at a time. DayMap allows you to see your projects, tasks and schedule in an intuitive and user friendly interface.<br><br>You can download our free version, DayMap Lite, from the Mac App Store. Find out more about DayMap at <a href="http://www.whetstoneapps.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.whetstoneapps.com</a> . Let me know if you like it. I'll send you a code for a free copy of the Mac version.</div>

<div class="content">Being an Android and PC man, I can't try this out myself so it would be interesting to have some Mac users try it out and comment.</div>

<div class="content">I've extensively tested many task/calendar apps. Mostly on the iPhone, some Mac OS applications & web. Apple's Calendar, Google Calendar & maybe few more web based systems. I believe I have good understanding of all the "types" of applications.<br><br>The main problem I find with everything I've looked at is the product is calendar OR task/outline. Sometimes is both, but the tasks are one list and calendar is another list. Or a task might turn into a calendar item when give a date, but not remain both. I've sketched out ideas for what an app should be for me & tried to build that as paper system. I want to get a big picture of all my projects/tasks AND calendar at the same time.<br><br>The way https://teuxdeux.com/ shows dates and tasks is about perfect for me: TeuxDeux<br>A simple horizontal day list, where tasks are easily dragged from day to day. In use is somewhat too simple for me. As no overall sense of projects. https://trello.com/ which I have not used, looks to be the perfect project app for how I think.<br><br>What if someone mashed these two ideas together?<br><br>That is DayMap.<br><br>DayMap is deceptively simple, I'm already rapidly warming to it, the real test is of course to live with for a few weeks across multiple projects. Projects are on the top row, with simple drag/drop in/across projects and drag/drop TO the calendar on the lower row. When drag to calendar, it does NOT remove from the projects, so more of a drag/copy, rather gives a date to the task.<br><br>Also, I figured it out very fast, before watched info video. Well done. Not over complex. Works as expected. Clean design.<br><br>The best way to understand is to watch the video. Or if Mac based, just grab the app.<br><a href="http://whetstoneapps.com/tour/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://whetstoneapps.com/tour/</a><br><br>https://vimeo.com/87941694<br><br>Also, great intro video from Todd, that nails why I'm interested in this app. Nothing is perfect for everyone, and people understand information in different forms. I'm visual, a UI/UX & graphic designer. So analog beats digital watch for me. DayMap goes in that direction. I'll continue to test.<br><br><a href="http://youtu.be/HfzFKqTzork" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/HfzFKqTzork</a><br><br>I've not yet tested full paid app, which also has outline functions which I love. Am excited about that.<br>And I've not yet set up iPhone version with synch.<br><br>As for improvements, yes, have plenty.<br><br>Questions?</div>

<div class="content">Hi matthewS<br>The analog version is planner pad.  I didn't like that because I needed to always wear my glasses because the form requires very small handwriting.  Also, I needed to keep project notes, outlines, etc.  When life is complicated, I need a white board.  The planner pad has projects and their corresponding tasks on the top row.  The second row down is a list of tasks you have chosen for that day.  The bottom row is an appointment calendar.  Of course, there is no search function.  If Day Map had appointments included in their overview, that would be great....or they could allow you to input appointments in bold and bright distinguishing font along with the tasks for that day. (combining days's tasks and appointments of planner pad into one row).  Plus the computer version would be ideal because my handwriting is awful!  LOL!  Even before the brain damage, having an overview has always been ideal for me to facilitate thinking and deciding. With my brain deficits, a simple, clean (uncluttered)overview is almost essential.  Simply needing to turn to a different page or having to have more than one view on the screen can totally throw off my thinking. LOL!   This sounds promising if they develop it to allow you to include easy to read and discern appointments.  I'd be over the moon if planner pad offered an electronic version........DayMap seems almost close to it.<br><br>Maybe if they add appointments to the overview, I'd be willing to give it a spin.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Todd,<br><br>I'm PC / Android / Web, so can't test it.<br><br>One other thing that most systems lack: Record the date you finished, not the date you updated the notes.<br><br>If the app is doing double-duty as a diary, or if you have tasks with a repeat based on last done time, and you want to spend time away from the computer, or, Heaven-forbid, the computer is down, then you need to enter the date you finished the task, not just the date you next turned on the computer.</div>

<div class="content">Hello "learning as I go", YES, exactly what I was thinking. I held off on mention of that in first review since:<br><br>1. Knew I might be falling for my typical feeling of, if ONLY it had this feature, then this system/notebook/software would solve my problems.<br><br>2. I really was only several hours into it, so should give it more time. And even live with the system as is.<br><br>For me, tasks do not live in a void. Somewhere somehow they happen. So while I'm seduced by outline or list apps, ultimately I still need to schedule. These so far seem to be two different areas. Even with a "system" such as The Final Version or Getting Things Done, there is still a need to have an appointment book.<br><br>I've brought that up in this forum; how do I get a sense of big picture, gantt or pert chart, project life planning AND deal with actual schedule AND handle the NOW? Do any of these "systems" handle all? The answer is no, you still need a calendar, project system, goal/mission setting etc. Which I guess makes sense, as if it had everything I wanted, then there would still always be one more thing, that was left out for someone.<br><br>So it is interesting that DayMap moved this closer. There IS a powerful project/outline/task section. All of those may be scheduled on a VISUAL calendar. (not just a task list where dates may be assigned). User interaction is VISUAL. You can open a task and assign a date, as with any other system, but what really makes it work, is you may also visually assign a date, just drag the task onto the calendar. This helps with getting a sense of a project and how to arrange across time.<br><br>It is a calendar of dates, what if also had the hours/appointments?<br><br>re: plannerpads.com thank you, did not know of this product. DayMap is similar to this, without the hours.<br>From what I'm seeing of Planner Pads (not used, just from right now visit their web) The top row is for projects and tasks (as you said) for that week. In DayMap, the top row is also for projects, but NOT for any specific week. It would be the same row, no matter what week you are on. The second row is a calendar for week/month. And what tasks you do for day. There is no third row, no appointments.<br><br>Todd Cothran is interested in our feedback/ideas, so "I'd be over the moon if planner pad offered an electronic version........DayMap seems almost close to it." Perhaps explore refine what you are after.<br><br>Todd generously DID send code for free versions, (thanks!) so I WILL overcome my natural urge for if only one more feature, and take this for longer spin.<br><br>Matthew</div>

<div class="content">One thing I've already found IS excellent with DayMap. In both the upper project row and lower date row, tasks may be manually arranged in any order. Of course many apps let you arrange the order of tasks. And you may mark those tasks for due/date/today. Yet ON the actual date, there is NOT a manual sort order. Bummer. As the day itself is when you really need to order your tasks. DayMap DOES have manual sort of each day.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Matt<br>Thanks for the great reply.  My short term memory makes my brain really unreliable at times.  I even set alarms (if I remember) to remind me of meds, calls or appointments. My sense of time is terrible.  I like seeing my appointments and tasks.  For some reason, SEEING the time increments actually helps me to choose tasks that will fit in the space of time.  I also use time and timers to help overcome resistance or to help me pace myself.<br><br>You reminded me of another reason I gave away planner pad within 2 weeks......Having to rewrite the projects and tasks week after week. LOL!  I even thought of cutting the page to save me from having to rewrite.  I'm bullheaded when it comes to boring chores.  Rewriting the same stuff qualifies.  DayMap would definitely be a huge improvement......plus DayMap has color coding.  Color coding definitely helps me quite a bit.  I really think they are really on to something and mostly there.  I'm sure people with normal brains wouldn't mind having a split page showing their calendar on one side and Day Map on the other. LOL!  I also love that Day Map allows you to add collapsible notes.  <br><br>Yes, they are really on to something.  Most linear thinkers don't understand how beneficial (almost crucial) an overview is to a whole systems thinker.  LOL!   Day Map certainly does!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I love their placement of the task inbox on the LEFT side of the projects row.  Planner Pads and most others have such space on the RIGHT side of the page/window.   A left-handed whole systems thinker?  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Todd<br>Is there a legit means of downloading the lite version without having to use Mac App Store. (I'm still using Snow Leopard....never opened a mac account... I totally understand if the answer is "No!"  LOL<br><br>BTW, well done!  Day Map seems like it will really help those of us who truly do "think" primarily visually. Also, I love that your color coding is also like tag function. Using color as a cueing device truly facilitates instant recognition and grouping.  Thanks for sharing this app...even if I, personally, don't get the opportunity to give it a test spin.  I simply don't trust mac/icloud/dropbox,etc.....yet....*blush*</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Hi, Todd. <br>Please ignore the last post.  <br>I just discovered that the minimum requirement is 10.8 ....10.6.8 and it's dinosaur owners don't qualify.  LOL!  Still, if I ever break down and finally update to Mavericks (I hate hate hate dealing with mac's new os (since lion) being so ios like and visually distracting and candy app looking, icloud sync, etc...LOL)., I'll definitely enjoy giving Day Map a spin.  <br><br>Thanks for creating it and sharing it.  Well done!</div>

<div class="content">I like DayMap! The manual sort works fine but maybe some auto sort features might be useful (eg by project, by entry date). File and folder (and apple mail)  linking would be really awesome to projects and individual tasks to track work in progress. <br><br>More rich text options would be nice, for example for task entry. The default UI font seems to fine, which shows the care that Todd has taken.  I love the collapsible project option. <br><br>I've jumped in to purchase the app as a show of support. I've mentioned the file linking features to Todd and he's listening!  Keep it up Todd.</div>

<div class="content">I appreciate that Mark has allowed Todd to post information about his new app on this forum!<br><br>Just downloaded the lite version and it looks very promising. <br><br>Is there a way to drill down to a "today" view only? I know the whole point is to be able to see your week/month, but it would be great to be able to click onto Today and to see the full descriptions of my tasks.<br><br>Question to other users or Todd: Any tips for best practice if you have a large list of projects? It would be great to have everything on one screen...<br><br>Do you group them into super-projects or do you just scroll along the projects view?<br>For example, I teach several university courses and have several research projects -- each of which has a very long list of ongoing tasks. So I like to keep each of them separately. I also have a long list of admin projects. So I'm wondering how others prefer to handle this.<br><br>Todd... maybe an option for a grid view (i.e., cards), so you can see all projects at a glance, even if there are many?<br><br>I'm very much looking forward to trying out this app. I am very visual and think this may work really well for me.<br><br>Silvia</div>

<div class="content">I'll have a play with the app.  In the meantime take a look at ThinkingRock which is really intuitive for slicing your work across multiple views, eg today, this week, all delegated items which are for such and such a topic.  You can set this up however you want.  The latest version now includes its own JRE so you do not need system-wide Java installed to run it.<br><br>I used to use ThinkingRock years ago but switched to the simpler, single plain text file which I described a while ago and used for years too.  However work has got so detailed now, and I'm involved in so many more projects, that the plain text file became more and more work to maintain without giving me the views I need.  So I've resumed using ThnkingRock to manage the lot.  In the years I've not used it it's got even better.</div>

<div class="content">silviastraka, I did not see a way to drill down to today view only. you are able to hide the project view and only see the 7 days (week) view.<br><br>as for how to show multiple projects,  the opposite is also true, you can hide the week view and only show the projects view. each project can be collapsed.<br><br>TESTING COUNT: OK full screen on Apple iMac, I just counted 12 projects open.<br>Collapsed I created 48 project all showing at the same time. Do understand, collapsed means you will not see what the tasks are in the project. You will just be aware of what the projects are.<br><br>There are not any of the typical list functions, in pure list apps like toodledo.<br>Such as "Show me only priority 1-3 starred due next week across these 5 projects."<br><br>So I don't know of any approved way to work with this, but it seems to think along those lines will not get you anywhere. Instead, I suspect this encourages a different way of thinking.<br><br>The visual aspect of showing what is due. Because if you really think about it, tasks only happen in time. Take all of your research projects and admin projects and make each a project. Then within each project, arrange in rough order to get them done. (or not, don't obsess if not easy to solve, could just scan all lists). Then start putting each task out onto the actual calendar. May also arrange the order of the projects.<br><br>You could even schedule EVERYTHING. By placing all that are not easily scheduled out into some they must be done around this time. End of this month, means schedule for next month.<br><br>I'm not using long enough to know any of this for certain, but this feels like could be way to go.</div>

<div class="content">Oh I love this app!<br><br>Finally--finally!--a day planner with my iCal events AND a project list with tasks AND the ability to just drag tasks to a date.<br><br>Simple and VISUAL. <br><br>I really need to have my calendar/hardscape combined with my to do list and I love planning within the context of calendar days. I like to assign 3 or 4 tasks to tomorrow or a future day based on a rough DIT system but also capture tasks on a project basis. I have a lot of projects, which get pulled to and from the front burner as appropriate, and I want to keep capturing non-time sensitive tasks for these. I like to SEE my current projects and see what's simmering and what's cooled off. And I color code my projects and tasks so I can see the visual balance between Live (Blue), Teach (Orange) and Make (Green) and with this app the associated tasks also get color coded. Brilliant!<br><br>My only warning is, if you use iCloud sync and want your iCal events to sync AND you have two Apple IDs as some of us early iTunes adopters do, make sure you buy the app under your iCloud ID not your iTunes ID so that the iCal syncing will work properly.</div>
