<div class="content">I remember a discussion some time ago regarding the use of Kanban. If anyone is interested I have recently been introduced to an online task management system called Trello - go check it out - it couldn't be more like Kanban! You have to have some imagination to decide how to use it for your circumstances which is it's strength really as you can set it up however you like. You can also share your boards with others if you are working as part of a 'team'.</div>

<div class="content">Alison,<br><br>after reading Joel's enthusiastic "How Trello is different"  I created an account and tried to figure out how to use this Trello thing. But I'm at a loss, can't find a description how to use it for my personal to-dos. <br><br>This seems to be another super cool app that's useless for mere mortals like me.</div>

<div class="content">Rainer - go onto You Tube and search for Trello - there are loads of videos where people demonstrate how they are using it. It's quite personal really, but I have set up a personal board with (so far) todos, projects, useful (ie a card for business books to read, a card with personal books to read, travel list, gifts and for each of these cards I have a checklist on the reverse with the details - so or the books to read I have made a checklist of all the books I want to read which I can tick off as I read them). I've also got a list for shopping with a list for each room, once for me personally and so on.<br><br>I think the only problem with these apps is that they are so unstructured it relies on your having some imagination to see how it applies to your own life. I only really got it when I looked at some setups others had in their you tube videos.<br><br>I didn't realise someone else had posted about Trello - I'll go and find their post.</div>

<div class="content">Alison, thanks for the heads up to this https://trello.com/ . First I heard of it. Even though Joel's team have been working on this from august 2011, per <a href="http://blog.trello.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.trello.com/</a> .<br><br>Rainer, I don't think I will "use it for my personal to-dos". I'll be trying it out as "a (collaborative) project list" supplement to my main Evernote FV list. Its main description says ...<br>"Organize anything, together"<br>"Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process."<br><br>That Joel's posting from January 2012 was certainly gushing, and prompted me to at least try this out. So far I really like its "responsive interface" design <a href="http://blog.trello.com/building-trello-com-for-multiple-devices/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.trello.com/building-trello-com-for-multiple-devices/</a> , on my desktop and android sgs2.</div>

<div class="content">I know this is billed as a collaborative tool, and I know my brother is very taken with it. He runs an online business and has to work remotely with some staff - he also uses it with projects he and his wife are working on and this also works well.<br><br>Currently I don't need to work in this way, but it works great for me as an individual, but I also know that if I have to work with a customer on a project, then this is an option.<br><br>I also like that I can update and add things whilst out and about using my iPhone.<br><br>I also believe that this could be used for any of Mark's systems - and for FV you could have a list that you drag tasks to for your short list.</div>

<div class="content">Pretty cool Alisson. I'm going to sign up. In case you're interested, I was using something slightly similar called pivotal tracker for my kanban/agile workflow because it gave me a a bit of motivation to do more work each week. And provided realistic stats on what workload I could handle.</div>
