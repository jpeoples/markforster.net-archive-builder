<div class="content">This article explains what I have personally found to be true: good reasons do not motivate. <br><br>Short of imminent embarrassment, immediate loss, or immediate threats to your safety or the safety of loved ones, "purpose" (the reasons why you want to accomplish something) does not create follow through — even if you really want the result. The latest scientific research on motivation also reflects this. So I believe the "P" in Tony Robbins' "Rapid Planning Method" (standing for "Purpose") needs rethinking.<br><br><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/morty-lefkoe/motivation_b_3569774.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/morty-lefkoe/motivation_b_3569774.html</a></div>

<div class="content">In my WOOP post I point out how the WOOP method (Wish, Outcome, Obstacles, Plan) is simply RPM with an "Obstacles" section added into the sequence just before you create a plan. Perhaps the following would be better:<br><br>ROP:<br><br>Result<br>Obstacles<br>Plan<br><br>or<br><br>WOP:<br><br>Wish<br>Obstacles<br>Plan<br><br>or (humorously)<br><br>OOPS:<br><br>Outcome<br>Obstacles<br>Plan<br>Schedule (Set a date for completion)<br><br>I see the purpose behind the "Obstacles" section, but no longer see the purpose behind the "Purpose" section (the "Outcome" section in the WOOP method).</div>

<div class="content">To be clear, by "good reasons do not motivate" I meant when you have assigned yourself a goal and are faced with personal resistance, looking at a list of reasons you wrote previously on why you're pursuing the goal will not consistently fire you into action. It didn't for me anyhow. I'm still playing around with the idea though in case there's an approach using a purpose section that works consistently for me. <br><br>On the other hand, if someone else assigns the goal (usually their goal) and the good reasons, along with the threat of loss and the lure of gain, yes, you will become very motivated. Usually right around the deadline, and mostly to avoid the loss.</div>

<div class="content">Michael B.<br><br><< looking at a list of reasons you wrote previously on why you're pursuing the goal will not consistently fire you into action >><br><br>That's because the reasons we write down are usually rationalizations for decisions we have already made.<br><br>There's quite a bit in "Secrets of Productive People" about how to make decisions and how to identify the real reasons we are doing (or failing to do) something.</div>

<div class="content">ISSPE:<br>Investigate, Select, Plan, Participate, Evaluate<br><br>We learned that in Girl Guides for planning events. Investigate the options (often a brainstorm). Select one. Plan it. participate in it. Then evaluate it.<br><br>As you drill down and do each step, the process repeats, on a smaller scale. What to do this weekend? Camp. Where? Start again with I. What to have for breakfast? Again, start with I.<br><br>The Evaluate part is, to my mind, as important as the others. Once I learned that it takes twice as long to plan a camp as I'd expected.</div>
