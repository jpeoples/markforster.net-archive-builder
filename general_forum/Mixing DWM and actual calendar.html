<div class="content">Hi All<br><br>I am currently using AF4 and while it works better than GTD for me, find it a bit difficult to focus  on just closed list most of the time and tend to rewrite too many tasks. DWM looks very intriguing and I hope will work better. I am going to try it right after I find time to buy a day-based diary in a shop.<br><br>One thing that I am curious about is the possibility of mixing DWM with the actual calendar. Certainly precise meeting details such as conference call numbers and long lists of participants are better to be kept electronically, but if you anyway carry a thing that looks like a diary, why not to keep there some major things: anniversaries, plans for holiday days, etc?<br>You could separate calendar from DWM tasks e.g. by keeping "calendarish" notes always on the bottom or top of the page.<br><br>Do you think there is any danger in such a mix?<br><br>Artem.</div>

<div class="content">That is what I'm doing.  I do suppose it depends on the time frame you are used to working in.  IOW, if you like to see a month at a glance, then putting appointments on daily pages might result in them getting lost.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster proposes that the best way to deal with absentee days is to redate the pages.  If you follow that approach (and not everyone does) then putting appointments on the calendar date doesn't work that well.  Mark's suggestion is to write appointments just like every other task into DWM, but to write it with an explicit date/time.  It's counter-intuitive, but it can work if you are consistently working through all your pages every day.<br><br>Other options: put appointments on your wall calendar.<br>Or do what you suggest, but then you need a remedy for when you fall behind by missing a few days.</div>
