<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>On researching about how to handle projects in this forum, I came across these old threads:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623421" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623421</a><br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387</a><br><br>I thought about it, and, hmm, sure, why not!<br><br>Starting today, I am throwing...well...storing away my project files after transferring all into my AF.<br><br>And all while test-driving a new form of AF I just thought about a few days ago!<br><br>And if successful, I <just might> add my checklists and throw...err...store them away too.<br><br>Save me from my insanity! >.<<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the links they get me thinking. No answers yet. <br><br>As for you, are you thinking AF1 and some of your pages are actually projects?<br><br>As for your chcklists, keep them!  If you insert a checklist directly into your AF list, why not?<br>You're done that page when a column of checks is completed and then reinsert the entire page later. Though some checklists I think are better handled through hard triggers. When XYZ happens, pull out the corresponding checklist. Make a habit of this and keep this list completely separate from AF.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym & Alan (so far, there will be more!):<br><br>Interesting.  In my desire to stick to pen and paper, I changed to the ADOCs (UK, like Rollabind, maybe similar to Circa/Levenger, but cheaper?) last month.  These allow me to move pages around, but take up less room than 2/3/4 standard ring files.<br><br>My AF4 list (Personal and Work) and those (new) daily checklists are in a pocket-size book.  I did also buy A4 and A5 sizes as well which I may move towards because a small notebook will take a bit of strain if I move all my projects into it.  Maybe I'll think about getting an ADOCs paper punch, then I could use any paper including printed etc.<br><br>But certainly food for thought, this all-in-one approach, A4 might be the only size as I could include project notes as well as the checklist, actions etc.<br><br>This new approach is where the iPad would possibly help, but I have set myself against getting one for now, will wait till next year for Windows or similar devices.  I would still like to be able to use handwriting a la OneNote on a proper tablet, but without the weight and bulk of the tablet or convertible, ie the pad<tablet for weight etc.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Well...I searched again this forum, and this timed I found Mark Forster's own way of handling projects:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/700900#post795070" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/700900#post795070</a> and onwards.<br><br>This quote by Mark says it all:<br><br>"You use a separate list when you feel you need one. Would you use a shopping list when you go shopping? Would you use a packing list when you are packing for the holidays? Would you make up a call list, if you were calling prospective clients? Answer: you would if you felt you needed to. It's the same with any other project. "<br><br>Hmmm...<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Great link!  I really like Mark's approach here,as explained in his several posts in that thread. Now to figure out how to completely assimilate his thoughts.<br><br>My fav quote:  <<Indeed that may well be the case [that you already know what the project requires], but the purpose of an action list is not to tell you what you don't already know, but to break the project down into steps so that that you get a lot of successes along the way. The effect is to give you many small(er) tasks within the main project so that you are less tempted to want to return to the main list.>></div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Alan,<br><br><<The effect is to give you many small(er) tasks within the main project so that you are less tempted to want to return to the main list.>><br><br>Oh! I totally missed that one! Good eye there, Alan, that looks very important.<br><br>Now about that previous post of yours...I thought about it for some time.<br><br><<As for you, are you thinking AF1 and some of your pages are actually projects?>><br><br>I do not think that is a good idea...unless you can move pages.  You see, AF1 works by making each and every page before the last one to be closed lists; now since projects would be open lists, you cannot insert them as pages in AF1 without ruining the whole thing.<br><br>To be honest, my previous incarnation of the Maintenance Checklist was using movable pages (that's why I have a Rollabind notebook: to try if that will work) so that, in AF4 fashion, you move whole checklists as individual items in the list.  I also included my project lists there.  Suffice to say, it became too complicated and I rejected it.<br><br>Of course, anyone else who would want to try it is free to do so.  I think Post-Its will be of much help.<br><br>Anyways, my idea had been to stick it all in AF, without cohesion of any sort.  I think I may have been too rash.  Lemme think about it.<br><br><<As for your chcklists, keep them!

I've tried trying electronic means of time management, but it is with pen and paper that I really felt control with my time.  Sorry couldn't help you with that, I guess.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym <<Alan, I'm really excited to know what your project handling tweak is. I haven't done mine yet because I cannot visualize it in theory yet, so any tip how others do it would be really appreciated.>><br><br>I'm still refining how I handle projects, but I'm getting closer.  What I'm doing is in line with what Mark's posted in the discussion under "Using Resistance as a Guide" and as quoted/referenced above.<br><br>A project starts as a grouping of related tasks, or as a goal which needs tasks defined. I add a page for the project, give it a name, and reference that name in AF.  Within that page I write anything I want to.<br><br>When I encounter a project in AF, I may look at its page, and then decide whether to work on it.  All of these count as "Working on a project".<br>	- Defining or rewriting its goal<br>	- Defining intermediate goals<br>	- Defining or refining tasks<br>	- Planning out how to achieve the project<br>	- (Most importantly) Working on any tasks.<br><br>As Mark says, any of the tasks may be put individually on the AF list, in addition to being on the project page, if I so choose.<br><br>This approach is very general, and can be used for other task groupings besides projects.  E.g., checklists.</div>

<div class="content">I do pretty much the same thing that Mark describes in the above-referenced discussion.  How I handle any given project depends on what needs to be done for that project as well as how I'm feeling about it at any given time.  For example, my current DWM list of 42 items contains (based on a very quick scan & count) three or four items that could go under the project "dissertation".  I know there are also more than a handful of related tickler items waiting to cycle into the list when I get past a bunch of looming deadlines.  In that case, I never REALLY have just "dissertation" on my list.  But things like "sewing projects" or "house projects" definitely do either get listed as just the project name or as itemized tasks depending on how I'm feeling about them at the time/whether or not there are hard deadlines for them coming up.<br><br>(Which reminds me... I need to add to my list to get back to the contractor about the drywall work in the basement.)</div>

<div class="content">If I have a small project which needs to be done quickly, I might jot the tasks down on my DWM list in the order they occur to me, on +mo. I allow myself to do the tasks on a single day in any order when I am in "project" mode, rather than cycling through the whole list between tasks. The short break between time tomatoes has the effect of letting my inner wizard bring anything he's worried about to my attention.<br><br>This works particularly well with AF2.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>I think Mark's flexible way of determining whether I need to separate my projects into other lists or not by judging the resistance is very sensible, and I am going to try it.<br><br>Thanks guys for pointing that out, and for sharing your examples.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">I think there is also a difference between a project list and a project plan.  If you have a system like AF that constantly has items for your projects on it, you do not need another list.  If you have projects you work on occasionally you may need a project list.  If you have a big or long project, it may require its own plan outside of AF or your system.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Would a large group of tasks for the project clog up the list and prevent you from closing pages?<br><br>Do you work better with all the project's tasks on one page? If you put them in the AF list when you think of them, they'll be scattered.<br><br>Will the next action for the project get buried on an AF page in the middle of the book and be missed on your daily scan?<br><br>Every project is different, and it changes as you work through it. The state of your list also affects how you should handle projects.</div>

<div class="content">All reasons why I try to limit myself to one or two project actions in AF.  All actions go into AF when I think of them (unless I'm brainstorming on the project page), but if it's not something I'm going to work on soon, I'll merge it into the project page, and pick something I will do soon to go into AF instead.</div>

<div class="content"><<if it's not something I'm going to work on soon, I'll merge it into the project page, and pick something I will do soon to go into AF instead>><br>I do similar. I enter all tasks into my DWM list. As I get to task that appears to overlap multiple other tasks, I'll rephrase it into a project with its own task list. I have a task "Review projects" to make sure important tasks (or initial tasks, NA?) from those project task lists are in my DWM list ready for execution. <br><br>Since I do DWM on AutofocusAHK that allows me to link a task to a URL, I link such task to its project list. Hence, when I execute such task its parent project list is easily available to me.</div>
