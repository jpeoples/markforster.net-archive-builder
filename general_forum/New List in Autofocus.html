<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I continue to love autofocus - in this experiment it is by far the most productive system I have used - Thank you!<br><br>A point of clarification - when you mentioned putting all the books you might read into the system did you create a separate list for those, or add them to your full list? <br><br>Thanks!<br><br>mark</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>I added them to my full list. But do bear in mind that this was just an experiment to see what would happen if I put a whole load of intractable material into the system.</div>
