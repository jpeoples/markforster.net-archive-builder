<div class="content">The tendency to put all ones' effort into a work, until it's perfect, is perfectionism.<br>It can be valuable if it's restrained. <br><br>Imperfectionism says that flaws are acceptable. And if this definition is wrong, that's also okay. The value of Imperfectionism is that by following it, you can get a lot done quickly. This is great when you have a lot to do in little time.  Many things are better done poorly than completely undone. <br><br>So having accomplished a lot in very little time, what's to do but go back and make some things better?  Judge which need bettering, and which are okay. Improve the former and call them done. Still have time?  Reexamine done things and improve some. Leave the rest imperfect. In the end, all is done, a few done very well. In sum, a good conclusion. <br><br>It's like a History exam. Answering the first essay question exquisitely gets 10 points. Answer ten questions mediocre garners 60. Go back to improve a few and you can score 80.</div>

<div class="content">I think you are right in what you say, but on the other hand:<br><br>Some day I must write a blog article about "The Joys of Perfectionism". I think perfectionism has currently got a bad name in personal development circles, and maybe the pendulum needs to swing back a bit the other way.<br><br>For instance we are always told that goals should be believable, yet I have been experimenting lately with unachievable goals and have found them very powerful. To give a fictitious example, what if I had a goal to become a concert pianist? There's no way in which someone of my age could do that from scratch. But what if I behaved as if I could? Would I make far more progress than if my goal were to "learn to play the piano"? My experiments are suggesting that I would.<br><br>As I've occasionally mentioned on this website, I drive a Porsche. A Porsche is to all intents and purposes a perfect car. It's designed to be perfect. It works perfectly and never goes wrong. And it's a completely different driving experience, even in a town, than any of the imperfect cars which most people drive (and which I drive when I'm not driving the Porsche). And there are so many other aspects of life in which someone who is aiming for perfection raises things to a completely new level.</div>

<div class="content">"Impossible goals" and perfectionism are not the same thing at all.  <br><br>An impossible goal is one which, objectively, cannot be achieved.  Perfectionism is where you spend disproportionate resources on a trivial improvement - reprinting a document because one full stop is slightly misplaced, for example.  (That's an example - arguably - of bad perfectionism but one can certainly think of examples of good perfectionism).</div>

<div class="content">Andrew:<br><br>Well, my dictionary (Oxford Dictionary of English) defines "perfectionism" as "refusal to accept any standard short of perfection". That covers a lot more than "spending disproportionate resources on a trivial improvement".</div>

<div class="content">I tend to reserve perfectionism for certain key areas of my life, like my fiction writing (unless it's National Novel Writing Month) or music rehearsal. Yard work and house cleaning -- very much not perfection! <br><br>And I exercise perfectionism very selectively for certain work projects. My workplace tends to favor quick turnaround/iterative stuff, so I tend to want to perfect my processes for supporting quick turnarounds than for ephemeral products. The cost/value ratio doesn't support perfect products. But even then, I have to watch out that I don't lose sight of what I'm trying to perfect and why; I can easily lose myself in the abstract perfectionist process and lose sight of the ephemeral document that is actually what I'm getting paid to produce.</div>

He was given a scholarship to a music school and is being trained to be a professional opera singer.

<div class="content">Let's say I have a fair coin, and I toss it 100 times and it comes up heads every time.<br><br>What is the probability that the next coin toss will be heads?<br><br>A perfectionist will answer, 50%.  "Each coin toss is independent of the others".  Which is theoretically correct.<br><br>A non-perfectionist will say, 1%.  "I don't care what you say -- there's no way that's a fair coin!"<br><br>Maybe this story isn't perfectly suitable (!) to the question at hand.   And maybe it would be better to say "idealist" and "realist" instead of "perfectionist" and "non-perfectionist" in my example.   But in any case, I've found it very hard to overcome my overly theoretical, overly idealistic, overly perfectionistic tendencies and try to embrace a more practical,  and ultimately more realistic point of view.    Over-idealism and over-emphasis of the theoretical seem to go hand-in-hand with perfectionism.   <br><br>Here is my working theory which I struggle to reconcile in practice:<br>"In theory, theory and practice are the same.  In practice, they aren't."<br><br>On the other hand, Mark has a really valid point -- sometimes by avoiding perfectionism and end up with mediocrity or shoddiness.   <br><br>What's the most effective way to achieve the excellence and power of perfectionism that leads to the accomplishment of unattainable goals, without getting lost in the fantasy worlds of the overly-theoretical and overly-ideal?<br><br>What's the difference between foolish audacity and the courage to achieve something no one has ever achieved before?</div>

<div class="content">Aiming for the "impossible" is a good thing if taken with the attitude of an 8-year-old child playing basketball.  She can't even shoot the ball high enough to reach the basket, but that doesn't stop putting in her best effort, and enjoying the process all the time.<br><br>It's a bad thing when taken with the attitude of a pessimistic socially-prescribed perfectionist.  Such a person tries to score a basket, with no hope of success, because he believes someone else expects him to succeed despite the odds and it's just unfair, but we'll keep trying anyway!  Well actually it can also be good if the subject's self-doubt is unfounded and the pressure serves to prove it unfounded.  But if the impossibility is manifest, the pressure is trouble.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>In Halvorson's book she makes a big distinction between pursuing a goal to show how good you are and pursuing a goal in order to learn and get better. Maybe perfectionism has got a bad name because we tend to identify it with the first. But aiming for perfection in the second type of goal would be another matter entirely.</div>

<div class="content">Hi. This is my first post on the forum!<br>I felt called upon from this topic, cause I've been picked on to be a "perfectionist" many times.<br>To me what Mark intends for being a perfectionist is something different from the meaning that Alan is giving. Alan is talking about the consequences that can arise from the "refusal to accept any standard short of perfection". This habit can easely work against you if you try to do that in fields you're not fully mastering yet.<br>Perfectionsts often do this because don't handle well critiques, so they try to prevent those being always perfect.<br>Other thing is a person that already is a master, trying to keep his standards high.</div>

<div class="content">Returning to the original point: my common thinking is often to avoid working on something because I haven't time to do it well, because I'm focused on more urgent or more important items. I believe the focus is absolutely a good thing. Two things seem to be adjustable though:<br>1. Working a bit on this other thing needn't distract from my general focus, so it's okay to get started. <br>2. The item I'm focused on, sometimes doesn't need to be perfected in every respect. Maybe it doesn't need to be comprehensive, or final. By switching up, it keeps another item from languishing, and also keeps me alert to the other important things. It's easier to stop perfecting one thing, when the next thing is in mind, which may be more important.</div>

<div class="content">What Alan describes in the initial post has a name: "continuous improvement". The "little and often" approach supports this very well. The art here is to decide when to stop improving, i.e deciding whether to re-enter the topic at the end of the list or leave it at that (in AF/SF terms). Perfectionists (like myself) will tend to do much more iterations. But even there, the "standing out" of AF/SF can (could?) be helpful in distinguishing between areas where perfectionism has value and those where it's just overhead and the famous 80/20 principle is the way to go.</div>

<div class="content">Alan's "Imperfectionism" reminds me of what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls "robustness", as opposed to "over-optimization" which leads to fragility.  "Robustness" means something can survive random events, vs. over-optimization which might work very well in very constrained circumstances but breaks down quickly if the situation changes slightly or is impacted by randomness.<br><br>What's a good name for the good kind of perfectionism that Mark describes, that isn't prone to the negative connotations?</div>

<div class="content">I vote to keep the word "perfectionism" for all the negative connotations.<br><br>Maybe, as suggested earlier, "continuous improvement" or "pride in your work" for the positive side. Although the second can turn too easily into "if not perfect, then you don't take pride in your work".<br><br>The trap of inappropriate perfectionism is easy to fall into. Mark's right, though -- never aspiring to be perfect, or at least better, is just as dangerous.<br><br>I have trouble letting my kids dream, even though I know that they need to. I'm afraid of the crash. Intellectually, I know that most dreams will fade and be replaced by something that's more realistic that they will have fun achieving, but as they get older I have trouble keeping my mouth shut.<br><br>My voice teacher says adults practise much less than kids. Parents expect their kids to practise and reach milestones. Terrible things will happen (take the "why kids should learn an instrument brochure and turn it backwards") if they don't. Adults expect to enjoy learning and take the occasional exam as a fun challenge.<br><br>Seraphim, you must be an engineer at heart. We chanted that theory/practice mantra during many lab sessions.<br><br>Another side of perfectionism is "I can't do it perfectly, so I won't do it at all." Rather than quickly cleaning the traffic areas often and sometimes doing a corner or two, you do nothing until even the traffic area is an all-day chore. It becomes a vicious cycle. As has been said here, little and often, and good planning (do the traffic areas first), works.<br><br>JD: I always thought the second verse was something like:<br>But God, grant me the courage not to give up on what I think is right, even though I think it is hopeless.<br><br>Google disagrees.

<div class="content">Lorenzo, I agree. Self-worth encompasses an entire minefield. Even if they get that person's approval they'll discount it. Self-worth isn't about approval, but on the surface it feels that way. Fortunately, there are effective techniques to improve self-worth, and professionals who have well-stocked toolboxes if the self-help route doesn't work.</div>

<div class="content">It seems to me AutoFocus itself may be a perfect application of Imperfectionism: Its Achilles heel, if it has one, is a person's reluctance to dismiss and then delete stuff when there is too many things. This is the perfectionists tendency to not want to admit failure to perfectly do everything and accept that some things may be left undone. By embracing imperfection, not as an ideal but as reality, we can allow things to leave the list, thereby keeping AutoFocus in truer balance and working more perfectly as a system.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>That article describes the problems with what Martin Seligman calls 'boosterism", which is built on repetition and the Law of Attraction and other techniques that don't have a foundation. You're right -- it doesn't't work.<br><br>However, people who are prone to depression often interpret the same track record in a pessimistic manner.<br><br>Seligman's book The Optimistic Child covers the difference between boosterism and practical, earned optimism, which, as you suggest, concentrates on a track record of success.<br><br>At the extreme, pessimistic people perceive bad things are permanent, pervasive (all areas of their lives) and personal (my fault), and good things as impermanent, specific an impersonal. "We got this contract because we worked hard on this project and everyone else on the team did a great job. It probably won't happen again," vs "We got this contract, and will get more, because we are a team that works hard, and I'm a valuable member of it."<br><br>Likewise, for something bad, "We lost the contract, and will lose many more, because I screwed everything up and I bring the team down," vs "We lost this specific contract because Joe missed a paragraph in the spec and I made an important typo. We won't make those mistakes again."<br><br>It's as much how that success is interpreted as whether it exists. According to Seligman, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy helps you interpret the track record in a more positive manner. (I don't know enough about CBT to know if what he calls CBT really is, but whatever he calls it, much of his book makes sense.)</div>

<div class="content">We come to the heart of the disagreement. Neither Lorenzo nor I are arguing for chaos in anything. Our contention is not with " a room that is perfectly organized with a place for everything, or one that has stuff piled up all over the place", as we agree the latter is harder. The dispute is, "a room that is perfectly organized with a place for everything" versus, "one that has a few things out of place".<br><br>Mark appears to suggest that aiming for the perfect in all things is the best. In contradiction, I say aiming for the perfect in few things, while accepting second-best in the rest is far superior.  This is because perfect us much much harder than imperfect, and keeping a spotless room spotless is much harder than keeping a clean room cleanish. In aiming for the top of everything, you will have less time and energy to aim for the top in the most crucial things.  So emphasize the key areas more, and no when good-enough applies to the rest.  This doesn't mean accepting chaos anywhere.</div>

And in both cases Step 3 is with you all the time, outweighing the advantages/disadvantages of Step 1 a thousand times over.<br><br>In my workshops I used to give the following example:<br><br>Something goes wrong 5 times a day 7 days a week, and it takes 5 minutes to put it right.<br><br>It would take 30 minutes to sort the problem out so it never recurs.<br><br>Faced with the choice of 1) wasting 175 minutes a week for the rest of one's life, or 2) spending 30 minutes once to sort the problem out for good, what would most people choose?<br><br>Answer: 1) because it's 5 minutes work NOW versus 30 minutes work NOW.

<div class="content">I still think we're talking about different things.<br>As a poorly organized person, I bought Mark's book Do it Tomorrow, I'm interested in his methods and I'm writing here now because I'm trying to find a better way to organize. And I totally embrace what Mark said in his last posts. I'm really hungry of that energy boost coming from point 3, cause I already feeled that in many situations. But I want to feel it in every aspect of my life.<br>But that is something different from what I was thinking while writing about Perfectionism. I will clarify it.<br>I can cook. In fact I think I'm pretty good at cooking. Sometimes I cook for many people, and I enjoy to do it. With the years, I've equiped my kitchen just like I want it: not many tools, only good tools, very well organized. I know where everything is, even the small boxes buried in the higher shelf. So that's a field where I can say I'm good enought for me, and already taking advantage of that energy boost. But you know, I'm far from being perfect. Very far. I've got at least two friends of mine that are true cooks that can beat me in every single skill in the kitchen. Yes that is normal, they're professionals! Even if I'm well organized, I'm not trying to be perfect as a cook, I'm just an amateur having fun in his kitchen!<br>Misunderstanding is lying here.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br><<Wait: you get paid to produce ephemeral documents?! >><br><br>:) As a technical writer, I have to produce lots of reports and bureaucratic stuff that ticks a checkbox on someone else's list, but that is 'archived' and not referred to again. Or, it's a document that will be continually revised over the course of the fiscal year, so getting it perfect the first time isn't the point, delivering a draft on the due date is the point. ("Do you want it good or do you want it Thursday?")<br><br>I call them 'ephemeral' because ... I guess I just don't think they're built to last. If I were building a help system for an application, I'd view it differently. But even then, applications get retired and so it's ephemeral too, to me, even if it was heavily used for a few years.<br><br>Mike</div>

<div class="content"><< Just because something is ephemeral doesn't mean it can't be perfect. >><br><br>Unless permanence and significance are part of your definition of perfection.   In general terms, they are certainly part of *my* definition of perfection.   But there are exceptions, depending on the context -- e.g., the "perfect mobile phone" or the "perfect web browser".<br><br>Which gets to the heart of the problem here.   The terms "perfect" and "perfection" are being used in this discussion with widely different meanings and contexts.  It seems to me most of the disagreement is about those meanings -- and the particular meaning one has in mind determines whether one thinks pursuing perfection is worthwhile or not.</div>

<div class="content">Pathological perfectionists can't even get started until the systems are sorted out and set up.   Which means they often just can't get started, period.    (I know from personal experience unfortunately, how painful and ineffective this can be.)<br>	<br>"Aim for perfection" -->   I.e., don't expect to START with perfection, and don't let the lack of perfection prevent you from moving forward.   Don't spend all your time perfecting your systems before moving forward.   Start with what you have, get moving, iterate, drop what doesn't work, but once you have momentum with something and are getting things done, start looking to improve your systems to support the work.   (I also know from personal experience, how effective and liberating this can be, and what great results can come from it.)</div>

<div class="content">Here's an example of how one's own ideas of perfection can change over time.<br><br>I used to write detailed emails - with executive summaries - pretty frequently.   To me, this was "perfect" -- I provided all the details someone might need, with a summary for people who might not have time.   Problem:  It took too long to write.   I'm a fast writer and fast organizer of words, but even so a 2-page email detailing a complex problem might take 30 minutes to write.<br>	<br>Then I came across the 5-sentence rule.   And I tried it.  <a href="http://five.sentenc.es/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://five.sentenc.es/</a><br>	<br>I find I get more response, and more discussion, more quickly, and if people need more details, they ask for them.   Or we have a phone call or meeting.<br>	<br>The 5-sentence email turns out to be a ***lot*** closer to perfection than my 2-page detailed emails with executive summaries.    (Assuming the goal has always been clear timely communication that results in appropriate and timely decisions and actions.)<br><br>It also turns out that the 5-sentence rule is a lot more ***robust*** -- in line with Alan's idea of "imperfection".    It's a lot easier to FINISH a 5-sentence email and get it sent out in a timely manner.  It's a lot harder to break the process when the process is so lightweight.<br><br>Which makes me think...   Maybe Alan's idea of "imperfection" is very close, in reality, if not semantics, to Mark's idea of "perfection".</div>

But I also limit myself consciously to less variety: since I know I don't want to put too much time and effort in this, I stick with fewer things, aiming to do them very nicely.<br><br><<Pathological perfectionists can't even get started until the systems are sorted out and set up.
