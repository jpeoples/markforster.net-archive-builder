<div class="content">I have been working on a batch of 100  items with AF4R and SF. <br>Finaly I needed to reduce it a bit these item and focus about some of them.<br><br>Your regularly read my topics and know that i love testing things. <br><br>So I decided to go back to AF1 just for a try. I wished feeling things more than doing even if this experiments could lead me to proscratrination. Some time the better thing to do is doing nothing at all isn't it ? <br><br>So I reported all my stuff, reduced  to 70 items and let me lead by the system. <br><br>There is a stange aspect about AF1. It is the adiction of the system. It's incredible how you fell productive using it.  More intuition is indeed increased and you really feel focus and concentrate on the flow of information. <br><br>But as i was using the system I felt the real need to focus on my urgent and unfinished tasks. So I naturaly created an UNFINISHED page and tooks 3 of them i reported on my desk block as a simple word. I also could create an URGENT page but did not for the present time. <br><br>I just wonder if some of you experimented the same thing ? <br>Is you intuition increased by AF1 ? <br>Did you go back to AF1 after trying others system ? <br>How do you do with unfinished task ? are they on a special page ? <br>How do you manage your day and especially urgent things to do them first ?</div>

<div class="content">Yes to all of it Jupiter. I went back to SAF, and it is the AF1 aspects that you mention that I really enjoy.<br><br>I don't separate unfinished tasks per se but I do work the second column very hard, unfinished tasks tend to go there and get done <br><br>I don't do anything special to manage my day. My job is stressful, many things are urgent, but I let my intuition guide me as to which tasks to do first.</div>

<div class="content">I usually have several lists going. Goals, targets, reminders, weekly, Daily Focus. It varies with how far behind I am and how much I need to focus on a smaller set. I'll often pull out a day's worth for a Daily Focus list.<br><br>I treat each DF list as an AF1 page. I also treat each weekly and monthly goal list as an AF1 page. The incentive to close a page is often the only reason I do some tasks. (Not that the tasks are unimportant, just they're not quite important enough to actually do right now, like cleaning the toaster. It can always wait another day, but every time I look at it I think, "Yuck".)</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter: give AF2 a try if you are in the mood for testing things out. You might be surprised how well it deals with the urgent stuff at the end of the list, whilst pulling you towards the block dismissal points at the beginning. And dismissal is automatically applied everyday, thus forcing you to think about those niggling tasks that simply won't stand out.<br><br>This might put those things in the middle at a bit of a risk of being neglected, but as soon as that realisation hits, you tend to pay attention to them after the urgent stuff is handled.</div>
