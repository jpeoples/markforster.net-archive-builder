<div class="content">I have continued to use this process every day and I reallly, really like it. In fact, I've tried to go back to the usual process of starting on the page you left off with and I can't. For the first time since I started using AF I have a completely empty email inbox. My email was really causing me anxiety because in using the original approach I wasn't doing any email-related tasks for 3 or more days. Starting with the last page allows me to stay on top of some daily tasks that aren't yet routine for me. For example, I don't have "do chores" on my AF list. I do those at the same time every day. But I do have "wash whites" on the list because I don't have a set time for laundry. I can keep up with these tasks much better this way and haven't yet found a serious drawback unless it's that I'm doing fewer old tasks. I am quite comfortable with that tradeoff, however. Just to be clear, after working the last page, I return to the page I left off with the day before as per AF instructions.</div>

<div class="content">I'm at a loss to imagine why your method would have a problem if it is working for you.  I know that I review all of my pages every morning and that is not in the instructions either ... but it works for me.</div>
