<div class="content">This bears some resemblance to the "I'm not really going to write that report now, but I'll just get the file out" technique.<br><br>I also used to advise people who wanted to go for a morning run every day not to make goals like "I'm going to run three miles every day before work", but instead "I'm going to step out of my front door every day before work wearing my running gear".</div>
