<div class="content">Hi all. I'm a frequent reader but a rare poster on this site. Usually I pop in to enter the Lenten Challenge and then pop back in at a later date to announce I flopped lol. This year I'm determined to stick to a system for the entire challenge.<br><br>So, I thought I'd create a log of my experience with Another Simple and Effective Method (ASEM). This system appealed to me because it's both flexible and restrictive. There comes a point where you're left with one task you've been resisting, and it's like...don't think about, just do it!<br><br>My list is pretty basic...chores, routines, project tasks. Personal and work items are both there. Everything is done with pen and paper.<br><br>To keep myself accountable, I'll update this post every Friday morning.<br><br>02/19/21<br>Pg. 1: 19/25<br>Pg. 2: 21/25<br>Pg. 3: 12/25<br>Pg. 4: 1/15<br><br>53/90 tasks done</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, Mark!<br><br>02/26/21<br>Pg. 1: 25/25<br>Pg. 2: 25/25<br>Pg. 3: 25/25<br>Pg. 4: 23/25<br>Pg. 5: 21/25<br>Pg. 6: 21/25 (1 task dismissed)<br>Pg. 7: 15/25<br>Pg. 8: 8/18 (1 task dismissed)<br><br>163/193 tasks done, 2 tasks dismissed.<br><br>I'm a little surprised by the numbers, as this week didn't feel very productive. Looking over the list, however, I did catch up with a lot of work tasks I'd been dragging my feet on.<br><br>Seeing that there's only 30 tasks makes me want to close the gap now.</div>
