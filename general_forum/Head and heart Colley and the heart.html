<div class="content">Ok so some some variation of Colley seems to be a useful heuristic for a good-enough and quick rational decisions. Final Version may therefore be like "find the benchmark resistance by scanning the list and keep applying Colley".<br><br>How might it compare to the even simpler non-rational decision?<br><br>In <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/8/14/listen-to-your-heart.html#references" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/8/14/listen-to-your-heart.html#references</a><br><br>"What is my heart saying?” is very versatile. Its usefulness isn’t just confined to finding out what you really feel about a situation. You can also use it for making decisions, for checking out impulses or sudden impressions, or simply for getting directions as to what to do next.<br><br>“What could I do wholeheartedly right now?” is the heart-equivalent of Colley?<br><br>As Alan says "I now say I won't do them as set out". i think the insight here is the "as set out". Tasks may often need re-phrasing or chunking-down before they can be committed to whole heartedly. That may be a way of reducing resistance, ie increasing engagement and ease and flow. Perhaps "how can this task be changed to become whole-hearted?" Perhaps "readiness" is when a task has enough heart?</div>

<div class="content">Ummm responding to my own post...<br><br>In <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1075458#post1076737" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1075458#post1076737</a> Mark says "if you do try asking questions like [What stirs your heart? ] on a consistent basis you will find that your mind gradually starts to resist the implications of the question."<br><br>I agree with that. Our "reactive self" monitors perceived threats and dangers and communicates to us via emotions and body sensations. And I think that's why tasks have to be re-expressed to feel safer, secure and more fun. Re-interpreted or re-defined. If not, then we start to generate reasons to stay in the familiar. If an action is not appealing we can't be whole-hearted. But the unappealingness may come from how we've defined the task or situation, or what we believe or have assumed around it.</div>

<div class="content">So far no one has got even remotely close to guessing what the Final Version consists of!</div>

<div class="content">I'd be surprised if anyone did guess.  We're all working from your published systems as guidelines for new ideas, where you're working from the principles that lead you to design your systems.  This means anything we come up with will be merely derivative, while yours will be innovative.  Meanwhile if we tried to work from principles, they'd be our own principles and we'd innovate something different than what you dreamt up.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, any plans to 'stress test' FV with a few selected people before finalising your book?</div>

<div class="content">smiley:<br><br>Maybe Mark could auction off a few beta-testing opportunities on eBay.  He could probably get enough money from that to fully fund the first printing of the book!  :-)</div>
