<div class="content"><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1693383#post1694583" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1693383#post1694583</a><br>I've been following this approach for a couple weeks and it's worked swell.  But I noticed a peculiar thing.  I never cycled around, and it was never a problem.  Which means, the system effectively reduces itself to this:<br><br><<Go through the list, starting at page 1. Delete or file or do any tasks. Rewrite any unfinished at the end.  When you reach the end, repeat the last two pages until the day ends>><br><br>That's it!  If anything needed doing today, I saw it and did it.  Or it just came up again I reentered it on the last page and did it then.  The one additional factor is that pages over a week old are aggressively pruned.  This keeps the list short so I get to the end easily enough.</div>

<div class="content">I've been away from the forum for many months, but have dipped in every now again so what's been cooking.<br><br>I have to admit I've been erring and straying from my GED/AF/DWM/SF paths, no particular reason, no border collies to round me up and bring me home.  Thus I am a bit confused as to which approach most people are using these days, or are they all waiting for Mark's Final Version?<br><br>As of old, Alan's post is useful and I may adapt it for my present modus operandi: recording most stuff in my Moleskine +/- A5 size ('medium') notebook.  It's good 'just to read the list'!<br><br>I am combining this with entering into my smartphone the tasks from the list which have not been tackled yet, but wish to be reminded about and track when away from my list.<br><br>I am not dexterous enough to capture everything into my smartphone yet, which i think reflects my being always torn between paper and electronic.over the years.  I still find the former worthwhile, yet also hanker after having a lot of the tasks on the smartphone so it can nag me.<br><br>BTW, I am using Ultimate To-Do List on my Android Galaxy S2 smartphone which synchronises with Toodledo on my Toshiba notebook computer.<br><br>Once I've been convinced that handwritten notes can be accommodated nicely on a portable device, I may try to record everything on it.  If I had not bought my S2 in May last year, I might have been thinking now about the Galaxy Note which seems to be gaining increasing approval ratings despite its large size, 5.5 inches or so.</div>

<div class="content">Reviving AF1 is the latest fashion. See the threads on Improving AF1.  One goal is to get SF advantages without the complexity.  You also will find DWM variants remain popular.<br><br>Capture suggestion: get a notecard and a pen. Use that on the go to record stuff, and reenter at leisure on your android.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Alan, will have a look while waiting at airports on Friday and Saturday.<br><br>I did not mention, but I also have a pocket-size Moleskine which I can use to record when out and about, this notebook contains local contact info etc which I have to note when arriving at foreign assignment locations (currently Uganda, described by Churchill as "The Jewel of Africa", he was right).  <br><br>For most of the time at a desk or for meeting notes, I prefer the 'A5' size Moleskine.</div>
