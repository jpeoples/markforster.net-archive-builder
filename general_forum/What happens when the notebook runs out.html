<div class="content">I realize no one has gotten to this point yet, but I was wondering if anyone had given it some thought:<br><br>What happens in DWM when you get to the last month/last ~30 pages in your planner?  <br><br>The easy solution is to use a loose-leaf notebook/planner, but if you're not, it seems that you might have to carry two books with you, or find some way of transferring pages from the old to the new.</div>

<div class="content">The Moleskine cahier I'm using only has enough pages to mid-Mar (I think), and then I'm going to flip the book over and use the bottom half of the pages - that'll get me to end of April-ish before I really run out of notebook :) I'll probably just use a tiny binder clip to attach this one to a new cahier notebook. I haven't thought about it too much though.</div>

<div class="content">I ran out of room / my notebook finally fell apart (I'd been using the same one since AF1 and it was almost entirely dependent on lots of duck tape to stay together) about 10 days into DWM.  Here's what I did:<br><br>Copied over all active tasks into the new notebook.  For lists that were already closed (i.e., "today" through day 6) I put multiple days per page, with a line to show where days ended.  For days 7 through 29 (where they were still open) I gave each day 1 side of a sheet of paper.  For days 30 and on, I gave each day both sides of a sheet of paper.  <br><br>I don't know what I'll do when I have to transition to the NEXT notebook (this one only has 80 sheets, so it won't be all *that* long).  They're pretty small (I bought a bunch on clearance) so maybe I'll just carry two for a while.</div>

<div class="content">I suppose this is where the 'loose leaf' sort are useful.  I have gone back to my filofax and of course you just keep adding on the end, and removing old pages from the front to keep it at a reasonable thickness.<br><br>Electronic would also cope well with this - however I spend so long on the computer, I need something that is not electronic for a change. I find my iPhone and PDAs just too small to use regularly and I don't want to have my laptop with me all the time.</div>

<div class="content">I have the page-a-day in a three ring binder and it's fab. I am printing my own calendar pages now (started with Franklin Covey two-page-per-day, but saving money, so printing my own!) I use a 1/2 inch binder and keep thru the following month. So I have Feb and all of March in there now. Will add all of April at the end of February.</div>

<div class="content">Allison - what do you use to print out your pages?  Do you print double sided?  Just wondered what software you have and how you generate dates and so on.</div>
