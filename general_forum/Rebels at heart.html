<div class="content">Christine has mentioned several times that AF has revealed to her that she "doesn't like being told what to do, even by myself  :-)", and one of the great things about AF is that nobody is telling you what to do.<br><br>And then Christine goes on to say that she must just be a rebel at heart.<br><br>I was pondering on this.  I also don't do well in situations where I am being micromanaged, where everything is pre-planned and pre-structured.  The very thought of it makes me want to run away.  It is constraining, suffocating.  <br><br>But at the same time, I don't feel like an incorrigible capricious stubborn rebel.  I am quite happy to give up my own ideas if someone else presents me with a better one.  I am quite happy to go along with the program, if the reasons for doing so are compelling.<br><br>But I chafe at over-structured systems and micromanagement, because they are so *ineffective*.  They don't let me do what needs to be done.  They just get in the way most of the time.  <br><br>At the very least, strictly enforced structure doesn't give me the opportunity to even consider whether there might be a more effective way to do things -- it leaves me feeling that I don't really know if I am doing what is most important, maybe I should be doing something else.  <br><br>It's the same old problem as procrastination.  I don't know what to do, I don't know if I am really working on the right things, or working as effectively as I could be.  I feel anxious about everything and don't know where to start, leading to reluctance and resistance, but also to flitting around and doing nothing useful.  And if the artificial rules of some "system" are what's causing this, then yes, it leads to rebellion against that system.<br><br>But I don't think it means one necessarily has a rebellious nature.  I think it means you have a strong desire to be the best you can be, and don't tolerate artificial and arbitrary constraints that prevent you from doing that.<br><br>Autofocus alleviates this problem better than any system I've ever seen.  It works as an extremely effective optimization mechanism.  It automatically and systematically draws you to the most important tasks that have the best ROI (however you want to define ROI).  It circumvents the procrastination and rebellion at its source, by persistently and frequently presenting you with the opportunity to evaluate what is most important and take action on it.</div>

I would never have the ability to describe things as you did.. Allow me to add another comment of yours<br> <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/638216" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/638216</a> .<br><br>I commemorated a month of AF.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br><br>Your comments above are really interesting and do tie in very closely to my own experiences.  Although I said I must just be a rebel at heart I don't really feel like a rebel as such but do have that immense frustration with being micromanaged, with ineffective systems and systems that just plain "don't make sense".  <br><br>I really relate to your comments - you have put that struggle into words really clearly and I also really relate to your insight into the procrastination aspect.<br> <br>I have suffered immense frustration with rigid systems that did achieve their goal.  One of the advantages of becoming a consultant was that I had the opportunity to question the workings of systems and a large part of my work involved streamlining those systems.  What was interesting though in looking back was the lengths to which some people would go to justify a system, lengths which, if they had stepped back and looked objectively at their justifications would have left them open mouthed in astonishment at the ridiculous things they came up with.  What was sad was that, in many cases, people around could already see what was going on and had frequently lost respect in the "person of influence"; although they had the ability to change things, by their intransigence they were just left looking vaguely silly.<br><br>I think you have hit the nail on the head when you say "strictly enforced structure doesn't give me the opportunity to even consider whether there might be a more effective way to do things"  I firmly believe that all systems need to be constantly reviewed, not to a time detrimental effect, but because things are constantly changing - just because a system works perfectly now doesn't mean that a better way won't present itself in the future.  The speed of increase in technology for one means that new tools may be available.  Handwriting a bank ledger in copperplate writing was a perfect system  - at the time.  Imagine the queues if that was the practice today!  A system for review is always essential but it must be remembered that a review may well conclude that what is in place IS best practice at this point in time.  There is certainly no benefit in change for change's sake.  The NHS is probably a prime example of that sort of philosophy!<br><br>What AF has done for me is to make me realise that my procrastination is a sympton not a disease - I am not an incurable procrastinor aka useless or whatever.  I procrastinate for a reason - I had just not recognised the reason - or even necessarily looked for one - it was just one of those accepted facts of life.<br><br>In a way procrastination is a bit like an allergy.  If I am constantly sneezing I may just think I am ill; if it continues I think it is a permanent unalterable condition.  If it eases when I go away for a while it must just be that I "needed a break".  It is not until something outside of my normal routine existence identifies that actually the problem is a cat that I realise I don't need to live like that! <br></div>

<div class="content">There's a nice book called "Too Perfect", by Allan Mallinger and Jeannette DeWyze (he's the psychologist/psychiatrist, she's the writer) about perfectionism and its connection to the need for control. Mallinger devotes a chapter to the phenomena he calls "demand sensitivity" and "demand resistance", and really puts his finger on something, I think. I definitely suffer from demand resistance in a variety of contexts, and I think Autofocus does a really nice job of circumventing that.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the info Martin - something else to add to my reading list!<br><br>I just looked it up on Amazon, and apart from being somewhat bemused by the fact that the price varies from £5.64 to £110.59 (!) I was also amused by the fact that another book shown up by the search was called "Teach Your Horse Perfect Manners: How You Should Behave So Your Horse Does Too"  Made me wonder if there aren't some lessons to be learned that could answer the questions raised re using AF in a Team scenario.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>I was amused by the idea of behaving as an example to one's horse! But it did bring up one thing in the team context, and that is the behaviour of the "team" who are commenting on AF on this forum. During the whole of the Beta testing, I've only deleted one comment (apart from obvious spam) and that was because I considered the writer was making an unnecessarily personal remark about another poster.<br><br>I was reminded that when I first started out writing a blog I was told by someone "The tone of the comments will reflect the tone of your blog". There are innumerable blogs where one can see this in effect, both positively and negatively. But I take it as a great compliment that all the posters on this blog are thoughtful and well-mannered. <br><br>Perhaps that tells us something very important about team dynamics.</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I for one have really enjoyed reading the various comments and insights from people and have gained an immense amount from the experience.  I have mentioned before that I have not participated in a forum like this before but the few I have visited, usually on the occasion of my PC behaving irrationally, have been quite shocking by the way in which people respond to eachother.<br><br>I also think a team will reflect back the attitude of the leader so the ultimate credit goes to you Mark for setting the example .......</div>

<div class="content">I say almost the same: I also think a team will reflect back the attitude of the leader so the ultimate credit goes to you Mark for setting the tone ....... ( I am not sure if this expression has the same meaning in English - the one who set the tone in a orchestra)</div>

<div class="content">Wanted to mention that the previously mentioned book 'too perfect' is an okay book. I had bought the book a year or so ago after reading a similar comment. I'm not an extreme perfectionist or control freak so I didn't feel gravitated to read the whole book. But the chapter that covers demand sensitivity and demand resistance was worth it. <br><br>Demand-resistance is defined as: "a chronic and automatic negative inner response to the perception of pressure, expectations, or demands(from within or without"<br><br>The authors 'remedy' is to become aware of it in the moment, especially whenever you say/think/feel 'I should, or I ought' and to ask yourself: 'what do you want?'.<br><br>I too find this an unusual forum and I like it!<br> <br></div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, Mark linked to my blog article on obligation-based procrastination that you can find here:<br><a href="http://wonderwomen.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/10/freedom-from-procrastination.html" rel="nofollow">http://wonderwomen.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/10/freedom-from-procrastination.html</a><br><br>I think it speaks to the issue you're presenting. Even though I wrote the article, I still needed help resolving obligation-based procrastination with respect to my kids. Thanks for your comments, btw! I don't know why we resist obligation, but we most certainly do! <br><br>This IS a really wonderful group. Maybe we're all in a good mood now that we're getting things done. LOL</div>

<div class="content">Just to add to Peter's post: what's especially likely to cause trouble is the double whammy of demand resistance combined with demand sensitivity, which, roughly speaking, is the tendency to see demands in many more places than they can really be found – in the hopes or mere preferences of others, for example, or in one's own desires. (So for someone with demand sensitivity, wanting something tends to mysteriously transubstantiate into feeling that one has to do it.) Seeing demands everywhere and then automatically rebelling against them is obviously not a good way to go.<br><br>And yes, Mallinger doesn't have much to say about what to do about these afflictions except to become aware of them (on a watchful, ongoing basis) and to try to stop and ask oneself what one really wants to do, as Peter says. But then, as Mallinger points out, any set of rules for dealing with demand resistance is likely not to be very effective....<br><br></div>
