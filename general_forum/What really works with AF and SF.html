<div class="content">It makes quiet a long time that I work with AF and SF. <br><br>I guess It is time to make a real point about it and what happened in my life or yours because of the system. <br><br>- First the real improvement happened when I decided to do it on paper, ONLY ! and decided to make it simple. I simply took a paper spiral note book and wrote everything one after the other each new day starting by the date. <br><br>When I mean everything I might say "actionable" i.e. tasks, Thought and ideas and notes goes to another notebook. All others informations goes to my diary, my paper folders, others note books....<br><br>Then I noticed 2 kind of situation. <br>The day was quiet I worked in AF way. <br>The day was hot I worked in SF way <br><br>Then I noticed that I the end of the day there was a kind of daily review which purpose was to eliminate the maximum of information from the list. <br><br>Still I worked like this I can tell you that I feel very comfortable. <br>The system goes fast, intuitively with a great elimination of the items. <br><br>I dont do any daily list, I don't take time to make others list. <br>I work day by day.<br>If something still stay in the previous day it is that is is dismissed or it doesn't worth to satay on the list. <br><br>Except this, I only work on some projects when I have time too. <br>I have an unfinished project list and future project list. <br><br>I am very happy which my list. The system is great.</div>
