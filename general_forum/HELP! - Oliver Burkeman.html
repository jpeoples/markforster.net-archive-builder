<div class="content">This book was in the daily deals for the kindle, so I picked up a copy. It's a critical look at self help and productivity literature. <br><br>Mark's work (timed bursts and Autofocus) and GTD are mentioned a few times in this book in a fairly positive way, although I didn't rate the book much. Still, hopefully it might encourage a few people to check out this website.</div>

<div class="content">Yes I got this as well - for 99p you can't grumble and it's an interesting read. The author has reviewed many systems and self help ideas and offers his views.  His view on todo or task lists is to have two only, one long master one on which everything sits, and a short day one where you choose 3-4 tasks to do today, then when they are complete, you choose one or two others and repeat.<br><br>And of course he does reference Mark Forster 'time management expert'...</div>
