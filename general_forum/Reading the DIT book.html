<div class="content">Just got home from work and found my copy of "Do It Tomorrow" in my mail. <br><br>Is there anything special I should pay attention to while reading the book? <br>What would be the best way to read this book, chapter by chapter or at one fell swoop? Are some chapters more important than others?<br><br>Rainer<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Rainer,<br>You will find a Quick Start Guide at the beginning of the book. I suggest you implement that immediately and then read the book in one go to get on overview of the contents. Then go back through it chapter by chapter doing the exercises and refining the methods.<br>Mark</div>
