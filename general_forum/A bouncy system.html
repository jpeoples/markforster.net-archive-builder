<div class="content">The Rules:<br><br>1. You have one list of everything you plan to do sometime soon.  Pages don't matter and in electronic implementations are not needed.<br><br>2. You start at the beginning of each day by scanning from the last task on the list, moving upwards, and doing whatever stands out.<br><br>3. Whenever you complete a task, the direction of scanning changes.  If you were moving upward, after selecting and doing a task, you start moving downward.  If you were moving downward, after selecting and doing a task, you start moving upward.<br><br>4. When you reach the bottom of the list, you bounce off of it and proceed upward from the bottom.<br><br>5. When you reach the top task on the list, you must do it now.</div>

<div class="content">The Theory:<br><br>Tasks you are resisting more tend to concentrate at the top, and tasks you are resisting less tend to concentrate at the bottom.  When you complete a hard task, you are rewarded with the chance to go down and get to something easier or more urgent.  When you complete an easy task, you are pushed upward toward the danger zone.<br><br>If you are really resisting the top task, you will do just about anything to avoid it - even select one of the harder tasks on the way so that you can head back down, away from the task you are dreading.  Eventually you are forced to get that dreaded top task out of the way.</div>

<div class="content">The Shortcut:<br><br>On a daily basis, you post three high value tasks you will get done by the end of the day. If you fail to tackle all three, you donate $1000 to Mark ;)</div>

<div class="content">Somewhere on this website I described exactly Austin's bouncy system, with the one exception that I bounced off the top of the list as well as the bottom. I also tried it without bounces - i.e. if you got to the end of the list you just carried on from the beginning and vice versa.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe I subconsciously remembered it, then.  I think the required top task will make a huge difference.  However, I'm not going to try it until I've thoroughly tested the other system I've described recently.  It just hit me (again, perhaps through subconscious remembrance) and I couldn't resist posting it.  It could be very useful, or it could be very annoying, or both.  Before too long I'll try it.</div>

<div class="content">Two reasons *not* to try this variation: (1) it adds complexity by having to remember which direction you're going; and (2) you may never get to the top of the list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>LOL!  I wouldn't frame it as number of tasks, I'd frame it as total TIME AND EFFORT toward one or more MITs. If people want to get cagey, they could list 3 relatively easy tasks that could be completed in less than one hour.  I do this to myself without the money component when I feel lousy or my attitude stinks.  If I find that I'm sitting on an important yet large project that would benefit greatly from starting early, I'll set up the task with a time component to meet or exceed. That way, I have plenty of time to get familiar with the job and it stays fresh on my mind. It also gives me time to try a different angle if my ideas and/or predictions fall flat.  LOL! If I'm on the clock, I KNOW that I'm giving 100% effort toward my work. That's why I restrict my MITs to only 2-4 hours a day. That leaves lots of time to do easier stuff to serve as a buffer between the difficult sessions or time to diffuse my brain when I hit a fail yet I don't yet have an idea how to approach it another way.  While I'm doing other things, my mind is ruminating in the background to find another approach.  I still count the time and effort even if I fail.  I figure that it's a necessary part of the learning curve or discovery process and I genuinely put in the time and effort to give it my best try.<br><br>Your idea of giving money works great.  For me, it's less an issue of losing the money than feeling ashamed that I didn't do what I set out to do.  Once a money bet is declared in your own mind even without witnesses, the possible shame factor kicks in and gets me moving.  LOL!  I get so afraid of shaming myself in my own head that I'll usually try to finish it even faster so that I don't have to dread starting each day with the fear that I might let myself down.<br><br>I don't have a dog right now to do the bet of putting $100 in a poop bag but I do have a shredder.  Giving a losing bet over doesn't scare me 1/2 as bad as destroying currency.  LOL!<br>Thanks for that great idea.</div>

<div class="content"><<Two reasons *not* to try this variation: (1) it adds complexity by having to remember which direction you're going; and (2) you may never get to the top of the list.>><br><br>(1) can be solved by drawing an arrow after the selected task, if you really need it.  (2) is impossible.</div>

<div class="content">Well I probably shouldn't make emphatic statements about a system I haven't even tried yet, but I don't think it's 'impossible' to fail to reach the top of the list, with the rules as stated. If I end each day near the bottom of the list, and continually add more tasks each day, I could imagine always bouncing back down before reaching the very top.<br><br>Am I missing something here?  It's not a closed list, is it?</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, ubi, I was imprecise, not you.  It is technically possible, but if one is seriously working the system and doesn't have an inappropriately long list, I would regard it as unfeasible.</div>
