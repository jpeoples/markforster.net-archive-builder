<div class="content">I have searched literally for years for the "Best" application<br>to use for time management, GTD and now AfxDwm.  I have<br>tried just about everything and have come across some<br>very good and well featured programs.<br><br>But every application, no matter how well it seemed to work,<br>left me with a feeling of constriction and claustrophobia.<br><br>I yearned to breathe free, to break out of the golden cage.<br><br> I have come to the conclusion, digitally, the best solution may be to<br> use no application at all. Just use the file system.<br><br>Which means, for example, using folder titles for AF entries<br>Then one can use any and all applications or no applications<br>for your system achieving maximum flexibility.<br><br>I arrived at this conclusion after cleaning up my computer<br>desktop according to the excellent advice found in this<br>article.<br><br><a href="http://www.lifeclever.com/how-to-organize-your-cluttered-desktop-and-regain-your-sanity/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifeclever.com/how-to-organize-your-cluttered-desktop-and-regain-your-sanity/</a><br><br>I thought If you can follow their system based on GTD why not use it for autofocus.<br><br>Probably not an original idea but there it is.<br><br>One very useful feature of this approach is that not only<br>can each folder contain files and data connected with the<br>action but actions can be linked with any files folders, other actions or <br>locations on your hard drive through the use of the aliasing <br>function.<br><br>Can such a system be exported?  Yes.  One possiblity is<br>zipping it which should preserve the folder structure at<br>least to a few levels but perhaps not the aliases.<br><br><br><br>JR</div>

<div class="content">I'm interested in systems that take advantage of the file system.  But in the case of AutoFocus, order is important and it changes frequently.  I don't know how well you can get that happening with files.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>Order within date may not be so important, so presumably if each date is used to name a folder, these will be in sequence (if named e.g. YYMMDD), and other folders/files can be moved to the folder representing a week from now.</div>
