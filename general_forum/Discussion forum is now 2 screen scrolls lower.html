<div class="content">Hi,<br>I've noticed in recent weeks that to reach the Autofocus discussion info, you have to scroll down several times (through a cental blank white area) to get to the info. Is there any chance this could be positioned higher up within what is currently white space. Having to page down twice to see every different post is no fun!!<br><br>Sorry if this is not very comprehensible, and I hope it's not because I have a tiny screen!!<br><br>I hope someone with more tech-know-how will be able to understand what I'm trying to say.<br><br>Thanks<br>Carol</div>

<div class="content">I noticed that too, about a week ago. Tthe odd thing (to me) is that on the PC with Windows Vista (and IE 7 I think) , it's still fine. On the PC with Windows XP (and IE 6), the forum posts are way down like you said. No idea if it's an IE or Windows or something else problem.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>I'm using XP:IE7 and I don't note any difference.  I wouldn't discount it being a Windows effect because I find that I always have to tweek my pc whenever they decide to download supposed improvements!  grrrrrrrrr<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I'm using Windows Vista and IE7 and have not been having a problem. Have just checked on my old XP PC running IE7 and it is fine also so it could be an IE6 issue (probably triggered by one of Microsoft's updates!)</div>

<div class="content">On Vista/IE7 with wide screen its fine, on older (work) laptop with XP /  IE6 I had the same problem - I put it down to it being a smaller screen (but I'm no techie so could be wrong)</div>

<div class="content">In my opinion it's rather IE6 than a small screen fault :)</div>

<div class="content">It does sound like IE6.  Just a word of warning - if anyone is tempted to try the IE8 Beta Don't!!!  If you do and then try to uninstall it you can't go back.  I ended up with a screen showing just the wallpaper - no icons, no task bar, no start button, no nuffink!  The only option was to reinstall IE8 but suffice it to say doing that with nothing on the screen except a picture of a flower was a challenge!  You have been warned..... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Looks fine w/XP and Firefox. Also, on my Linux netbook w/Firefox again, it is fine. Rarely use IE anymore.</div>

<div class="content">I echo Christine B's comment, IE8 beta was a huge problem to remove, though I did find instructions somewhere on the web on how to do so. (Although I use Firefox as a rule, I like to review developments with IE, but this beta stopped Napster from working so it was a problem.)<br><br>This is a good time for me to appeal for the layout of this page to be adjusted. When reading the forum on a PDA, I have to scroll past all the links on the left hand column first. Then for some reason the right-hand column, and then the posts come into view. I have no idea why it happens in that order but if there were a tweak which made the posts come first on a Windows Mobile PDA it would improve the experience.</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>Coincidentally, and probably unrelated to the above, the Discussion Forum pages are becoming increasingly unpredictable in load time, and the Twitter Grade button does not always load.  Is it that SquareSpace are doing some site adjustment or could it be that the Twitter Button is somehow impacting the page?  This has been over the last two days only.<br><br>Just something else for you to look at (i.e. add to your list) <br>.......... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone for drawing my attention to these problems. However the pages look fine to me, and load fast. Even the Twitter Grade badge loads immediately.<br><br>I normally use Firefox, but I've tried it out on Safari and Google Chrome and it still works fine. I even opened IE7 (something I'm normally very reluctant to do) and it loaded the Forum with no fuss whatsoever (must be the only page it does!)<br><br>I should also mention that I keep my computer fully updated with the latest Windows updates (XP).<br><br>The only thing I can do is draw the attention of the Squarespace staff to this discussion. I'll let you know what reply I get.</div>

<div class="content">Am I right in thinking that the only browser that anyone is experiencing these problems with is IE6?<br><br>Could anyone who is having these problems with any other Browser please say. Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark - <br><br>Have been out all day and this site is loading fine now - suspect this is just "my" problem (no rude comments please!)</div>

<div class="content">Must be an IE6 problem. It shows up on my win2k computer at the office and the xp computer at home.  No problem with Firefox on both computers.<br></div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>You can switch off automatic updates  ... and I have.  It is disconcerting to have your computer stop working when you really need it.  I have it download the updates but allow me to choose if and when to apply them.  I only do so when I can afford a sleigh ride ;-)<br><br>As to browser, don't even install IE7, if you can avoid it.  There are uninstall issues around that one as well.  I forget what they are as I had already installed it so just gave up on the idea of doing whatever I had planned.<br><br>Echo the IE8 problem ... just say no ;-)<br><br>I use FireFox with no trouble.  They update it frequently and the plugins I use are updated even more frequently.  The only delay is a notice giving me the choice to install them before FireFox comes up and then it takes about one minute longer, less usually.  Easy peasy.<br><br>As to the look of the site ... looks fine to me.  I was put off by the scrolling at first.  My druthers would be to have the latest posts first, but then I realized I could hit the "end" key and start from the bottom, which is the same then.  Then the "home" key to get me to the top so I could go back to the home page.</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>A big THANK YOU for the "End" key tip - didn't know that!  Fantastic!<br><br>The IE7 problem was the same as the IE8 and occurred with the IE7 Beta if you wanted to go back to IE6.  The fact is that any IE installation seems to do weird and wonderful Microsofty things to miscellaneous .dlll files and all of the usual tricks to correct it just don't work - including Microsoft's own rollback options! Cheers Microsoft!</div>

<div class="content">LOL ;-)  "And the Lord said: Let there be mice.  And he saw that it was good."  ROTF ;-)<br><br>One other nasty just got me a few days ago ... I was installing SP3 to my XP machine and once that was done (no small job, I can tell you) I got waves and waves of updates for it.  One of those installed something called Microsoft Desktop Search.  Of course, Google has a much better one, which you don't have to lose space on the lower tool bar to use .. you just hit CTL twice.  In any case, when I realized it was taking about 20% of the CPU and eating up valuable disk space, I tried to uninstall it.  Yeah, right.  I got a message that most of my previous patches would stop working if I dared uninstall their beautifully useless desktop search.  Now I'm hunting for a way to disable it so I can live with it without losing my resources.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Haven't come across Microsoft Desktop Search - (which sounds like a good thing!) It's all very well when MS give you the option to choose what to install but whoever is going to look at a list of Kthis and Kthat and have the remotest idea whether they need the update or not  - and who thinks up their names anyway.  I don't WANT something with the word Malicious in it's name on my computer but hey, do I get a choice?  It really does start to make you think that the pre-creation days when the world was gently populated by such creatures as Dos, where people communicated WordPerfectly and grew Lotus123's, sigh, perhaps those really were the "good old days"!  :-)</div>
<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-26 2:38</div>
<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Yeah, the good old days.<br><br>Forget Microsoft's search.  You might like Google Desktop, it really does come in handy.  It finds a word if it is a file name, an email, a folder, or a web page you visited.  You hit CTL twice and it pops up a small dialog box where you put in the word then it instantly shows you what it finds ... well, the first four or so then offers to pop up a browser window to show you the rest.<br><br>But the real thing is that it does not eat up the CPU.<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-26 8:46</div>
<div class="content">Mike<br><br>Thanks for that - I'll put it on my list to check out.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-26 17:50</div>
<div class="content">The problem I found with Google Desktop (and some other similar search programs) is that it won't let my Acronis Image Backup work. Since I am paranoid about backing up every day because of some total disasters in the past this simply rules the program out for me.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to everyone for their comments. I was using page up and down to get around this, but now I have discovered the Home and End buttons, which will be really useful.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I took a look at the issue and the problem is that IE6 doesn't honor CSS width specifications if a child element is bigger than ... well, you can fix it like this:<br><br><a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/markforster-ie-issue.txt" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/markforster-ie-issue.txt</a> <br><br>I put it in a text file because your forum does remove HTML from posts.<br><br>I hope I didn't write too unclear.

<div class="meta">2009-02-28 7:31</div>
<div class="content">Laurence:<br><br>The links come first on your pda because they are first in the HTML code. It would be easy to remedy this by changing this by reordering them in the HTML and then change the CSS to swap them around so they'd look the same in normal browsers but the content would appear before the sidebars on mobile devices.<br><br>If Mark would like me to, I could do that for him. For free, of course, after all he gave me for free.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas and Mark, many thanks for looking into this and perhaps amending the layout, I use t-mobile's web 'n' walk so am online with my pda a lot, and it would make it a lot easier for me.<br><br>Laurence</div>
