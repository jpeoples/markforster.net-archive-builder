<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Here is the link:<br><br><a href="http://www.davidco.com/forum/showthread.php?t=9515&page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidco.com/forum/showthread.php?t=9515&page=2</a><br><br>By the way, new comments by Testeq state that he would rather think like David Allen versus Mark Forster.  Well...I am not sure what to say about that.  Me personally...I would like to think like David Drake....and learn from Mark Forster.  <br><br>To be fair, David Allen has a lot to offer as well.  <br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Hmmm... I don't get the impression from Testeq's comments that following the GTD system has made him think much like David Allen!</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>I think David meant "he would rather think like 'David Allen vs Mark Forster'", meaning Testeq point of view is war of the systems where there can be only one truth, instead of a cooperative mutual learning process where everyone takes the best of the different approaches and sees what works best for him.<br><br>... My interpretation could be wrong of course. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>You said:  "Hmmm... I don't get the impression from Testeq's comments that following the GTD system has made him think much like David Allen!"<br><br>I don't know if you've run across it in your travels but a good read is "The True Believer" by Erick Hoffer:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/True-Believer-Thoughts-Movements-Perennial/dp/0060505915/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242299672&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/True-Believer-Thoughts-Movements-Perennial/dp/0060505915/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242299672&sr=8-1</a><br><br>In this rather short book, Hoffer really gets to the heart of what makes a person a "true believer".  His thesis is that it has more to do with the personality of the believer than the tenets of whatever he believes in.  Some people get their sense of identity from the larger "cause" they belong to.<br><br>IIRC, Arthur Koestler also touched on this idea in "Darkness at Noon".</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br><br>Let's call your position "syncretism." I am firmly in your camp.<br><br>I look at it this way. I have gotten much more out of AF, having read and done DIT first, than if I hadn't. There are many subtleties to DIT that have developed into habits which have served me well as I do AF. <br><br>It all depends on one's perspective. One could focus on how very different DIT is from AF. And it is true. There are differences. Or one could focus on how AF has built on the strengths of DIT, while addressing some of its weaknesses.<br><br>I view the relation of AF and GTD in a similar light. Years of GTD have ingrained in me many useful habits. I still retain almost all of these habits as I do AF. With AF I feel that I have taken GTD to a much higher level. <br><br>From my syncretic perspective, GTD and AF are compatible.</div>
