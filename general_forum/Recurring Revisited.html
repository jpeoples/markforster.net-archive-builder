<div class="content">Posit: I have a recurring daily task. I enter it 1 month from today. Later today, I perform this recurring task. Question: Do I re-enter it 1 month from tomorrow crossing off the original list as completed? To save re-entries, do I leave it open on the original entry and only re-write it when that original date becomes today? If I have only 1 recurring task, option A seems reasonable, but if I have a half-dozen tasks that are done daily, rewriting them all each day would probably cause me to simply not put them in, and thus get overlooked. A related question - what about tasks that occur more than once per day?  Thank you for any hints, suggestions.</div>

<div class="content">What I do with my daily recurring tasks is the following: I put them in a separate section on top of the page, the section is separated by a line from the rest. This section is the same every day (well, slight modifications on weekends).</div>

<div class="content">TerriC,<br><br>This new system is the first that really works for me for both of the issues you raised.<br><br>Recurring tasks:<br>They always get entered one week from today. It's very simple.<br><br>One of my many recurring tasks is to set up a desktop computer outside my office that automatically sends items to a printer. Typically, I set it up once each morning. What if we bring the servers down? Then I will do it twice in one day. I keep writing it again and again one week from today.<br><br>"Check MarkForster.net" is something that I wrote once today on March 10. I will mark it done. And I will rewrite it for March 10. After lunch I will probably do it again, and rewrite it again.<br><br>The other AFs, except AF3, had byzantine requirements that forced me to do at least one item from this page or that section before I could turn on the printer or look at yesterday's sales figures (examples of recurrent tasks). AF3 was better in that regard. But AF3 allowed me to leave old stuff untouched forever.<br><br>This new AF combines the sensitivity to and adaptability to a rapidly changing environment with a rigorous algorithm that prevents me from biting off more than I can chew.</div>

I've been doing the task "Reply to Comments" four or five times a day since the system started and it works great.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, all, for your replies. I had a feeling multiple 1-week entries was the way it would work, I just have an ingrained resistance to repeating things. It probably stems from years of work with databases - never repeat data such as names, invoice numbers, etc. Create a new data table to prevent word/spelling variations from occurring. However, since this system works so well electronically, I can set up VBA to handle it.</div>

<div class="content">Terri, you aren't really repeating things.  You enter a new copy of the task only after you delete the old one.  You could move something without copying. It would have the same physical effect, but you might lose a psychological effect.</div>
