<div class="content">I am really enjoying this. I was wary of making lists, because it is too easy to keep adding trivia. However, keeping a rolling list makes sure that nothing is forgotten. I have been choosing the tasks that stand out and which I am resisting the least. I seem to work faster on these, which means I am working more productively. Interestingly, all of the other tasks stuck out at some stage, even those I thought I would resist forever. It's a great system so far.</div>
