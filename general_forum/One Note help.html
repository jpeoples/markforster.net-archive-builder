<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>@ Seraphim and others, can you tell me how you use OneNote to build your FV list?</div>

<div class="content">vegheadjones, I tried searching "onenote FV list" in the search box to the right but didn't come up with anything useful.<br><br>Try posting your question on the "FV forum," rather than this general forum, and you may get a better response. I know Seraphim has written about this ... somewhere!</div>

<div class="content">Create a section for your list.  Create a blank page as header for the list.  <br>Ctrl-N to create a task.  Type.<br>Send emails to OneNote to create a task.<br>To mark a task in FV, I indent the page by dragging right.  <br>After working on a task, drag it to the bottom, not indented.<br> <br>Above is all you need to do.  In addition I have a couple other practices:<br>1) I split sections when they get too many pages, only because it's easier to read.<br>2) As a variation on the rules, I have a separate section for new tasks and a section for tasks I worked on today.  All just treated as part of an FV list.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks . Alan when you send an email it goes on its own page, yes?  How do you add that email to  the FV task page?</div>

<div class="content">And thanks Bernie. I posted it here since I didn't see it as an FV question specifically, and I will feel bad if I double post.  Hopefully Seraphim here's my plea :)</div>

<div class="content">You seem to misunderstand me. There is no "the FV task page". There is an FV task section, and all its pages are tasks.  Outlook's Send to OneNote command creates a page, and I only need pick the FV section as where to put this page to make it an FV task.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, so your list goes across tabs, rather than vertically? Do yo use tags or anything to create a vertical list?</div>

<div class="content">Nope.  Maybe going back to the origin of the idea will help:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/903819" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/903819</a><br><br>One section.  Each page in the section is a task.  No tagging.  No special rules for pages.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Alan. I got it set up and really like how it works. For unrelated One Note reasons, I am going to go back to AF1 for the time being,but One Note seems quite suited for that as well.<br><br>Thanks for your help.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry for the delay - I have been away from the forum for awhile!<br><br>I set up things pretty much the same way Alan does.   I also make sure the default location for all new items is the section that holds my FV list.   This ensures that the Outlook "Send to OneNote" command adds emails to the end of my list, screen clippings are added to the end of my list, clippings from browsing the web go to the end of my list, etc.<br><br>I also set up the OneNote button in the Task Bar to create a new task at the end of my list.  It takes a single keystroke (Alt-N) to create a new task, type in a few words, and it immediately appears at the end of my list.<br><br>All of this works great for either FV or AF1.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Seraphim. I have used Onenote now for a few days and really like it. I've been using tags to make an FV list (thus giving me the option to go AF or FV style) as well as using tags to track waiting fors and agenda items. Do either of you use tags?</div>

<div class="content">I haven't used tags but have been thinking about using them for items I need to discuss with my wife.</div>

<div class="content">I don't use tags.  For FV, just indenting the page serves the purpose of marking the page.  To track things I make groups of stuff in other sections and the FV page has links to those groups.  I suppose tagging could serve this purpose instead, but haven't looked into it.</div>
