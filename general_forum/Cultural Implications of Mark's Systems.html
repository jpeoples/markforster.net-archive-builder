<div class="content">One thing that I've been thinking about recently is our use of technology in society, largely because I just dumped the pen and pad and have gone to exclusively using Outlook.  I have to applaud Mark though for the simplicity of his systems, but also how accessible the information is to the public at large.  All you really need to get going in all systems except DIT is access to the web, a pen and a pad.  For those that don't have much money, resources like this are helpful if people know where to find them.  <br><br>I wonder if the next step isn't teaching these systems to those that are low-income, NOT as a solution to their financial state but as a way to become more organized and reduce stress in their lives.  One of the major problems associated with poverty is a lack of organization and lack of ability to prioritize tasks.  <br><br>Has anyone here taught Mark's system to someone else?  Provided a seminar on these methods? <br><br>TK</div>

<div class="content">My experience has been that people don't want any system but their own, or one they have sought out.  Attempts to show them a "better" way have fallen on not quite but almost hostile ears.</div>
