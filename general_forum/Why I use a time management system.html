<div class="content">1. Because I need one place that I responsibly check daily, to ensure that I keep all my commitments. This discipline give me the assurance that I can see myself as a responsible person, which in turn frees me to actually commit to any form of work, without feeling badly about it.<br><br>2. As a way to communicate with myself that, in fact, we (ha!) will (yes!) now (indeed!) start doing some work. The daily dive-in into the productive part of the day.<br><br>3. Conversely to have an agreement when it is fine to stop working for today, or so. Basically, the organisation of working hours, a means to come to a sensible and agreeable schedule of some form. This is also a (psychological) basis for being able to start: to know that it will stop at some point.<br><br>4. Doing things and then crossing them off is a rhythm that helps me with speed of work. It also helps me to keep being focused on doing some more work, instead of goofing off.<br><br>5. While all the above reasons seem to be purely based on common sense, it is also a fun way to get through my days, to have this sense of an "operational headquarters" that the time management system gives to you.</div>
