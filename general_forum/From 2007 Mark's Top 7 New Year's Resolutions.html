<div class="content">Stumbled across this blast from the past today:<br><br>My Top Seven New Year's Resolutions - Blog - Get Everything Done<br><a href="../blog/My Top Seven New Year's Resolutions.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/12/29/my-top-seven-new-years-resolutions.html</a><br><br>FYI, the link in #7 should point to <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html.</a> <br><br>As I recall, Mark's variations on the No S Diet did not meet his expectations. You can read his collection of blogs on dieting and weight loss here: <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/dieting." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/dieting.</a> His last entry in the category captures his experiment with 24-hr fasting; I've also found that fasting was the simplest and most effective way for me to lose weight, and the only one that really made sense to me. But it does not work for everyone so YMMV.</div>

<div class="content">Hmm... looks as if the blog is not quite as much back to normal as I thought.</div>

<div class="content">I see, the link to "can I improve on the no s diet" doesn't work because there is a full stop (period) at the end. This should work: <a href="../blog/Can I improve on the No S diet.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html</a><br><br>The diet related articles are also categorized here: <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/dieting" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/dieting</a></div>
