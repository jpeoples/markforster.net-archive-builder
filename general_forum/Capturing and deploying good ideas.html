<div class="content">David Allen has great ideas on personal management.  Gtd isn't one of them. Ready for Anything, chapter 21 is interesting. <br><br>David says there that great ideas can come at any time but are often quickly forgotten before they have achieved their promise. So two things are needed:<br>1. Record the thought before it escapes you. <br>2. Have it ready when you need it.<br>As examples, he names a great birthday gift idea, and a new seminar tactic.<br>end of D. Allen's ideas. <br><br>An AF list is a great capture tool. An iPhone is a good intermediate means. Shopping lists and speech notes may serve once the AF item is invoked. <br>Other thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">One thing I don't have much success with are little notebooks that slip into the pocket.  For me, they get too cluttered.<br>The most useful tool I have found for capture is an idea I got from Toodledo.  They call them "booklets" and are shown on the scrollable extras at the bottom of their home page. They have the "hotlist," etc., and you can fold it up and stick into your pocket.  You can also, of course, write on it.  <br>So, I put some pertinent info in the quadrants of a folded-up blank piece of paper and use that.  I hate it when some great ideas (or solutions) hit me, or a series of ideas, and I get side-tracked before I can record them or really think about them properly.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>I have the opposite experience, BKK, having a little notebook in my pocket has proved very effective for me.<br><br>Yes, I can attest to how horribly messy it can be, but it is manageable if you use ideas from the "Free-Form Notebook" thread here.  Add to the fact that the same notebook also contains my task management system at the front with the random notes and its index at the back, and I have a relatively complete system of capture.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Hey nuntym -  First of all, I was not referring to a notebook that is intended to have a use, i.e., using the ideas of a free-form notebook.  I was referring to those little bittly notebooks  just for capture purposes.  They don't take up any room in your front pocket even.  <br>The second point is that I agree with you; a small notebook SHOULD work as a  capture device.  It's just that when I see it laying on the counter I never look into it because I am afraid of all the stuff I have probably scribbled into it.<br>Also, folded blank pieces of paper in my pocket wouldn't work, either.  They just look like rubbish when I get home. That's why I liked the Toodledo booklets because they were "attractive" and inviting to look at.  <br>I could never use a small notebook as a "task mangagment system" unless I get into Zen or something and simplified my life tremendously. <br>Anyway, we all got to use whatever works for us, because quick-capture is an invaluable tool sometimes, isn't it?</div>

<div class="content">Coincidently, I just got a Space Pen (black matte bullet) a few weeks ago and was quite positively surprised by the build quality. I'm really enjoying it… <a href="http://youtu.be/0JxG7JNNnKs" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/0JxG7JNNnKs</a><br><br>But you don't need to buy an actual space pen to try it out: the "secret"[1] is in the pressurised refill, which comes with a little plastic "adapter" to work with normal "click-type" pens. So you can buy only the refill and try it out with your current preferred pen (I also bought one refill because I prefer the "fine" version over the "medium" it comes with and it's working great in my old pen). <br><br>[1] under water, zero gravity, upside down, non smudging… all essential stuff in regular office activities these days ;-)</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>@Mark: Fine, your pen's better.  And good goodness, Mark, us comparing pen size? That sounds... >__<<br><br>@BKK: <<First of all, I was not referring to a notebook that is intended to have a use, i.e., using the ideas of a free-form notebook. I was referring to those little bittly notebooks just for capture purposes.>><br><br>Yes, my notebook is as small as what you are describing, considering it's just 3"x5" in size.<br><br><<It's just that when I see it laying on the counter I never look into it because I am afraid of all the stuff I have probably scribbled into it.>><br><br>Yes I would agree! But the solution, at least in my experience, is to be forced to use the notebook, like for example making it my task management system.  Which is the reason why it is always with me, and I always use it.  I always get amused when people tell me I'm like a boy scout when I fish my notebook out of a pocket anytime I need to record something.<br><br><<I could never use a small notebook as a "task mangagment system" unless I get into Zen or something and simplified my life tremendously. >><br><br>Just try it, it might surprise you.  And before you say a regular AF system will not fit into the small notebook, please note that when you open up a fliptop memo notebook, the open two pages become a "virtual page" with anywhere between 25-35 lines, perfect for AF1 ^___^<br><br>@Hugo: <<[1] under water, zero gravity, upside down, non smudging… all essential stuff in regular office activities these days ;-) >><br><br>Definitely! Who knows when I need to write on a water-soaked paper pad while riding a jet doing parabolic flights that simulate near zero G? ^____^<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">As I clearly said when I recommended the pen and notebook, they are for use outdoors (because you can use them in the rain) and when you are in the bath/shower (which is proverbially a time when people get their best ideas). <br><br>I know most of you guys never go outside or take a bath/shower but you have to believe me when I say that there are some people who do.<br><br>Since nuntym said his reason for not using the Space Pen is because his pen is more compact, I don't know why he's objecting to my pointing out that the Space Pen is in fact smaller. I'd have thought he would have jumped at the chance of using an even more compact pen.<br><br>And finally the point about a small notebook is that you capture thoughts which you then transfer to your main system as soon as you get back in the office. So there should be no reason to resist looking at it.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>@Mark: Goodness gracious, no, I am not objecting! But reading again what I typed before, maybe I was a bit standoffish; that wasn't my intention, Mark, sorry.  But basically I am really, truly delighted with my Zebra Telescopic pen right now so I am not looking for another currently.  I mean, isn't it cool to have a pen that can change its length at whim?  But the Space Pen IS in my possible wishlist when I get tired of my current pen.<br><br>Although, couldn't ordinary ballpens still be used in wet conditions, and can be used upside down for a very limited amount of time?</div>

<div class="content">numtym:  Thanks for that - and I agree with everything you say about the notebooks, including "to be forced to use the notebook, like for example making it my task management system".  It sounds so simple, like Mark's statement above, "transfer to your main system as soon as you get back in the office. So there should be no reason to resist looking at it."  <br><br>I guess what I was doing concerning the capture thing was admitting yet another weakness (resistance) I have with basic principles.  I realise this "laziness" factor could cause something very important to fall through the cracks.<br><br>It's funny, you mentioned that people tell you you're like a boy scout when you fish out your notebook.  Just an example to note how different animals "we" are from others:  Yesterday my usual BKK buddies (British, Canadian, American) came over to fetch me and nobody could even BELIEVE I wanted to carry a simple pen in my pocket (much less a 'Space Pen').  They could not fathom the idea of why I would ever need to a pen at the restaurant or at the pub.  These people would never use any list more involved than a shopping list, if that.  Hard to knock it, because they seem to get on just fine, but it is amazing just how different we all are.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using OneNote for universal capture.   <br><br>I've set it up so that new OneNote items appear on the last page of my OneNote-based AF List.<br><br>If I want to write down a task or idea that occurs to me, it's one click  (Windows-N) to open a new note, write down whatever I want, and I'm done.   The note appears at the end of my AF list automatically.<br><br>If there is a file I need to deal with, I can copy the file, open a new note, and paste the file into the note.  It appears at the end of the AF list automatically.<br><br>If I am browsing the Internet, or reading my Gmail in a web browser, I can select the text, graphics, or links of interest, and right-click and choose "Send to OneNote".   Again, it appears at the end of the AF list automatically.<br><br>Same with Outlook email - one click and it goes to my AF list.<br><br>If we are using a white board in a meeting, when we're done I take a photo of the white board with my Android's camera, and email it to myself -- one more click and it gets into the AF list.<br><br>If I am out and about, I usually use my Android phone to email myself a note.   When I'm back at my desk, one click gets that email into AF.<br><br>If my hands are not free to write an Android email, then I can call my work phone number and leave myself a message, which shows up in my Outlook email, which gets moved to my AF list with one click.<br><br>Admittedly, I don't have an elegant solution for the proverbial ideas-in-the-shower.   I just keep repeating the idea over and over till I can get to my computer.   :-)   That approach doesn't work when spelunking underwater, however.</div>

<div class="content">One of the benefits of being female in our culture is it's acceptable to carry a purse. Mine is mid-sized, so I can carry a notebook and pen easily. I feel uncomfortable if they're not in my purse.<br><br>If I'm stressed about something or thinking about a project when it's impractical to carry a purse, I'll carry a sheet of paper with a pen. When I do laundry, the paper goes on the top of my desk to be dealt with.<br><br>Knowing my good ideas will be easy to capture reduces stress. I can also capture phone numbers and the name of a book my walking buddy recommends.<br><br>On the other hand, carrying them all the time can increase stress. Sometimes I'll declare a holiday from whatever's stressing me out and go for a walk paper-free.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket seems to be taking an afternoon's constitutional in the park while Mark is off on a day-hike. :)<br><br>As for a purse, well, you don't have to be female to carry one. I've seen several men's messenger bags that look masculine enough that it wouldn't bother me to carry one. And I've seen a lot more people recently of both sexes that carry a backpack at all times. Regardless of gender or satchel style, I think the term is being generalized into an "every day carry".<br><br>My EDC contains my moleskin, pen, highlighter, notepad and pencil, wallet, keys, phone charger, USB drive (because I'm a nerd), and umbrella. I'll probably be throwing a hoodie in there soon as cool weather will be coming upon us soon here in the northern hemisphere. I would love to replace those first five items with an iPad, and with Seraphim's methodology-- and maybe MobileNoter-- I just might be able to do it. But I, too, will be stranded while showering and spelunking. I'm okay with that.</div>
