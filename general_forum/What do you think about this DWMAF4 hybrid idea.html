<div class="content">As I have stated in another thread, I have tried DWM in a paper diary twice now and have decided I did not like it and have gone back to AF4.  What I missed was my trusty AF4 list a simple spiral-bound noteboook.  I found that I really disliked the adding tasks 30 days or 7 days ahead.  Like others, the idea of having to flip through so many blank pages until a task was found was a bit too much overhead for my tastes.<br><br>But what do you think of this idea?  I am following the AF4 rules in my notebook, but am thinking of adding the dates as in DWM in the margins.  If I have not dismissed a task via AF4 rules, but the date of doom is there, then I will follow the DWM principle and dismiss that task.  I can easily scan my lists and see the date in the margin -- this is much faster for me than using a daily diary.<br><br>So, in essence I am following the AF4 system with the add-on of the dates of doom in DWM.  What do you think?  Is this a silly idea?  Mark, have you tried this approach in your previous testing?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, I posted a similar idea, concerning the use of an electronic system that does not support DWM but does support AF2. My plan is to show the creation date for each task, and manually make re-added tasks a different color. Each day I would delete normal tasks that were 30 days old and colored tasks that were 7 days old. Like you, I agree that this seems to give all the benefits of DWM without a daily planner. But since I have not having experienced "classic" DWM, I could be wrong.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>Interesting, but surely blank pages will only be a "problem" in the first month?  By the time you get to 28 February as "today", nearly every page from 01 to 27 March will have tasks on it, some pages more than others.<br><br>I am finding what others have commented on: DWM is a forward looking system that encourages one to keep up - in "equilibrium" as Alan B stated elsewhere.  Even though some of my DWM tasks have been ported from AF4, I have put their expiry date at the date of entry + 28 days.<br><br>Even though some were already in backlog territory, I still applied the DWM rules.  Thus those "backlog" items have found their way into the future, can be picked up by processing the list, BUT now have the expiry date as well.  I expect some of those currently sitting in early March will be dismissed because they really weren't that important anyway.<br><br>I too have drifted from paper to electronic and back again across the AF evolution, but now feel DWM is more amenable to an electronic approach.  In my case i am using ListPro as described in other replies on the forum today.  I find the Closed List/Current Initiative can  be handled as well and helps me to focus.<br><br>In all this to-ing and fro-ing back and forth, we should always remember Mark's advice from the early AF1 days.  If something really important NOW crops up and/or can be attacked NOW, then DO it!</div>

<div class="content">Good points made by All.  Sigh....I am still not sure.  Maybe it is because in the initial start, all of the tasks are so far ahead and there are all of those empty pages.  <br><br>I do agree that DWM is very easily implemented via electronic solutions. But I do so much on the computer now....I have found, thanks to Mark, that the use of a paper notebook for all of the versions of AF, is so much better.  Having to physically write things down makes one think about it in a different manner.  It is very subtle, but it is there.  Or maybe it is my age and I was not brought up on a keyboard.  I still remember sliderules, note cards when tracking things down in the library, etc.  I love computers and all that they do....but pencil/pen and paper is still nice...<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>Your real problem will be that you will lose the forward looking approach.  If you make one long list and put dates by the entries, you won't be able to move a new task that is just entered and shortly thereafter worked on UP to the one week mark to get that effect ... you won't have a place to write it.<br><br>I guess I just don't see the problem some experience with the number of pages.  It is not pages but tasks that should strike fear into hearts and those will be the same no matter which system one uses.<br><br>One thing you can do to reduce the quantity of tasks is to "chunk up".  Don't write every small thing on the list but rather just put "project names" for some things and have a separate list for the individual tasks.  Upgrade computer is sufficient to remind you of what you want to do or you can have a list of things you want to do.  "Shopping" might be enough with the items on a shopping list.<br><br>Also, don't put the more "trivial" stuff on the list.  You know you are going to eat dinner so don't clutter the list with it.  You will know to wash dishes when the sink is too full.  Lots of things send their own messages.  I need to take out the trash tomorrow morning.  I have forgotten to do it once or twice but the consequences are nil.  I don't write it on my list because I so seldom forget it.  (It has been 30 years on this schedule ;-)<br><br>Mostly, don't look at the list as a whole ... just look at the next task and put one foot in front of the other ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>You are very convincing....maybe Mark should consider you as a spokesperson for DWM. Smiles.... <br><br>I have a lot to think about.  It seems like most people here -- and I really value the opinions, testimonials, approaches, etc. -- think that DWM is the best system yet.   <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">My solution to all the empty pages (which I am whittling down, only a handful left at this point) has been to paperclip them all together and so they turn like one page.</div>

<div class="content">I have done the same thing clipping empty pages togetther, but it won't keep working as those pages fill up.</div>

<div class="content">true, but for the first few weeks, there's up to 3weeks worth of blank pages between the today+7 and 'first DWM day +30" I'm clipping them together too. After that, I'll turn down the corners of pages with nothing on them to make them easier to skip, I think. It hasn't been enough of an issue yet though.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David.  I would not claim DWM is a better system than AF4.  I think they have competing strengths and weaknesses.  AF4 is simple, easy to implement and follow, low pressure.  DWM is harder to do, and higher pressure.  <br><br>AF4 works well for you, so why are you wanting to change?<br><br>For me, I like the idea of choosing tasks to bring forward, and then cycling through those forward tasks.  I think it will help focus more on important tasks. I'm not a particular fan of the multiple pages and dates, but designing a workable system is not easy.  Mark did the hard work, this system works (for me), and I'm sticking to it, until a better way comes up.</div>

<div class="content">AF4 with an added artificial sense of urgency? <br>If it might help, why not try it?</div>

<div class="content">The way you describe the hybrid, I don't see how you will dismiss everything that is to be dismissed when it's time is up.  You would have to do a "dismissal review" daily.  That seems like a chore.</div>

<div class="content">Yep -- not a good idea.  I am staying with AF4.  It works the best for me.  Enough tinkering and testing.  I need to get more work done.<br><br>-David</div>
