<div class="content">Hi - a quick post to share how I use Things. <br><br>1. Create (only) three Areas: "Review", "Backlog" and "Active". <br><br>2. Associate the tag "Autofocus" with each Area. <br><br>3. Drag the tasks you want to start with into "Active" and start the Autofocus cycle. <br><br>4. In Autofocus mode, select "Next" and click the "Autofocus" tag. You have your "Review", "Backlog" and "Active" lists. <br><br>5. When you've reached the point where you can't do any more, drag all the remaining tasks into Backlog. New tasks now go into Active. Drag undoable Backlog tasks into Review and triage. Rinse and repeat. <br><br>6. In Planning mode, select "Next" and click the "All" tag. Drag the tasks you want to into "Active". <br><br>7. Set up your sequence of next actions in Projects and Scheduled. Drag the next action(s) into "Active" when you are ready to work on it. Unfortunately, you've lost the ability to group project by Area but I don't miss it. You also lose the task's Project context when it goes onto the Active list, but again I don't miss it either - because of "little and often", it's easy to remember. Drag a scheduled task into "Active" if you want it to automatically appear on your Active list. <br><br>So Things is acting as a tickler (which Autofocus assumes you have somewhere) and Autofocus is acting as a processing tool to breakdown the overwhelm when Things generates a load of tasks. You can tag and filter tasks with contexts, and get priority cues with dates.<br><br>Very functional on the iPad, too.</div>

<div class="content">You are doing AF4 then, as described?  It's not clear how you are cycling through the 3 lists.</div>

<div class="content">Richard: sounds interesting!<br><br>Do you enter tasks by typing or by handwriting on the iPad?  I use a Toshiba Tablet and am wary of any new device that does support handwriting with a digital pen (Wacom seems to be the current standard, followed by NTrig) and can reject the pressure form the palm or other part of the hand resting on the screen<br><br>The iPad seems attractive, but 'touch' does not mean handwriting, I want a Pad type device that will help me at work first, play and entertainment second.</div>

<div class="content">@Roger J<br><br>"Things" for the iPad uses the keyboard forndata entry.<br>The keyboard pops up when you need it.<br>It works wonders!<br><br>"Penultimate" is a gret application if you want to use a pen.<br>It detects palm and the inking is really realistic!<br><br>I too am wary of using my iPad for games because easing too much for that will transform the device in a game machine in my head. But I do everything with it: consume media, work and play from time to time.</div>
