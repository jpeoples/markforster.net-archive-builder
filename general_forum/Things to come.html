<div class="content">Has everyone noticed Mark's latest blog post? Steel yourselves, everyone. <br><br>I can't help thinking of this dialogue from the film "Things To Come":<br><br>>>><br><br>    Raymond Passworthy: Oh, God, is there ever to be any age of happiness? Is there never to be any rest?<br><br>    Oswald Cabal: Rest enough for the individual man - too much, and too soon - and we call it death. But for Man, no rest and no ending. He must go on, conquest beyond conquest. First this little planet with its winds and ways, and then all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. Then the planets about him and at last out across immensity to the stars. And when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time, still he will be beginning. And he'll still only be up to AF v 99....<br><br>>>><br><br>With a new spring in my step ...<br><br>Chris</div>
