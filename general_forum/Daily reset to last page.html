<div class="content">Lately, my SuperFocus notebook has become my faithful companion during most of my waking hours. I have several routine tasks that I enter each morning (on the last page, Column 1) and want to do early, before commuting to work; e.g., exercise, process In tray, etc. Even though it's a fairly fixed routine, I like entering these tasks and crossing them off. But often, my current page is not close to the last page. So quite soon after entering the routine tasks, I redefine them as urgent, cross them off the last page, and reenter them on the current page in C2. In this way, I don't cheat by jumping straight to the last page.  Still, the process seems somewhat contrived.  I suppose I could just enter them straightaway into C2 of the current page, but I'm not always 100% alert in the a.m. when thinking about all the things I need to do, and it's more natural to write everything in one place before defining some tasks as urgent.<br><br>I'm considering changing the procedure and just doing a daily reset to the last page. This variation implies that one must cycle through the complete list at least once per day, which is good practice anyway.<br><br>An alternative would be to stop entering the routine things, and count on habit and memory to get them done each day.  But I like entering and crossing off some tasks, especially exercise!</div>

<div class="content">ubi:<br><br>I'm not quite clear on why you need to write them on the last page rather than C2 of the current page. Since you say that these are all things that you want to do early, surely you don't need to do any further defining of them as urgent?</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>As I said above, for me "it's more natural to write everything in one place before defining some tasks as urgent." And I usually think of several non-urgent tasks at the same time, which can be handled easily later on.  So it's a combination of early-a.m. brain fog and just wanting to empty my head of everything in one place. I guess I could go slower and make the urgent/non-urgent decision at the point of each entry, with the associated page-flipping that entails…</div>

<div class="content">I rubbed up against a similar problem last night and tonight, that's kind of unique to the latest revision of SF. After I got the kid in bed I had a whole list of housekeeping things I needed to do, but with the new revision if I was already on C1 of my current page, those urgent tasks would have gone on the next page, which was in fact the situation. Nothing on the "current" page made sense to do before dealing with the disaster of the kitchen/due paperwork/etc. <br><br>Now, obviously the common sense rule is what should be followed here - if something has to be done "right now" just do it. And that's what I did (I actually did make a sub-list that I just kept ut of my normal Toodledo folder system) but I would have liked the system to be able to respond to/handle this type of situation.</div>

<div class="content">I just got my copy of Mark's DIT book and am finding that the Will-do list makes a great companion to SuperFocus.<br><br>Many of us SF users already had a "today list" of some sort where we parked these daily items that were waiting to enter C2 later in the day, and I find that the Will-do list accommodates my "today list" very nicely and has even led me to reformulate it better.<br><br>Today was day one, so you know how that is. But really, if you already have a calendar and a daily time schedule that is not in SF, why force your parked tasks into SF before they are really ready? Keep them with your schedule ... or your Will-do list.<br><br>If you are a one-notebook person, the last page of your SF book should do nicely. Draw a line under each day's closed list so you don't waste pages.</div>

<div class="content">I used to enter those kinds of routine tasks into C2.   I'd put them in C2 on the current page since it didn't make sense to work on anything else till those begin-the-day routines were completed.<br><br>After awhile I figured that I should make a checklist and just run through it.  It seemed like it would be more efficient to establish the same identical routine and eliminate any unnecessary steps (such as checking my SF notebook), and would help me stop clogging up C2.<br><br>After about 2 days I didn't really need the checklist anymore.   The routine just works.  DOH!   (I suppose this seems ludicrously basic to anyone who's always followed a standard morning routine...  For some reason I could never get myself to do that before...)<br><br>If there were some part of that routine that could really take place at any "early" time, but wasn't a daily necessity, then maybe that would still go into c2.   For example, I could probably benefit from a semi-regular morning walk.  I think I'll add "morning walk?" as a daily C2 task.</div>

<div class="content">Following on Seraphim's post.  Over the course of several months, I've had the following progression:<br>1. I noticed I kept neglecting to do certain things each day.<br>2. I made a list of routines and tried to follow them.  Sometimes I did and sometimes not.<br>3. I examined the list and simplified it, pared it.  This was hard, but valuable.  Made it into a daily check list.<br>4. I got more consistent.  I didn't always need to follow the list.  I got less consistent.<br>5. I found sometimes it was tedious or awkward doing all the items in one spell.<br>6. Enter "Routines" in C2.  Do it little & often.<br><br>So now routines is a "first thing" and a "evening thing", but it's not a do-them-all-now thing.  Seems to be good, but maybe there's a 7th stage.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, you are right of course.  One thing that I always forget if I'm away from the list for a while is whether or not I've done anything on that page already, so my habit is to just make sure I do something from C1 when i come back to the list. I'm trying to get into the habit of starring things when I start them and not taking them off 'til I leave the page, but I haven't REALLY gotten in the habit of doing that yet.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah:<br><br>My method is to put a small circle ○ at the bottom of each page when I come to it, which I then fill in ● when I have done the first C1 task. The row of circles ●●●●●○ also acts as a convenient way of telling how many times I have visited a page.</div>

<div class="content">I taped a short marker ribbon to my notebook to show the next page with no C1s done, and flick it on when I do the first C1 on a page.</div>

<div class="content">I like Mark's "row of circles ●●●●●○" bottom-margin hack for counting how many times a page has been visited. I was daydreaming about possibly adding right-margin dots to each line, to count how many times a task was skipped, but decided that would slow the process down too much. But having a count of the number of visits, before a page is finally completed or dismissed, will be helpful. One could even add a rule, that if you visit a page that has N circles at the bottom, it is time to dismiss it, where N might be 12 or 20 or however many fill the entire margin.  An obvious upper limit is the number of lines on the page, since at least one task must be actioned on each visit.<br><br> One could also wait to fill the circle until it is time to go to the next page. That way, one could quickly find the current page after closing and reopening the notebook, by flipping through the pages until the unfilled circle is spotted. I use the "lonely dots" technique to tell me whether I've completed a C1 task (and how many) on the current visit, so I don't need the filled bottom circle to tell me that. This technique also marks the current page, but is not as distinctive as the row of circles on the bottom.</div>
