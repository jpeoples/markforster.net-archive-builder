<div class="content">Hi all - I'm currently looking for beta testers for an online Superfocus implementation.<br><br><a href="http://www.autofocusapp.com/sf/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.autofocusapp.com/sf/</a><br><br>Email me at jasonk@bluedevel.com if you have any questions.<br><br>I've spent a few weeks rewriting from scratch to support Superfocus, with a focus on usability.<br><br>For those not wanting to be testers - a month or two should be enough to iron out 80% of the bugs so you are welcome to sign up too, just make sure you visit the /sf/ url.</div>

<div class="content">Very close to the original rules. It works! <br><br>Looks good too. Automatic page generation is a great idea.<br><br>Thanks and good luck, jasonk.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, jasonk! I've signed up and it looks great so far.<br><br>A requested tweak... I combine my work and personal SF by the stalagmite/stalacite method. In other words, I start writing my work tasks from the top down and my personal tasks from the bottom up and make a thick line where they eventually meet.<br><br>I'd prefer to keep work and personal in one notebook, but with some kind of way to distinguish them. What might be easier on a web app is to give me the option to start a new page for a new context even before the first page is finished.<br><br>But I really like it so far. Thanks for offering it to us!</div>
