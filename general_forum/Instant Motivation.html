<div class="content">Hi Palletguru<br><br>Oops, I apologize.  The screensaver is under the Post: A Little Motivation.  I used 1920/1200 resolution.....simply choose any just to get the laugh and a new window will appear rather than the downloading prompts....then you can choose your resolution to easly download it from the new screen produced..  For windows, just do the right click deal right on it and choose save as ... or set to background.   I love it!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I am usually "motivated" to do something after I have started doing it. I am usually ready to do the dishes just about when I am finished drying them.</div>

<div class="content">Hi palletguru<br>I'm glad you like it.  Confession:  Several times a day , when I see those two sentences....it helps to hijack some stupid rationalization I cooked up!  Yeah, sometimes I'm lame!  ROTFL!  I think the artist did a great job....even down to the background choice.<br>It's no nonsense sterility mocks my stupid excuses quite effectively........like the precise slice of a  surgeon's scalpel removing the diseased cyst from my otherwise healthy thinking!  ROTFL!<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">"I am usually ready to do the dishes just about when I am finished drying them." <br><br>Interesting.  I wonder how one does AF without following the most important instruction:<br><br>"Go through the page more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you.<br><br>This is the heart of the system. Don’t try to prioritise items mentally - this will interfere with the balance between the rational and intuitive parts of your mind. Instead wait for a feeling of release about an item. It’s hard to describe but easy to recognise. You just feel that the item is ready to be done. If you go on down the page, you may find that you feel drawn back to that item. Once you get that feeling about a task all resistance to doing the task vanishes, and it becomes easy to do."<br><br>I guess you must just go down the list in sequential order forcing yourself to do everything.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Something standing out and being motivated to do something are two entirely different things to me.<br><br>Things need help getting done. AF helps me discern how I can help in that process. When something stands out, I start on it.<br><br>"motivation, in psychology, the intention of achieving a goal, leading to goal-directed behavior."<br><br>from <a href="http://www.answers.com/motivation" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/motivation</a> under the _Columbia Encyclopedia_ entry.<br><br>When something stands out, it does not mean I have the intent of achieving a goal. It is that very intention that paradoxically undermines my ability to help things get done. By listing the many things *I* believe need to be done, AF allows those things come to the surface that I might have never touched had I followed a goal-oriented approached. Likewise, some of my most important goals just get dismissed.<br><br>AF helps me help things get done. Sometimes those things are what I hoped to get done as goals in the first place, but the approach is not goal driven. Rather than saying AF motivates me, I would say it removes resistance.<br><br>By trusting AF and not worrying about results, I am more helpful.<br><br>In the dishes example:<br><br>It gets put on the list.<br>It may eventually stand out (I don't want to do them, nor am I dreading it; it simply is the next thing to help get done).<br>If it stands out, I start.<br>Somewhere along the way I sometimes find myself wanting to do the dishes.<br><br>Thankfully, that last part is unnecessary to the whole process but is great when it happens especially the sooner.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Listing things that need to be done IS a "goal oriented approach."  <br><br>I'm sure nobody says they just love doing dishes, there probably isn't a burning motivation TO DO those items - or most items on most people's lists, rather to "have them done."</div>

May the force be with you!"<br><br>Learning, <br>Great wallpaper, but alas, I will have to give it a miss. With a 7 year old popping into my workspace every now and then, I'm afraid I may not be able to explain the finer nuances of calling yourself stupid (okay) versus calling someone else stupid in the playground (not okay).</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>The wallpaper does not call anybody stupid. It simply admonishes against thoughts that would render your thoughts and resulting actions/nonactions stupid. There aren't many homo sapiens who are untintelligent.  Yet, many of us allow for stupid thinking for stupid reasons.  It helps me anyway to be more alert to this.<br>learning as I go</div>
