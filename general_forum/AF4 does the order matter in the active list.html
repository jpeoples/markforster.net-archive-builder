<div class="content">Hello,<br><br>I was wondering if the order of tasks in the active list had any importance. I have an electronic implementation where re-entering the task at the end is more work that leaving it where it is, and I'd like to know if it will break things not to add (repeating) tasks at the end.<br><br>When you are doing the one pass through the active list, do you often find yourself doing a repeating task several times (as it's added at the end thus is available again during the active pass)?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Alan</div>

<div class="content">That's an interesting question, Barb.  I've wondered that too.  One thing that will be affected for most tasks is that you are supposed to take time to think about why they are being readded.  But for repeating tasks, that does not apply.  And, if the implementation is electronic, then I guess that physical order is not a concept that applies either.</div>

<div class="content">For me, I find it very important to cross off the task and add it at the end of the Open List.  I do take action on many items more than once on each pass through the Open List.<br><br>Email, for example:  While working the Open List, "email" gets done several times.  <br><br>That is, check email, then cross it off and add it to the end.  Then work a few more items on the Open List (and some of them also get crossed off and added to the end again.)  Finally I come to the newly-written email task.  I take action on it again, cross it off, and add it to the end.  <br><br>If I could only do it once each time I come to my Open List, I think I'd fall way behind on email.<br><br>Tasks that are associated with the "pressing work of the day" typically get similar treatment.  Work for 20 or 30 minutes, then cross it off and add to the end.  Work on the next thing for 10 minutes, then cross it off and add to the end.  Etc.<br><br>Maybe this is because I've got one or two big projects, mixed together with a dozen medium sized ones and who knows how many small projects and one-off tasks.  I need to keep pushing forward on all the large and medium projects every day, or else they will get too far behind.  The timed little-and-often approach works great for me here, and the cross-it-off-and-add-to-the-end is essential to making sure everything keeps moving forward in a timely manner.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, regarding giving careful thought to adding items back onto the list.   I am pretty sure that applies only to items that have been highlighted.  If you have done a little work on a task in the normal course of things, and decide to stop and move onto something else before finishing, it's totally fine to just add it to the end of the Open List.  That's just par for the course.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Yeah, I probably got confused there.  We really have a crisis of terminology on this version of AF.  We perhaps ought to define these different ways of "crossing off" with clearer terminology.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the suggestions. I may have a way to deal with this in my electronic implementation at least for tasks that are done often (i.e., email). I'll try it next.</div>
