<div class="content">The Wikipedia article for Mark Forster (author), i.e. me, badly needs updating.<br><br>I didn't write the article, have no idea who did, and have never corrected or amended it. And I'd like to keep it that way.<br><br>However if anyone feels up to the task of amending and updating it, please go ahead. No need to tell me.<br><br>Remember you are not supposed to use primary sources on Wikipedia, which means you can't ask me to confirm details. You should use secondary sources - which would however include this blog, my books and any other published sources you can find.</div>
