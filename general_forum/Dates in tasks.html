<div class="content">Has anybody been including dates - Due by, Deadline, Start by,  whatever...   in their task descriptions?   And in your opinion does it help or hinder resistance to actually doing the task?</div>

<div class="content">Dave<br><br>I do tend to include the deadline - more often this is for an indirect deliverable. For example, "See Joe re input to report due next Tues 20/1".<br><br>To be honest though I could do without it. My deadlines are all on my calendar which I review frequently so my "intuition" is already attuned to them.</div>

<div class="content">I put "hard deadlines" (but only those) left of the check box where necessary.</div>

<div class="content">Like Christian, I put absolute deadlines to the left.  Then I work on items with hard deadlines first, I guess kind of like DIT's current initiative.  It has really helped me to move forward on things I would normally procrastinate on, essentially getting started on long-term projects.  <br><br>Lenore</div>
