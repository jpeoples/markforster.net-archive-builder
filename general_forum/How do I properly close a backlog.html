<div class="content">Hi Mr.Forster,<br><br>On page 138 of Do it Tomorrow, you state, "Working at it first thing every day can make huge inroads into the backlog very quickly.  That is, of course, provided that you have closed the backlog properly."<br><br>Well. . . what are the ways to properly close a backlog?<br><br>Are certain methods conducive to certain outcomes?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Bob</div>

<div class="content">As I just eliminated my backlog this very day (loud huzzahs!!) I feel drawn to answer.<br><br>I'd say you draw a line and don't let anything else in. The difficult part is addressing the overcommitments/ overscheduling/ inefficiency and general limp-wristedness that allowed it to grow in the first place.<br><br>Still some work to do in that respect, I'm afraid :o)<br><br>I'm looking forward to Mark's thoughts as to whether there is a "method" of closing off.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Will</div>

<div class="content">Scan down this list. It's already been thoroughly addressed. MF also leads you to his posts referring to this as well. It'a about half way down and is titled Clearing Backlogs dated October 10, 2006.</div>
