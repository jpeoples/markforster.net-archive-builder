<div class="content">And with a nice chianti.  <br><br>I think Pavlina's TM approach (and approach to life) makes more sense to me now that I see that his 2010 focus is exploring dom/sub.   Not makes sense to me in the sense that I'd want to follow it, but sense in the sense that he wants to dominate his world.<br><br>If that makes any sense.</div>
