<div class="content">I've been searching for a good notebook to keep in my pocket.  The best I've found so far is a card-cover, 70x120, with 80 pages, but I doubt it will last..  The day planner pocket things you can buy seem like the right size, material, for exactly this use, but they are all expensive and preprinted with annoying things like calendars, hours, divisions, and whatever.  I just want cheap lines.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using Field Notes for a couple of years now and they're perfect for me.

<div class="content">I've been using a mini-composition notebook 4.5" x 3.5" with 80 sheets (160 pages) .  It looks like the typical composition book, with black and white speckled cover.  Got one or two at Walmart once for $0.88 each, then discoved a three pack for $1 at a dollar store.  I haven't had any problem with them not lasting.  I use one for my SF list, and I have one in each vehicle as a maintenance log.</div>

<div class="content">I love field notes too - but find them a little small for my todo lists - I tend to keep one in my bag for odd notes on the run.

<div class="content">I like the 9x14 cm spiral notebooks, 100 pages ruled in squares, with glazed cardboard covers, sold in French supermarkets for about 1€. They fit in a shirt pocket, but there are also 11x17 for bigger pockets. I have seen similar ones in Tesco in Britain, A6 size I think, with ruled lines. Now if there was some way of attaching a pencil...</div>

<div class="content">leon, avrum:<br><br>Each morning I draw a line to start a new day and write the date according to the calendar we use at work – the workweek we’re in and the day (today is 46.Wed).  I guess I’m using a hybrid of Mark’s AF/SF (I have no idea which one) and Alan Baljeu’s “Here It Is”.  I treat the last couple of pages as a closed list and work through them once, then work the previous four pages, then return to current, then back where I left off, then to current, etc.  Work and home are in the same list.  I get reminders on my iPhone (via Due) for things that must get done, especially at home since I don’t check my list for home items very often.<br><br>I do “all” of my work from my desk on my PC through Outlook email and in phone meetings, so a lot of what I do (database, Excel, answering questions, providing information) does not get recorded in my list.<br><br>It’s nothing special.  I’m just using what works for me until Mark publishes his next iteration.</div>

<div class="content">tarentola: " Now if there was some way of attaching a pencil..."<br><br>Take a strip of duct tape and carefully fold it in half lengthways to make a thinner strip which is the same length and no longer sticky. Wrap into a loop and clip your pencil in. Then work out where on the book to attach it and use another piece of duct tape to secure it.  I've done this in the past, it works.  You can also cut a piece out of the first strip to leave a sticky section at each end after folding and attach it directly. Duct tape is ace!  I got this from an idea after watching a video on making a duct tape wallet (google will tell you more on that).</div>

<div class="content">Zane, <br><br>Thanks for the information. Dividing up the days with a line has given me an idea: <br><br>The rules, or guidlines are: <br><br>1. AF1 method is followed, except that the closed list is now a day. The list for the current day can be left open during the day so that new entries can be added.<br>2. Urgent items are marked with a 'U' (or other symbol) at either side of the task, preferably to the right. These can be done at any time and in any order. <br>3. Items that need following up in the future can either go onto the list, or onto an external reminder system for re-entry later (e.g. tickler, Outlook tasks). <br><br>This approach will likely require a more aggressive dismissal approach. A good thing if one does not like long lists (I don't). Not so good if plenty of passes are needed to allow for incubation. <br><br>Comments?</div>

<div class="content">tarentola: " Now if there was some way of attaching a pencil..."<br><br>With spiral-bound notebooks I've always used a ballpoint pen and put it down the wire spine as Will suggests. The clip on the pen holds it in place.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the suggestions on attaching the pencil. The spiral on the pocket-sized 100-page notebook is too narrow to hold a pencil, so I am now trying with small pieces of Velcro, one at each end of the (short) pencil and attaching on the notebook near the spiral on the front cover.</div>

<div class="content">I've found with all cheap pens, biros, the ink balls up on the trailing edge of the nib when drawing lines through things. This then smudges or has to be wiped off on a spare bit of the page. It gets worse as the pen gets more used. Any suggestions for a cheap brand which specifically doesn't exhibit this?  I'm not keen on gel pens as an alternative.</div>

<div class="content">Chris L:<br><br>I used to find that with the Bic Cristal, but they seemed to have improved it recently so it doesn't happen so much. All ball point pens seem to suffer from this, whatever their cost, and I think the Bic as now as good as any.</div>

<div class="content">Another method of attaching a pen/pencil is to put it inside the front cover and put a strong rubber band round the notebook. This serves the double purpose of keeping your notebook safely closed as well as the pen secured.</div>

<div class="content">Chris L,<br><<I've found with all cheap pens, biros, the ink balls up on the trailing edge of the nib when drawing lines through things.>><br><br>My absolute favorite is the Pilot G2. The ink does very occasionally ball up, and once in a while I seem to get a bad one that keeps balling up even after I wipe it clean. But the vast majority of these are smooth and trouble free. These pens fit very well into most spiral bindings, and the clip locks them in place.<br><br><a href="http://www.pilotpen.us/ProductGroup/35-G2.aspx?ProductId=111" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.pilotpen.us/ProductGroup/35-G2.aspx?ProductId=111</a><br>0.7 mm is good for regular use, 0.5 mm is good for check registers or small journals.<br><br>They are calling it a "gel roller." The ink is formulated with a gel, probably the reason for less smudge, but it feels like a very smooth ballpoint.</div>

<div class="content">As much as I love my Field Notes pocket-sized graph-ruled books, I'm planning on trying Moleskine Cahier Pocket Squared next time. Advantages: 64 vs 48 pages, stitched vs stapled spine, perforated last few pages, and the back pocket.  Similar price (excluding shipping).  Only downside I see is that they're actually manufactured in China (FN are made in the States).

<div class="content">Personally, I use Rhodia webnotebooks for my task list.  It's pretty much the exact size of a moleskine pocket but with far superior paper and in my opinion a nicer cover.  You can find them here:  <a href="http://www.rhodiapads.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.rhodiapads.com/</a><br><br>I also use a quiver double pen holder on it that holds my fountain pen and highlighter.  You can get quiver holders at www.quiverglobal.com.  They are a FANTASTIC price and look/feel great.<br><br>FYI, i have absolutely no connection with either company.  I just love their products.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Brett</div>

<div class="content">will<br>you are right, China DOES have great tradition of paper and writing. perhaps even invented both?<br><br>my comment was more from that Moleskine gives off a whiff of brand/history all steeped in Italy, which certainly is known for craftsmanship, and then really turns out to be from China.<br><br>yet perhaps OK, China makes the iPhone, certainly should be able to make a notebook - so might not really be an issue.<br><br>while some of the others do seem to be actually from their country that they say they are from.<br><br>this is all somewhat arbitrary in such a global economy, where everything is made from everywhere and goes everywhere. so maybe it matters, maybe not. overall, the quality does seem to be better with Rhodia and related.<br><br>finally, I'm aware of some ironic aspects that China has "taken" business away for such things as manufacturing of porcelain, which were in fact stolen from China in the first place.<br><br>so no problem, for me, with China or most of their products.<br><br>( i do have a problem with USA companies endlessly closing down USA based factories to make instead in China - eventually USA will only make pizza deliveries and movies - that being somewhat from Snow Crash )</div>
