<div class="content">Hi,<br>This is not ad! ;-)<br><br>Due to a more or less sleepless night I searched the web for an easy but efficient note taking app.<br>What I found was cintanotes (<a href="http://cintanotes.com/)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://cintanotes.com/).</a> I run my privatetask on paper, but cintanotes has a good changes to substitue my worklist - I will try this after my vacation ;-)<br><br>What stands out IMO:<br>- plain list sorted by entering date (important for AF)<br>- tagging (great for assigning projects and/or merging AF with GTD if you want)<br>- great search feature<br><br>Worth a look!<br>Take care,<br>Jens</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Jens.<br><br>Looks like CintaNotes is well worth exploring for me.<br>I particularly like these features ...<br>* Fast as-you-type searching (very similar to my favourite mobile apps, HandyShopper)<br>* Portable. Run it from your flash drive.<br>* DropBox synchronization without closing the program.<br><br>I wonder how it'll fit into my current AFAHK DWM with small text project files setup.<br>I think it may cleanup some of my small text project files.</div>

<div class="content">I don't think this will work for me after all, but I think a great feature this has is the ability to move a note to the bottom of the list by pressing <Alt>+<End>.  If each task is a note, this could be used in a basic Autofocus setup.<br><br>Thanks for sharing!</div>

<div class="content">Cintanotes is cool as a lightweight notetaking program, and the seamless synching across PC's with dropbox has me using it at work, at home and on my laptop.<br><br>Thanks for the suggestion Jens.</div>
