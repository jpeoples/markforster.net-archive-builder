<div class="content">I've adopted the Do It Tomorrow principles and found them life changing.  However, I do struggle with one detail.  In my task diary, I typically write on any given day a single large assignment, and many small todos, mainly following up tasks delegated on previous days.  <br><br>I find I can either get the big task done, or all the little ones done, but rarely the two combined.<br><br>I'm thinking of experimenting with alternating the days.  On odd days, I'll put in my task diary a single large task, such as writing a report, and seek to focus on that without distraction or interruption.  On even days, I'll put in my task diary the little tasks.<br><br>Has anyone experimented with similar ideas?</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>Had you thought of breaking down the big project into smaller more manageable chunks and then putting one or two smaller chunks into your task diary. Or do a timed session on the large project then continue with the smaller tasks? I'm sure Mark covers these options in DIT.<br><br>I've been experimenting recently on doing different types of tasks in the morning than in the afternoon. As I focus better in the morning I've been using that time to work on a very intimidating financial project (broken down into chunks via a checklist of tasks needing to be done) and then doing more 'creative' but less demanding work in the afternoon. I should say I'm self employed and currently working from home as my work is seasonal (gardening) and I'm also an artist so I have an interesting mix.<br><br>I'm finding splitting between morning and afternoon very helpful in keeping both areas moving. If I want some fully focused time for painting then I put that down as my morning project.<br><br>Just a few thoughts, but I hope they might help you to come up with some ideas that work for you and your circumstances.</div>

<div class="content">You might enjoy this post (and its accompanying link) from 43folders.com:<br><br>Choosing a daily GTD action plan | 43 Folders<br>"I often have a theme for a given day, where I choose an approach that’s suited to my mood, my energy level, and the kind and amount of work on my TODO list.

Having it written down means you now have an instantly organized backlog (which is how I've used my daily closed lists, sometimes).</div>
