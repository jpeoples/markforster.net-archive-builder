<div class="content">Ok, while we wait for Mark's SF3 system, I thought I'd share a new system I'm thinking about doing as a test.<br><br>My hand tires easily if I write too much. So, this system is geared to keep from rewriting.<br><br>The basis of the system is AF1 with a few differences. Instead of writing on every line of the notebook, you write on every other line. The empty line below a task is used for dating when you worked on the task. Use 3 and 4 digit numbers for dates (day is always 2 digits): e.g., 101 is January 1 and 1001 is October 1.<br><br>So, if a task is completed with one effort, then there will only be one date on the line below it. If a task requires several efforts, then the line below will have a number of dates corresponding to when you worked on it, with the last date in the list being the last date you worked on it. If you were to work on a task so many times that there is no more room to write dates, then scratch through the task and rewrite it. On the line below the rewritten task, write the number of times it's been worked on, circle the number, and then put the date you rewrote the task.<br><br>This will serve to keep the list from artificially expanding. In addition, it will help to keep you from fooling yourself into thinking you've accomplished quite a bit, when in reality you've only crossed off a lot of insignificant items and moved a bunch of items with little-and-often. It gives you a better read on what you're accomplishing.<br><br>At the beginning of the day (or at the end of the day making ready for the next day) review the entire list of tasks. Flag as many or as few of the tasks that stand out by using Post-It Arrow Flags. This becomes your closed list to start the day.<br><br>Pulling the flag off of a task when you've done work on it gives you the psychological boost you need to keep going. Once you've finished the Flagged Tasks or none of the Flagged Tasks stand out any more, then you have completed work on your "closed list" and you then move through the list as you would in AF1.<br><br>Use AF1 dismissal rules – that is, when you cycle through the tasks on a page and nothing stands out, then highlight the tasks for dismissal. If the review of a task shows that the task is still valid, then rewrite at the end of the list. On the line below the rewritten task, write "D1" and circle it, write the number of times the task has been worked on, circle that number, then write date you rewrote task.<br><br>Using College-Ruled paper will allow you to put more tasks on a page than with regular-ruled paper. Or, you can use two columns on a page. In this case you would try to write your tasks in as few words as possible leaving room in the second column to write the dates.<br><br>I think I'll give this a try. <br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I guess if you didn't care about knowing the dates of when you worked on a task, you could always track the number of times you've worked on a project by marking a vertical line "|" every time you work on it. Every fifth time you work on a task you mark a "/" through the previous four "|" lines. This will easily show blocks of 5 times worked. <br><br>You can put this on the same line as the task. This might help those concerned with having half the tasks on a page they normally would have.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">For pages with recurring tasks, (For example I have a sheet for gym exercises) I'm already following this scheme.  <br><br>Using grid paper, I write the tasks down the left side of the sheet.    Each time I work on something, I mark a square to the right of the item. <br><br>The second time I work on it, I mark the second square.  Then to keep things aligned,all other tasks I do also get marked in the second square to the right of those (even if it's the first time for those) , so I know "when" I've done it.<br><br>The mark in each square can be a date, a check, a line, a block, or (for workouts) - the reps and poundage.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Thanks for your comment -  I like your grid idea. For me I prefer not to keep a separate list for recurring. This is why I prefer dates. I can see the last date I did something. I can easily tell if it is a recurring task. And, it gets flagged appropriately in my daily review.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">You may test but i dont think it is very efficient. May be for you, but not for me LOL. <br>There is a strange effect with AF1 the most you rewrite and the most you reformulate the most things advance. If you have a lot of recurring task take a special page and put it all on it. Then write on AF1 work on current initiative.</div>

<div class="content">You may be right, Jupiter, but the proof of the pudding is in the tasting. So, I will try it out. <br><br>I can't really try it for another 10 days, because I'm going on a cruise this Saturday. And, I've got too much to do between now and then to convert. But, I will do it when I get back.<br><br>I'm not sure I agree that the "strange effect" of AF1 is that the more your rewrite and reformulate, the more things advance. Even if I agreed with your point, the effect would be the same, because the dating is the equivalent of rewriting....except without all the work.<br><br>I think there is enough promise in it to try it. I think it will keep the number of pages down and help keep me focused on actually accomplishing tasks rather than just working on tasks. And, I think it can accomplish this without losing the unique qualities of all AF systems: intuition and little-and-often.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Hi 2mc,<br><br>I like your idea: <br><br>I think it would be of value to record and track 'starts made' with some sort of marking, e.g. a tally mark. E.g. how many starts did it take to complete this task?<br><br>Maybe there needs to be some sort of mark though to indicate which task is currently active? In a similar way to Mark's 'dot' in AF versions. Maybe a / indicates a start and an X indicates a completion at that point in time? I.e. the / indicates that this is the active task.<br><br>At the beginning of the day 3 / could be marked to indicate which tasks will be worked on next - following the Triple Tasks methodology. <br><br>I'm aware you do not like re-writing tasks however I like the idea of a weekly list that, at the end of the iteration, data can be collected and evaluated. What tasks have not been worked on at all or very little? Can these be dismissed?<br><br>In this way the AF Rules are maybe not needed and all items on the list are potentially accessible at the same time, along with the added benefit of a set day (e.g. at the end of the week) to cull waste tasks on the list.<br><br>Hmmmm, I may even try it myself!</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>>I think it would be of value to record and track 'starts made' with some sort of marking, e.g. a tally mark. E.g. how many starts did it take to complete this task?<<br><br>That's already in there. You can count the number of dates or if you don't use dates, then count up the |'s.<br><br>>Maybe there needs to be some sort of mark though to indicate which task is currently active?<<br><br>If it's on the list, it's active. But, if you mean marking the list, so that you know where you were last working, then i suggest writing "LAST" on a Post-It Arrow Flag and positioning it on the current task. That way if you get distracted by a phone call or some interruption, then you can remember where you were. Or, if you finish a task, then you know where it is in the list and you can pick up there.<br><br>>At the beginning of the day 3 / could be marked to indicate which tasks will be worked on next - following the Triple Tasks methodology. <<br><br>I'm not sure I understand the "day 3" reference, but the Flagged Tasks take the place of Triple Tasks.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I went ahead and started. I wanted to see if it would take care of the pressing things I had to do and I wanted to see how it would handle a vacation. That I'll know when I get back.<br><br>First impressions are that I like it. I still get the "feel" of making progress, but I'm not getting a false sense of progress, because tasks I don't complete but only worked on are right where they were. So, the list isn't expanding as fast as with AF1.<br><br>The Closed List of Flagged Tasks is still working great.<br><br>I haven't done it long enough to see if the effect of NOT moving uncompleted tasks, but only dating or checking the task when work is done, will lead to tension that not enough is being done. I don't think this will be the case, because the string of dates will probably serve the same purpose as moving. We'll see.<br><br>I'll keep you posted.<br><br>Matt</div>
