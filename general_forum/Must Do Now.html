<div class="content">Apologies to all if this has been discussed before, but after looking further into AF it become obvious very quickly that the over-riding principle of doing "must do now" actions prior to completing tasks in AF is vital.   <br><br>I would like people's views on what "must do now" asctually means.  <br><br>For example at one level, "must do now" means prepare for today's meetings, at another level its everything that is overdue (on my list I'm unfortunately thats a large amount of items), or is it somewhere in between?  I<br><br>t seems to me that in order to complete all "must do" items before using AF - we have the option of simply completing items "on our mind" or we could scan the whole AF list and make a short list to be completed "now".    This is similar to the index card amendment proposed and dropped by Mark previously, because it created resistance to using the normal AF list.  <br><br>Presumably then that leaves only the option of removing all "must do now" actions from "your head" before opening the AF list? - is this how most people operate AF?<br><br>I was thinking of creating a shortlist every morning to be dealt with BEFORE i open my AF list, not in combination with the AF list (i.e as a bookmark), so as to avoid creating any resistance to using the AF list, in fact it may even help?<br><br>I now have a "pre-AF" routine as follows:<br><br>Morning Review Checklist										<br>Clear "Do it RIGHT Now" Actions								<br> # Review todays calendar and schedule preparation for meetings 								<br>Collect - do all actions less than 2 minutes									<br>#	Clear desk & notes into in-tray									<br>	Clear out-tray & clear RG in-tray									<br>	Clear in-tray									<br>	Clear email, delete 4P emails									<br>	Clear 4P									<br>						<br>Complete "Must do Now" Items										<br>#	Scan AF list (starting backwards) and select up to 3 "must do now" items									<br>	Repeat AF backward scan until first AF page is reached nothing must be done now									<br>										<br>"Autofocus"										<br>I'll let you know how I get on with this, one worry I have is that I will end up working backwards creating a shortlist continually withot ever working AF normally!<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Derek <br></div>

<div class="content">I have a simple technique for "must do now" items : every morning I quickly read through my AF list, and I highlight in yellow all items that really must be done today. <br>Then I go through the pages again, actioning only these highlighted items before going through the rest of the list. <br>It's easy enough because I usually have 4-5 active pages only.<br>The trick is to strictly discriminate what HAS TO be done today, and to not include what I WOULD REALLY LIKE to do today.<br><br>The good thing is that if ever one urgent action is not done (eg you can't reach someone on the phone), it still there, highlighted. So during the day, while you go through the pages, it jumps to your eyes that an urgent item is still undone. <br><br>Actually, I do that any time of the day, when I get the impression I have stuff to do that just became urgent. <br><br>The good thing about that is that if I have 3 urgent items, I have no fear of forgetting to carry on to the rest of them when I start acting the first one. A quick glance at all the pages and they are there.<br><br>If one stays undone, and there is no consequence, I knox I have to tune up my estimation of priorities and urgency...</div>

<div class="content">@Alex I like the idea of highlining items with you have to do today. I find it much better than extract them on a post it. I gona try that and report. Thanks</div>

<div class="content">For me this was a great revelation of Mark Forster's books, that in fact there were astonishingly few things that really needed to be done today (usually none). The way I identify them is to imagine what would happen if I did them tomorrow and if the consequences are not dire they go into the processing system for normal actions. Of course, this does depend on the system working well enough that you start on tasks/projects that have a deadline far in the future early enough, so that you don't end up being swamped by actions just before their deadline is due.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Derek<br><br>I've actually given this topic a lot of thought as I am struggling with the "must do now issue".  The conclusion I have come to for what it's worth is as follows:<br><br>I think there are a number of categories of must do now items, and the control of those needs to be looked at differently<br><br>Scheduled Tasks<br>Meetings, appointments etc should be handled through a calendar or schedule, and not through the AF list.<br><br>Genuine Emergency Tasks<br>House on fire, crying child, emergency call from someone in need etc. - such tasks are unforeseen and clearly just need to be actioned as they arise<br><br>Necessary Urgent Tasks<br>Important interruptions, external deadlines etc., While such tasks need to be actioned as they arise, they are more able to be controlled.  Systems should be in place to reduce interruptions and using AF fewer items should become "last minute" and end up in this category.<br><br>All of the above are genuine "must do now" items although the last group can be controlled to some extent.<br> <br>The main areas of difficulty seem to be on perceived "must do now" items or "unstable backlogs".  These may or may not be "genuine" must do now items but do have probably more impact than the above groups.<br><br>Perceived "Must Do Now" Items<br>Habit and custom tasks, preference tasks, and some "want to do now" tasks fall into this area.  This can include things like email, post, household chores etc.  It may be custom to check email 6 times a day but is it habit or genuine necessity?  We may be required to have post opened and identified and perhaps on someone else's desk by 9:30.  That is different to being able to address paper when "it stands out".  If there is a specific time requirement then it should be scheduled in some way.  If not AF can handle this type of task perfectly well.<br><br>Unstable Backlogs<br>This is the area I struggle with the most.  These are the backlogs of tasks that, using the quadrant system, would have fallen into the "important and non-urgent" quadrant, but by virtue of not having been addressed are becoming sufficiently urgent to warrant action.  They may not have a specific timed deadline but the non-doing of them has or will have a massive impact.<br><br>Stable backlogs, ie those that really can be cleared using the "little and often" approach without a major effect on anything else (eg sorting a pile of old photos, cataloguing a DVD collection, sorting an old archive) can be cleared amazingly well within AF, and without effort.<br><br>Unstable backlogs however are a major energy drain, because regardless of the actual impact, perhaps affecting us financially, impacting our efficiency or even our reputation,  they constantly remain in our minds, and as Mel and learning as I go posted, destroying our peace.  In my opinion, if something is genuinely destroying our peace then that is a perfectly acceptable reason for treating it as a genuine "must do".  That is in effect our intuition informing us of it's impact but we need to be honest with ourselves about whether that is a genuine issue or just an annoyance.  However, in my opinion, any of the above effects qualify that area for perhaps emergency measures, such as specific timeblocks or an intensive push to clear it at all costs.  The solution may well vary from person to person.  Having cleared two unstable backlogs and now working on my third and final one (my other backlogs are happily quite stable) I know for me that I have to approach it on the all or nothing basis.  I can manage that within AF using my Tandem tweak but am fully aware that that is not pure AF but rather a means to an end.<br><br>Being able to look at the types of "urgent" items has helped me to look at what works and what doesn't but this is all from a purely personal perspective.  Hope it may help in some way .....  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Many thanks everyone for all very useful posts, like Jupiter I feel drawn to Mike's highlighter approach, principally becuase it allows the most flexibility to add new "must do" items as they occur, this can be useful when the item only requires 5 minutes of time and isnt worth scheduling - thank you Mike.   <br><br>Each morning I'll be allocating time to address highlighted must do tasks (length of time would vary daily), leaving unallocated time for normal AF.<br><br>Thanks again everyone, I love AF - but I love this forum even more!<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Derek.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Norman<br><br>Absolutely agree that "must do" tasks should just be done and clearly you and many others are able to do that.  However a lot of people struggle with that and that is who the post is aimed at trying to help in some way.<br><br>As for whether the "must do" tasks I mentioned above "must" be done I guess that is a matter of opinion.  In my opinion, scheduled meetings, appointments, do count as "must do", as do emergencies, and specific statutory or job related requirements.  I also believe that items that will have a major negative effect if not actioned are "must do" items, albeit not necessarily of the same immediate urgency. However I absolutely believe that some of those can be minimised for the future - some meetings may be unnecessary but just not turning up is not a very professional approach. <br><br>There is a big difference however between short term emergency planning when you are in a situation and long term planning to avoid future repeats of those scenarios.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-14 14:22</div>
<div class="content">I must say I largely agree with Norman. Scheduled events in my opinion belong in your diary, not in the AF list. There is the question of how much time these should be allocated, see<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/760674" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/760674</a><br><br>but such decisions are better taken well in advance, and cannot be regarded as urgent or emergencies. Most statutory requirements can be done tomorrow, unless you have left them until the last minute. To me, essentially the only urgent items are those that will lead to serious injury, emotional distress, or losing my job, if not done within the next hour. Anything else can wait. I minimize interruptions by insisting that all meetings with those I supervise are scheduled in advance, and by using caller display to screen calls (and will usually only answer immediately for a few select individuals).<br><br>Christine, I would be interested though, by what you mean by an "unstable backlog". Can you give an example?</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>You Said: "In my opinion, if something is genuinely destroying our peace then that is a perfectly acceptable reason for treating it as a genuine "must do". That is in effect our intuition informing us of it's impact but we need to be honest with ourselves about whether that is a genuine issue or just an annoyance."<br><br>I hear 'ya, but I have a philosophical problem calling things what they really are not.  So, in my world, either a thing is a "must do" or it is not.  You are basically introducing a change in the standard by which "must do" is measured.  IOW, you might have started with "I'll die if this does not get done." and changed it to "I'll feel really bad if this does not get done."  (BTW, realize that here is no ultimate "must do".  Even if something will kill you it is still not a "must do".  People have died by choice.)<br><br>So I see that changing the measurement standard will work, but it kind of goes against the grain.  IOW, I'd rather decide my categories and standards once then keep them pretty much fixed.  So how about this?  Maybe define items called "will do".  There is no standard for an item being "will do" other than you have chosen to do it and have placed your reputation on the line with respect to actually doing it.  Then "will do" items can be a collection of "must do" and things you have simply chosen to do because they annoy you, keep you up at night, piss off a spouse, or it just simply pleases you to do that thing today.<br><br>Does that ring your chimes?  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jaroslav<br><br>What I was saying above, although obviously not very clearly, was that there should be very few genuine "must do" items.  Scheduled events do not belong on an AF list as I stated above, and I also advocated putting procedures in place to minimise interruptions.  In my opinion the only urgent "must do now" tasks should fall into the emergency bracket exactly as you state, or when there is an externally imposed deadline which we have no control over e.g. boss/tax man.<br><br>Most of the items people perceive as "must be done now" are in fact not vital, such as the need to check email every 5 seconds and AF handles these perfectly.  AF "does" manage these although perhaps not in the way people have become habitualised to and I think this is why some people are struggling to "trust the system" in those areas.<br><br>An unstable backlog is what I use to describe a backlog issue which is impacting on current and potentially future productivity or peace of mind.  The sort of "problem" that could topple over and bring a whole of other things crashing down.  An example could be a backlog in keeping accounts up to date which if not addressed could lead to financial penalties, statutory penalties, lost revenue and inability to see financial issues that can beome major issues for the future.  Another example can be a post backlog which can be quite common for some people, unopened post can lead to unpaid bills, financial difficulties, missed opportunities and unanswered correspondence which creates an impression of unprofessionalism.  <br><br>It is generally the areas that cause this type of backlog that lead to stress when items within them necessitate fire fighting.  Firefighting generally takes more effort than fire prevention - and fire prevention can be handled perfectly within AF :-)  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">In fact most of the things we "must do" or we do are not so important. See the pareto law 80% of result wich only 20% of effort. I notice that Af manage perfectly the item according to  the pareto law. I dismiss many items the next morning reading my all list and it is well like this.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-14 15:45</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Going back to one of your earlier posts I think you said that there are only 2 things we "must do" which were pay taxes and die!  (Or at least I think it was you?).  Actually I would disagree with that  - we have the choice not to pay tax - but there are inescapable penalties (well apart from the really wealthy or so it would seem :-) ....)<br><br>I guess it comes down to semantics to some degree - will do vs must do. Perhaps another way of looking at it is what takes you out of discretionery time, on the baisis that all time is discretionery until we schedule it ......<br><br>If I schedule a meeting or I am taking my father to a medical appointment for example, I would define those as "must do" but they are outside of AF.  I would say checking email is a "must do" but not in any way a "must do now" item - I will do it when it "stands out".<br><br>I have posted severeal times that my use of AF is to a degree inhibited by the fact that I have a number of backlog issues - many of them arising out of my previous company and some which accumulated as a backlog during a period of ill health.  Some of those can be cleared happily with AF using the little and often approach.  Others however have statutory requirements and financial impact which need to be addressed.  Much as I personally would like to "dismiss the lot" they "must be done".  There may be no immediate urgency but the ongoing potential for harm is a factor that must be taken into account - the peace of mind factor if you like.<br><br>Without going into great detail (and I can hear the sighs of relief) I know that those issues need to be addressed before I can move on in some areas.  Therefore, as "moving on" is important that increases the "urgency" of the task.  That "moving on" point may be the threat of the tax man, legal deadlines, or financial impact - that to some extent is irrelevant but what is relevant is the fact that the "time is now".  I think you used a similar illustration regarding your deck Mike, if you decided to move you would need to promote that project on your "urgency" scale.<br><br>I have no problem with calling it a "will do" because I have "decided" to do it, but to my way of thinking it is still a "must do" in that the doing of it is more imposed on me rather than being a totally free choice.  A tax return to me is a "must do" but I do not see a "must do" item as necessarily having "now" attached.  Perhaps that is where the difference between "must do" and "will do" lies - the difference between "I must do my tax return by 31 January" and "I will do my tax return today".<br><br>Does that make sense?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I TOTALLY GET your message.  In short, as I understand it to be (and I happen to concur with you in this respect), you are giving your values as much or more weight than "others" directed deadlines.  You, as you should, reign supreme in deciding what must be done given all the factors involved.  Although all of us must comply with certain societal, legal and other types of standards, requirements and deadlines, you have decided that where you have influence, the bell is going to be around your own neck!

<div class="content">Christine<br><br>I'm also with you on this.  My understanding of AF is that it's a clever and very effective tool to get you into a flow state which is when most of the superior work gets done and when we feel really good about doing it.  I also think that a task generally will 'stick out' when it's finally risen to the top of your mental stack - as Mark says, "it's ready to be done".  Therefore, I see removing any tasks that have risen to the top of the stack because of urgency, stress levels, essentially whatever etc as simply helping to improve the effectiveness of the AF list once you start re-engaging with it using the set rules.  David Allen has always said that when he's consulting with companies/people he simply starts with whatever is on their mind(s) and takes it from there.</div>

<div class="content">I'm probably a very small minority of one on here in how I deal with any task with a very hard deadline attached.  I value peace of mind more than necessarily batching things up to do them when it's "more efficient" to do so.  <br><br>I spent a number of years in an environment where we depended upon other people to provide information to our group with very hard, very tight deadlines.  We always cursed the people who would wait until the last minute, requiring us to work over the weekend to meet our deadlines.  I don't ever want to be that person to someone else.<br><br>For example, I received a request yesterday to get a project done by June 5 and another done by June 16.  If I put this off, to say a week before the deadline, the key people I need to touch base with may be on holiday or busy.  So I will start these projects immediately (ie. map out the scope and list the steps today and get the emails out for requests for information - with a fake deadline for people that wait until the last minute:-) ) and probably finish both of them early next week.   Because I have a habit of doing this, I don't write any deadlines for projects anywhere - what for? - the deadline date is irrelevant.<br><br>Unless today's meetings were only scheduled yesterday, why would one be preparing for them today?  What if you needed to get some information for the meeting and your server was down?  This is like writing a term paper the night before it's due.  (Not that I didn't do that when I was in University.)<br><br>Derek, I don't know your job or how overloaded you are - sometimes there's not much we can do about that, but I do know that in years of working in very deadline driven environments, spending as much time as you can working "on" your job vs. "in" your job will reward you many times over.  <br><br>It's becoming more clear to me that any time that we (and I mean me too) have to step outside the system to get what we need done by not following the flow of AF, we are given a wonderful opportunity to look at what's really going on.  We can choose to use that information to improve our processes etc. or tweak the system to perpetuate the underlying problem.<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>with regard to your 15:45 post, I am not convinced by the tax return example. Firstly, ideally your system, whether AF or DIT, or whatever, ought to have you working on the return well before the deadline, so that it doesn't become an emergency on the 31st January. Secondly, even if you haven't, and don't file your return on time, are the consequences that dire? You get fined and perhaps there is more scrutiny in the future, but it doesn't seem to me to be the end of the world (not that I have ever been there myself). I think that is why I am questioning just what is really an emergency that HAS to be done on a given day.<br><br>Jacqueline,<br><br>I don't think you are in a minority of one, in fact you are saying what I what I was trying to  say above, and which Mark Forster makes very clear in his books. If a project has a hard deadline, then the earlier you start on it the better. But in doing so, it never becomes an urgent task on any particular day, either when you first enter it into the system, or on the deadline day itself (by which time it has been done). So it seems to me that such tasks should never fall into the "must do" category unless things have gone pear-shaped (which of course they do for all of us now and then).</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>The thing is that "must" implies a standard.  Must or ... what?  Must or die?  Then that will be a very small AF list.  You could probably use a single index card for decades ;-)  You must breathe.  You must eat.  You must drink water.  You must get minimum values of vitamins.  Etc.<br><br>Must or live in wretched poverty?  Then you must earn (or steal, I suppose) enough money to pay rent in minimally acceptable accommodations.<br><br>Must or let down your loved ones?  AH, now we come to something resembling real life.  What expectations do you honor?  Raise the kids?  Keep the spouse comfortable?  Impress the neighbors?<br><br>Must or not be unfulfilled?  So now you get to the intellectual dimension.  You need to read, to paint (or at least look at) pictures, to perform (or at least listen to) music, etc.<br><br>That is the point underlying this.  "Must" is not a floating concept.  It is anchored by the standard by which you measure success or failure in accomplishing the task you are talking about..  That is exactly why I proposed "will" as an alternative.  It speaks to what you have DECIDED, regardless of the standard by which the decision is reached.  IOW, I will do this because I must, and I will do that because I want to, and I will do that because while I don't want to my wife wants it and I want to make her happy.<br></div>

<div class="content">Oh dear, what did I start with my initial post?  And all because of a simple question "what does "must do now" actually mean?"  <br><br>learning as i go<br>Thank you for understanding me :-)<br><br>AndyC<br>Thank you too!  Your comment <<removing any tasks that have risen to the top of the stack because of urgency, stress levels, essentially whatever etc as simply helping to improve the effectiveness of the AF list once you start re-engaging with it using the set rules>> is exactly what I was getting at.<br><br>Jacqueline<br>I totally agree that any job with a deadline attached "should" be able to be done before the deadline where there is sufficient notice.  AF handles such situations superbly.  It is when other factors hinder the effectiveness of the list that there are problems but that is in no way the fault of the list.<br><br>Jaroslav<br>I totally agree that the system should easily enable completion prior to the deadline.  However please note that I am not referencing a tax return as a "must do now" item, just a "must do" item and that is the distinction I am trying (and failing miserably I think) to make. I agree with you that initial penalties for not filing "on time" may not be that severe but the fact remains that at some point the tax return still "must" be done.  OK anything can be dismissed if the consequences are not an issue and I guess that comes down to personal choice as to what level of consequences we are willing to accept.  To me a tax return "must" be done "because" I am not willing to go to jail (which may be the end result if I refuse to file it ever!)<br><br>Norman<br>It seems to me that you are confusing what is meant by "must do" as opposed to "must do now".  As I have said above, I believe there are very items that will normally fall into the "must do now" category.  That does not mean everything else on my list should be dismissed as equalling "must never do".  I'm sure you are not saying that there is nothing on your list that needs to be done!<br><br>Mike<br>You sum it up really well - I am so happy to have "coffee" on my list as I "must" drink! :-)  And I'm quite happy to use will do although it doesn't come so naturally - now I could start to question whether that is from an "ought" perspective, from an imperative perspective "you will do xyz ...or else" or perhaps just that US English and UK English unknowingly carry different levels of "imperativeness" (if there is such a word).  But no, please don't answer that or we'll start another debate :-) :-) <br><br>Will<br>Great illustration!<br><br><br> <br> <br></div>

<div class="content">Like some others have said, I am finding that there are very few items that really MUST get done today.  I used to be much more a slave to the urgent, thinking that everything in my in box must be done immediately.  But DIT and especially AF have helped liberate me from that.<br><br>And like Jacqueline said, if you chronically have items that must be handled outside of AF, it really is a wake-up call that something needs to be fixed.  <br><br>I am finding that even if my boss calls an emergency meeting to take place in 2 hours, and I DON'T drop everything to get ready for the meeting, but just keep on working my AF -- everything works out fine.  My boss isn't expecting me to as prepared for these urgent meetings as he would expect me to be for a regular weekly meeting.  If I don't have all my act together for an urgent meeting like that, it's totally fine.<br><br>As a result, I can just keep working my list and stay focused on what's really important.<br><br>If my boss was *chronically* calling urgent meetings, then maybe our project is badly planned, or there are other systemic issues that need attention—to Jacqueline's point.<br><br>On the other hand, if part of your job is to deal with essential urgent tasks (like a newspaper job with short deadlines, or a emergency room), then, like Mark says in DIT, you need to already have established systems and procedures for dealing with the urgency.  It's an expected part of your day.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br><br>Nice to see you back in the forum - have missed your posts!<br><br>Totally agree with your comments and have also tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to make the same point that as a generality there are usually very few items that really must be done today, although prior to AF many of us, like you felt we ought to do everything.  As I said above, the items we decide we must do are usually decided after considering the consequences and making our decisions on that basis - AF has certainly helped me to look at those consequences more objectively, and to change my approach to certain things as a result. Nevertheless, despite my best efforts there will always be urgent items.    <br><br>And I still don't quite follow Norman's "metaphysical spooks" post! :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine, I think what Norman is saying is what I struggled with personally a number of years ago (and am very embarrassed that I did it to others) - and that's "shoulding all over yourself" and "musterbation" - Albert Ellis terms.  <br><br><a href="http://daphne.palomar.edu/jtagg/should.htm" rel="nofollow">http://daphne.palomar.edu/jtagg/should.htm</a><br><br> It's hard when other people hand you lines - "you HAVE TO go to this funeral" (implied - "or you didn't care about that person") - when you hate funerals and believe in valuing people while they're alive, but even worse when you do it to yourself - "if you're a good mother, you MUST review your son's homework every day - or they will end up digging ditches some day."  Says who?  <br><br>It seems like you have very special circumstances - an obligation of the heart is much more difficult to let go of than just "nice to have's" - and you should commend yourself for taking your responsibilities so seriously.  So by the same token, even if one of us says you "should" do this or that - having no knowledge of your real circumstances - good for you for saying "no, I know what the right thing to do is, and that's what I choose to do."<br><br>Maybe your phrase is not "I will", but  "I freely choose to do this..." or "I would feel better if I..."  I know it's semantics, but it's true that a phrase can change how you perceive things.  <br></div>

<div class="content">I think we all agree that we benefit from using our lists as a buffer between requests for work and the action itself, and that we usually instinctively overrate the urgency of a task.<br><br>The "now or never" tasks are kind of obvious: you do them now or take the consequences, as Norman and others have said.<br><br>The "do today" tasks are less obvious. In DIT, you wrote them in below the line and measured them as signs of disorganisation. But AF has no line.</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Norman,<br><br>I really do deeply respect your wit and intelligence, but I have to say when you posted:<br><br>"You do what you want. Using metaphysical spooks like "must" or "should" is a way of neglecting one's agency or lack of it.<br><br>Psychologically speaking, framing decisions within the context of metaphysical necessity, physical necessity, or moral necessity, is a great way to build resistance to doing something.<br><br>Relax. Everything you must do, you already are. Everything else is anxiety about choices."<br><br>I have NO idea AT ALL what you mean.<br><br>What the hell is a "metaphysical spook"?  "Must" and "Should" are words, first of all.  They stand for concepts.  And those concepts have meaning.  (And, BTW, I kind of wonder why you take many opportunities to bash analysis and thinking.  Clearly you do more than your share of both, much to the benefit of all of us here.)<br><br>What does it mean to "neglect one's agency"?  And why did you not chose a simpler more easily understood way of expressing your thought?<br><br>Yes, I agree that choosing the modality of necessity (see, I can be obtuse as well ;-) is resistance building.  That is one reason I chose "will" over "must".  OTOH, it might be useful to know that something "must" be done (for the sake of setting things up, and then transforming that into a different modality .(there I go again ;-) such as "will", "want", "can", "get to do", "excited about doing", whatever.  That is if one has a problem with resisting a task.  It is clear that some people have no such problem and thrive on doing what they must do.  (Oh I wish I were one of those ;-)<br><br>Finally, I take issue, yet again, with the idea that "must" is a floating concept that does not refer to some standard.  In fact, I don't have everything I "must" have in order to make my wife happy.  I need to do things every day to ensure that outcome.  Neglecting that one area can cause me much misery.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline & Will<br><br>I think I will just give give up and retire gracefully!  <br><br>All I was saying was that (a) scheduled items don't belong in AF (b) AF handles deadlines perfectly (c) AF handles virtually anything and everything we throw at it (d) it is sensible to try to minimise disruptions and any tendency we may have had previously to work to deadline (i.e. at the last minute) (e) we need to recognise that past practices may have left backlogs or issues that need addressing in some way if they impinge upon our discretionery time and (f) that, if we are honest about it, there are very few genuine "must do now" items that will interrupt us from working our lists normally, and that, when they arise, then we should "just do them". <br><br>When my mum has a fall late at night and Dad needs help to pick her up of course I "just do it"!

I am not having a "big issue" with a lot of "shoulds" and "oughts" and "must do"s!    In common parlance "I am so over that!!" :-)  All (?!) I tried to say was that our choices (job choices, future plans, values etc) mean that there are certain things that, as a result of those choices, "must" be done.  If Mike wants to build his deck there are tasks which "must" be done to achieve that.  For you, Jacqueline to go on your trip next year, there are tasks that you "must" do beforehand.  Sure nothing really "must" be done - but if not then you will not fulfill your plans - your choices as it were.<br><br>I am NOT, repeat NOT NOT NOT, saying that those tasks "must be done now".  That would be ridiculous - Jacqueline - you "must" go and fuel you RV ready for trip next year and you "must" DO IT NOW!!!!

A cabbage is still a cabbage even if I decide to call it a carrot and I would be extremely surprised if my stress levels changed as a result of such an exercise!"<br><br>Yes, changing a noun like that will not change much about how you look at the world ... though I guess a read of history has shown the changing of some nouns has altered the way the world worked!  But what we are talking about here is how you respond internally to the "characterization" of an "imperative".  That WILL change as you change the wording.  Think about it ... why would we even have the different works: "must", "ought", "should", "will", "can", "want to","have to",  etc.  All of those "modality operators" state how we FEEL about our responsibility, necessity, or possibility to do something.  They simply MEAN different things.  You learned what they meant at your mothers knee.  She taught you what you now understand by those terms.  Likely, her understanding was much like that of the rest of her (and now your) culture.  (I've often thought that people who are wildly successful or dismal failures are so because of the language they speak.  I'll bet that top CEOs don't feel "must" in as negative a way as most of us.  Likewise, those hostile folk who are  at the bottom rung of society rebelling at everything are probably much more keenly affected by the negative implications of almost any imperative. )<br><br>I agree that we cannot know what your language means to you.  That is the very reason I suggested that you "try on" the terms with something neutral and watch what goes on inside and go by that.  In psychology, the only valid laboratory is the one between your own ears ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>I think your example well illustrates creative uses of analysis.  If we just try to fill in the implied standard by which these imperatives are measured, we can at least understand what we are up against.  It may be that one "must" attend a funeral.  But we might have a different reason for the "must" than those speaking do.  As you say, for them it is about respect for the dead, for us it might be about smooth relations with the living.  In any case I think it is good to understand what is going on and then choose with eyes wide open.  At least then, we can prioritize.  For example, if our boss has an urgent need for us to fly out of town to plug the dike on a big project we have two different standards for two different musts:<br><br>- Must go to funeral to keep my family happy<br>- Must go on trip to keep my job security<br><br>If those two things are scheduled for the same time, we now can choose intelligently.  We can buy an expensive bouquet and have it sent to the funeral with lots of explanation about the need to handle the work obligation and sooth the feathers of our family, perhaps.  Or maybe it is just time to rethink how much we value this particular job.  We won't be moved to  have that kind of internal dialog if we don't clarify our language ;-)</div>

I am quite happy to change "must" - I don't have an issue with the words, but what amuses me, and somewhat frustrates me because I have no idea how I have created the impression, is the fact that everyone seems to think I have an issue with "musts", "shoulds", "oughts", etc.  I really have no idea what I said above to give that impression as I am meaning to convey the same as everyone seems to be trying to convince me of.

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>In addition to "spooks" he also used the term "agency" ... yet another reference to the dismal world of spying ;-)<br><br>I guess you are about done with people bashing you about vocabulary.  LOL ;-)  I'll just end it by saying that words make a difference to us even if we have not thought about how we use them.  It can't be otherwise.  We can NOT think without words.  People can FEEL without words, but without the words they can't understand WHAT they feel.<br><br>You pick up your "mum" without thinking (and certainly without a list) but you do so because of how you FEEL about her and those feelings are encoded in language.  Were you to start using the "wrong" language when you thought about your mum, your feelings would change.<br><br>One of the big contributions of NLP (though it did not invent any of it ... these ideas basically come from Korzybski) is to expose the importance of language to our emotional system.  Korzybski got a lot of mileage out of removing the word "to be" and all of its variants from his language.  It makes for some pretty tricky writing, but it does expose how little we really KNOW about the world once we refuse to comment on "identity".

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Sigh - ok ok , you've got me ..... I did think about "the words" and how I feel about them. <br><br>"Ought" and "Should" to me seem to carry an element of guilt in some way - the sense of failure if not done.  Actually they are words I use rarely now to describe my tasks, because AF has highlighted which of my tasks have those elements attached and I can therefore change them.<br><br>"Will do" to me carries no sense of urgency - almost a "laissez faire" attitude, a someday/maybe feeling.  I will do that .....sometime/never.  (Interesting - hadn't realised that 'til thinking about it - thanks Mike (I think....?))<br><br>"Must" to me doesn't carry any particularly connotations, negative or otherwise - it just "is".  I fully recognise that the affected tasks are that by my choices, but if there is to be any sort of issue then that is at the "choice" level, and not at the resultant "must".  .eg. I have decided to go to the cinema so I "must" leave at ....  I guess, if anything, the use of the word "must" on it's own, is just an abbreviation which is clear to us but not to the person hearing, and perhaps that is what Norman is objecting to.  For example when I say "I must empty the dishwasher" I mean "I must empty the dishwasher beacuse I need to use the clean plates", or when I say "I must complete my tax return by xxx" I mean "I must complete my tax return by xxx because I do not want to incur a penalty" or when I say "I must pay my bills" I mean "I must pay my bills because I do not want to get into arrears"  etc etc.  Of course the earth won't stop spinning if I don't do those things but they are things that "I" must do in order to meet "my" objectives.  So what if my objectives are different to other peoples'?  They are mine, not theirs!  All of our choices come with their own little batch of "musts" attached.  I "chose" to buy a dishwasher - it came with a whole load of little "musts" - it "must" be plumbed in, it "must" be stacked or unstacked regularly to be of any use, it "must" be fed with little dishwasher tabs each time I use it.  By accepting my dishwasher I also have to accept it's "musts".<br><br>Hope that explains my thinking in some way Mike - I suspect (quite strongly) that others somehow carry different connotations to those words than me and perhaps that is where the problem lies ...........<br><br>Always enjoy discussing with you Mike :-)<br>  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Just gotten around to reading the article you recommended on "Shoulding Yourself"  Thanks for that - I noticed it said a lot of what I had posted to Mike above so it is nice to have a psychologist confirm that you are on the right track :-)  <br><br>I do find it interesting how words make a difference - I rarely use "should" and "ought", generally use "will do" for conscious specific decision items, eg I will be going to visit xyz tomorrow, and "must" for those actions arising out of an obligation or need based on my chosen decisions, eg I must go shopping (or else I won't have any food). Such tasks fit happily with my "want to"s in AF and so get done with little or no effort. Works for me! :-)<br><br>I still have to confess to a degree of amusement (or bemusement) regarding the vehemence of exception to my use of the word "must" in those specific circumstances but I guess if I somehow gave the impression that every "must" was to be done "now" that is understandable.<br><br>Thanks again for the article link :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hey Christine, we all go looking for an excuse to debate sometimes.  If we can't find one, we'll make one.  :-)<br><br>I was thinking that dismissing kind of comes into this on some level.  I wonder if someone who feels they have very little "have to's" would tend to dismiss quicker and more easily.  It would be interesting to know what kind of dialog a variety of people tell themselves as they struggle with that question - do I dismiss this thing that I should do or not?<br><br>I think *must's* / have to's can be a good thing to keep someone on track.  For years after I lost the baby weight from having my 21 y.o., (I had put on 60 pounds with him! - eek!) I had a *must* that I had to stay below 125 pounds.  It was pretty easy to maintain that weight because I weighed myself every day and never went up more than a pound or two and would immediately take care of it.  Then a few years after that, when I quit smoking, I told myself it would be okay to gain a bit of weight after quitting because my new *must* was that I keep not smoking.  Unfortunately, I managed to put on 25 pounds in 6 months and it was very hard to get rid of and keep off without that threshold in my mind.   Now I'm wondering how I can get my *must* attitude back... :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacquline,<br><br>Remember that "must" is relative to the standard by which you are measuring it.  To "get your must back" you need only to beef up that standard.  IOW, convince yourself of the importance of dropping the weight, or anything else you want to do.  So make a list of reasons to do it, exaggerate the reasons, multiply them, make them sensory and powerful, and review them frequently.  If they need more work, then do the work to make them stronger.  "Musts" have only as much power as the power of the reason for their existence.</div>

<div class="content">I know Mike, but that's kind of my problem - I don't really have a powerful reason to be at that weight again other than I feel really great and look smoking hot (just kidding).   :-)   I don't have the vanity (or insecurity) that I need to feed at 43 that I did at 23 or 33 - if that makes any sense to a guy.   There's no health issues, nothing compelling to latch on to. <br><br>It's not like my desire to be financially independent, where every time I have to ask for "permission" to have the day off or have to put up with people that annoy me at work or whatever, it just grates on my nerves and sends me running to check my bank balance.  :-)<br></div>

I realised that my initial reluctance to dismiss was primarily linked to a feeling that I would have "failed" by not doing something on my "to do list"  which of course AF isn't anyway :-)<br><br>I have reached what to me is a great position with AF in that I can look objectively at what is on my list and identify pretty quickly if I have an issue with an item and if so what it is.  Looking at my earliest open pages and the two or three items remaining on each is very informative.  Many of the items could have been dismissed (but that would have meant dismissing early, ie leaving other items on the page) but by keeping strictly to the rules they still remain.  My first active page, which is page 23, has three items remaining, 1) Sort photos 2) Find a particular article 3) Contact Dad's ISP about some account issues.  Now I want to sort my photos but it's not the best use of my time at present.  I still want to find the article but it's not important. Contacting Dad's ISP is simple enough but having contacted them about 6 times already and been assured it was resolved is a frustration and therefore carries resistance.  None of those items are urgent and can all be dismissed - next time around it may be that one will stand out - if not they will go, but I can look at them now and see straight away how I feel about them. If I had not had a degree of initial angst about dismissal, or not worked through those feelings, I would probably either have dismissed nothing and forced myself to do, or else dismissed too much and feel like a naughty schoolgirl.<br><br>Mind you I have a strong feeling that once I clear my backlog, my "review dismissed items" task will enable some of the "fun tasks" that rather annoyingly dismissed themselves, to skip back onto my lists and shout "do me" do me" do me"!  Looking forward to that!</div>

<div class="content">Christine, now when I dismiss, I tend to say something more like "nah, that's really not so important now", or "don't worry, you'll get around to it later."  I think I've grown to actually enjoy it... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>(There, I typed it correctly this time ;-)<br><br>If you do not have a compelling reason, is it any wonder that it does not happen?  And why should it?  We are built that way.  We don't do things for no reason.  What kind of survival benefit would there be if we went about doing things for no good reason at all?  No, we are built to act only if we have something to compel us.  Something to threaten us or entice us ... the harder the act, the more threat or enticement we need.  It is so with every organism that lives.<br><br>If you don't have a reason, your only choice is to manufacture one.  Perhaps if you wanted to take up some physical activity ... maybe scuba, or hiking, or tennis, or swimming, or fencing or martial arts or ... whatever, then you'd have a reason to get into shape for that.  But you'd have to really want to do that thing ... at least in proportion to the pain involved in the exercise and diet that would be involved.<br><br>Of course, "smokin' hot" is a good reason too ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I'm going to let that one go without comment Mark and learning!<br><br>Jacob at earlyretirementextreme.com has an interesting formula for change:<br><br>D * V * P > C<br><br>D = dissatisfaction with current state<br>V = vision of the future<br>P = plan<br>C = cost of the change<br><br>According to Jacob, you have to:<br>Increase dissatisfaction with present situation. <br>Strengthen vision of future situation. <br>Build a plan to get from the present to the future. <br>Lower the cost of the plan. <br><br>Here's the whole article:<br><a href="http://earlyretirementextreme.com/2009/05/fou-requirements-for-change.html" rel="nofollow">http://earlyretirementextreme.com/2009/05/fou-requirements-for-change.html</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>ROTFLMAO :-)  Jacob has to be a 5w6, no doubt about it!  Hell, he even included an inequality in his formula! ;-)   Just about all writers on change have come up with the same basic idea ... mostly because it is kind of simple and obvious (conceptually speaking, not in implementation ;-)<br><br>Tony Robbins screamed it in his horse voice ;-) for years and combined it with some of the simpler NLP techniques.  I like the way Robbins put it because he made it less abstract. (and therefore less easy to conceptualize and get lost in procrastination ;-)<br><br>Basically his steps are:<br><br>- Carefully and clearly describe the desired end state.  Use emotional words and do so in all sensory modalities.  (Other writers advise building a multi-sensory image with music, pictures cut from magazines, longish paragraphs describing how you will love having achieved that goal, etc.)  This is: V (vision of the future)<br><br>- Do the same for your current state.  (For your current state build an emotional picture and exaggerate the negative feelings you have about it.)  This is: D (dissatisfaction with current state)<br><br>- List  all of the reasons why you MUST change.  This is again: V (vision of the future), but more concretely identifying the particular reasons.<br><br>- List all of the reasons why you really do NOT want to change ... why it will be hard.  This is: C (cost of the change) looked at from one perspective.<br><br>- List all of the reasons why you really HATE being where you are.  This is again: D (dissatisfaction with current state) but more concretely identifying the particular reasons.<br><br>- List all of the reasons why you really LIKE your current situation.  This is: C (cost of the change) looked at from the opposite perspective.<br><br>- Amplify those reasons which will lead you to change and minimize those which will not, or which hold you back.  This is the NLP aspect of it.<br><br>- List the actions you must take to move you toward the desired state and away from the one you no longer want.  This is P (the plan).  Most writers seem to concentrate on this part and the next.<br><br>- Start taking regular actions as dictated by the above.<br><br>- Take feedback from the result of the actions and use that feedback to change your actions to account for problems.  This last step is often taken for granted by most writers but should really be explicitly included.  Where we often go wrong is by assuming that things will just work out on their own if we put our plan on autopilot.  But even an autopilot takes feedback from the environment, compares it to the planned course, and compensates to change the actual course so as to keep on track with the plan!<br><br>That is it broken down as minutely as I can imagine.  It is the same formula as given by the writer you cite, and many many others ... just defined so minutely that there can be no mistake.  Oh, and don't forget the shouting.  You gotta love that shouting!  ;-)<br><br>In writing this and recalling the various takes on it by others, I'm struck by the range of detail which is included or excluded.  The basic navigation metaphor is:<br><br>- Identify where you are<br>- Identify where you want to go<br>- Draw a line between the two<br>- Follow it.<br><br>It can't get much simpler.  But it can get a whole lot more complex (i.e. detailed ;-)</div>
