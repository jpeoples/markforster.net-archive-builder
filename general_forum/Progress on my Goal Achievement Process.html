<div class="content">Continuing <a href="../general_forum/Lenten Challenge Reports.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2780410</a> [Lenten Challenge Reports]  which was misnamed because it only had one challenge report, and the rest was about process invention.<br><br>The Goal Achievement Process is one of incrementally describing goals, objectives, steps to achieve them, and then acting on these, recording achievements made, and turning the whole into a narrative.  It aims to be very efficient to execute (especially compare to how complex the above sounds), and to achieve all the qualities of [The Perfect To-Do System] as I wrote here:<br><a href="../general_forum/The Perfect To-Do System.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2781964</a> <br><br>Presently, my process is stable, both in terms of definition and execution.  It is working very well for me (though not always) and in fact the goal directing aspect of this is so valuable to my sense of well-being, I don't believe I'll ever go back to any process that doesn't incorporate it.  As for clearly communicating the process, I'm still pondering that question.<br><br>I use the DynaList app to do all the processing, because it is efficient, powerful, cross-platform, and always at hand.  I've thought how I could adapt to many other digital tools, but I have not been able to conceive doing this with paper.  Editing feels too important to the process.<br><br>I feel I need an adjective to precede [why doesn't this spell like proceed?] "GAP" because there's surely many processes out there that aim to achieve goals, but what distinguishes this one?    I haven't found a word I like.</div>

<div class="content">>> As for clearly communicating the process, I'm still pondering that question.<br><br>> I think I've got it! Time to lay it out plainly.<br><br>My latest attempt at drafting it up is looking more like a book chapter than a forum post.  Well I have it written out, but I must make it simpler.  I think it really needs to be nothing more complicated than a couple pictures of my goal tracking document and about 4 paragraphs of explanation.  And then more beyond that just like AutoFocus bears a lot more text than its rule sheet, but I suppose including all that up front will be more confusion.<br><br>In practice it's no more complicated than a very simple scanning algorithm tightly coupled to a very simple (Well, Bullet Journal levels of simplicity) process to define, tackle and track goals.  I just need a good illustration to make it clear.</div>

<div class="content">Done!  1640 words; here's the preamble:<br><br>How to pursue all your goals<br>======================<br><br>I will describe my process below, but after two months experience working and adjusting, I am convinced that what matters is not the precise process, but the mindset the system supports: Think regularly about your goals, why you want them, and how you will get there.  By doing this, you increase the motivation to work on things you care about, and clarity so that your work is more effective.  This system will only be effective in as much as you are interested in changing your life for the better.  It won't help much for keeping things the same.<br><br>This idea came to me about two months ago, and proves to be a gift from God.  I say this because it came to me suddenly in a moment of despair, and has transformed my outlook.  If it only works for me, it's still incredible.<br><br>Prior to this, I had been somewhat successful in sticking to a process of writing tasks and doing tasks, but I didn't feel I was making enough progress on things that mattered.  And when I tried to push myself harder to really work on those things, I became overwhelmed and ended up doing less.<br><br>At the beginning, I recorded some of my thoughts.  (Jordan Peterson's Self Authoring program surely inspired me here.)<br><br>* Overweight, low energy, persistent inflammation issues.  I hope to resolve this by eating better.<br>* Finances are a mess.  Get these in order and improve my outlook.<br>* Software development for business prospects is advancing too slowly.  Get back on track and make concrete advancements.<br>* Social engagement levels since COVID has been awful.  Expand and improve how well and how much I engage with others.<br>* I had been growing in my faith, but I want to put that into action.<br>* My general mood has been low, and felt things weren't going forward.  Lack of motivation often left me engaged in lots of trivial entertainment.  On Mark's "How do you feel?" question score would vary between 2 and 6.<br><br>Following the system has been an unqualified success.  While life still has ups and downs, days when I execute poorly, I find on the whole I am more motivated, healthier, working harder, I am making progress on all the above. As a metric, my "How do I feel?" score now averages about 8.<br><br><br><br>Mark Forster mentioned interest in making this a blog entry.  I'm ready, or I can proceed to posting the next instructions here.</div>

<div class="content">I took approximately 2 weeks off.  It wasn't planned as such.  I merely thought I'd take a break for a weekend, and by Monday my momentum died.  Not that I became entirely idle, but I ceased the process and ceased the great success it was giving me.  <br><br>Why did this happen?  Maybe something about the aphorism "don't tell people what you're doing".  Psychologists say it has a similar effect on your mind as feeling like you have already accomplished the thing, and your desire fades.  Maybe having written up the process I lost the need to prove the process.  Maybe I was overtaxed and needed to relax.  I tried getting back but motivation kept slipping through my fingers.  <br><br>Today I'm running with a theory that my labels need to change.  When you read the same things too often, they lose their vibrancy.  I had labeled each Life Area as a phrase expressing the direction of change I sought.  Today, I rewrote each of them into an eschatological description.  More plainly I state how I want to be, in each area of my life, using present tense.  So in fact each of these statements clash with my present reality, but I believe can be my future reality, and I hope to be motivated to engage with these future objectives.  If nothing else, the pondering I did to rewrite these has reengaged my soul, so I feel ready to do tomorrow.</div>
