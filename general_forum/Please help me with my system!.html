<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-10-8 17:43</div>
<div class="content">I have a system that I'm using currently, but it's not working for me.  I seem to be ok getting the daily tasks done, but after that, well, things aren't going so good.<br><br>I have a 3-ring notebook with all of my tasks in it.  I have a separate page for:  daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly home tasks, and separate pages for each of those for my office tasks.  I also have pages for reminder items, house projects, office projects, errands and home improvement tasks.<br><br>I really want to get all of these lists condensed down to about 4 or 5, but I'm having a heck of a time figuring out how to do it.  What do all of you do with items that need to be done once a week, once a month, or once a year?  How do you incorporate all of those into your notebook?<br><br>This may sound very confusing to you, and I completely understand.  If you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.  I love the concept behind AutoFocus, but I'm having trouble getting started.  Please help!  It would be greatly appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">Melinda,<br><br>Just follow these two steps:<br><br>1. Set up your 43-folders "tickler" file. See<br><br><a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/tickler.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/tickler.html</a> <br><br>for details.  Put all the project sheets and reminders into this system, in the appropriate day or month folders.  Don't forget to consult this file first thing everyday.<br><br>2. Just use AF4.  Follow Mark's instructions at<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/5/preliminary-instructions-for-autofocus-v-4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/5/preliminary-instructions-for-autofocus-v-4.html</a><br><br>and "trust the system" as they say.<br><br>List at least one "next action" task for each active project you are working on. Continue adding items as you think of new things to do. Once you're up and running with your 43f/AF4 system, throw out each page from your previous filing system, unless it's a project list or reminder that you need to refile into the tickler.<br><br>Your life has now been saved. You're welcome!</div>

<div class="content">Ubi - Thanks for your reply.  I have another question now.  When I start this tickler file, I'm assuming that I will always use a separate daily task list, but I'll put anything that's in the tickler file for that day on my AutoFocus list?</div>

<div class="content">The daily task list can be included in the AutoFocus list.  In fact, that's a good list to start your AF4.  Write them in.  After you do one, you copy it to the end, and it will be there for you tomorrow to work on again.<br><br>For your tickler question, yes.  The tickler is for future things.  So if you have a weekly task that's due, put it into AF4, work on it, and put it back into the tickler for next week.  Next week, when that date comes up, you pull it out and put it into AF4 again.<br><br>In case it's not clear, the stuff in AF4 is not all expected to be finished in one day.  It's up to you to choose which get finished as you cycle through the list.  Your regular chores probably should be among those which you do finish same day.</div>

<div class="content">Alan - Based on your reply I have a question.  I have a lot of tasks that have to be done once a week, but not on any particular day of the week.  Would I be better off assigning them a day of the week so I can put them in the tickler file?  If I do that, I can already see a problem if I don't get it done on that day.  What do I do with it then if that happens?  Thanks!<br><br>I am so new to this that I almost need a mentor or something.  I have so many questions!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-8 20:12</div>
<div class="content">There are many possible answers.  My approach is to put them under Sundays, and then have them active in AF4 that week until I do them.  Remember, AutoFocus doesn't tell you to finish something on any day.  It just reminds you it's there and you decide when to do or not do.  If you don't finish it today, the list will still be back tomorrow, unchanged.</div>

<div class="content">Addendum: The tickler file dates are NOT due dates.  They are dates to put the task on your Active list.  Hope that helps!</div>

<div class="content">After working with AF4 for awhile, I've found I clear my backlog around once a week. So if I have a weekly recurring task, instead of putting in the tickler file I just cross it off and put it at the end of the list again. <br><br>Eventually, when that active list becomes the backlog, I circle around and it stands out to me at the right time.<br><br>For recurring tasks longer than a week, I put it in my google calendar as a tickler and check it everyday for new things to add to my list.</div>

<div class="content">Melinda,<br><br>You asked (Alan): <<I have a lot of tasks that have to be done once a week, but not on any particular day of the week. Would I be better off assigning them a day of the week so I can put them in the tickler file? If I do that, I can already see a problem if I don't get it done on that day. What do I do with it then if that happens?>><br><br>I just keep each recurring task (e.g. "mop floors - every 2 weeks" or "water plants - every week") on a separate sheet of paper, and file it on the upcoming day that I think I'll have time to do it.  I also use the same sheet to log the last time it was done.  That way, I can see if my plants are about to die!<br><br>As Alan said, "AF doesn't tell you to finish something on any day."  And the tickler is just a mechanism to bring something forward to be listed, scheduled, or started on a given day, not necessarily completed. The whole idea is to keep track of things without having to think about them.<br><br>The other three tools I didn't mention above are an In tray, Reference files, and a calendar. The In tray is where every (paper) thing goes. You empty your daily folder from the tickler, and put anything else (e.g. mail) into it. At the end of the day, it should be empty (trashed, filed in Ref, or back in tickler). Depending on how much paperwork you're handling, you might also want a Pending tray and/or an Active projects tray/drawer. Anything that really must be done on a given day might be best to put on your calendar, instead of or in addition to the tickler.<br><br>Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="content">Melinda,<br><br>If I understand your plight, it seems to be more about your not consulting your lists rather than the list themselves... am I right?<br><br>If that is the case, beside maybe simplifying your lists a bit, use AF as a reminder to consult your lists.  Better, put in place a PROCEDURE (to become a habit in time) to consult your lists before you start your day.  A daily "review" each morning will do the trick.<br><br>As to simplification, I had two systems in place some time ago.  I had an "EVERY" list which was a single page which had all you describe.   EVERY DAY, EVERY WEEK, EVERY MONTH, and EVERY YEAR sections.  (I posted info about it here that you can find by searching ... I even posted a PDF of it on an associated list ... with a link to it on this site.  Try searching "EVERY DAY" perhaps.)  Basically it was just a reminder, not a lot of information.<br><br>For household chores I used a 3x5 card system which was like the 43-Folders system before there was a 43-Folders system.  It was just color coded reminder cards which were filed by Month and Day (the month cards moved to the day cards each month).  The ones under the Day numbers (1-31) were indeed to be done on those days.  Otherwise, when I got the cards for the month out, I filed them under a day of the week.  If I did not know what day, I just put them under Sunday (I think) and they moved around as necessary.   After the task was done, I moved it back to next month ... and at the end of the day, I moved the ones I had not done to the next (or next appropriate) day.  I also wrote on the card the last time I did the task (in pencil) and each time I deferred it ... so I could see if it was being neglected.<br><br>I suggest you focus on building habits for this kind of thing.  (Well, the frequent ones, anyway ;-)  Another thing you can try is to write the upcoming items in your calendar.  If you use a planner with enough space you can put a task list of things to get done in any period when you do your weekly review.  IOW, if you have a page-a-month setup, write (or attach) a list of goals/tasks/focus areas for that month.  If it is page-a-week, do it for the upcoming week.<br><br>I think what will untangle it for you is do do lots of reviews.  That is how things get lost ... they fall under the table or behind a cabinet (in our minds ;-)  Personally, I do a weekly review on Sunday morning (over coffee with my neighbor who also does that ) and consult my monthly goals and allocate them to next week ... and see where I am slipping.  Then I do TWO reviews a day ... really, I mean it (LOL ;-) but they are very quick.  At the end of every day I set up tomorrow.  I review what is on my lists and allocate them to tomorrow if appropriate.  Then first thing in the morning, I do a quick scan to see if that still makes sense.  It is very quick.  As you can tell, I am not a "pure" AutoFocus person.  I like to block time for big projects and I use AF to fill in time when I'm not working those blocks.<br><br>The other thing to do is separate (by highlighting in someway, perhaps) those things that MUST get done and those things that you'd like to do but the world won't end if they slip a bit.  A good example is "Change the Furnace Filter".  That needs to be done every other month (in my system) but if it slips a few days (or even weeks, or even months ... life as we know it does not end ... but the furnace life may be shortened  ;-)  However, "Take out the Garbage" is much more critical and I have elevated it to a habit so I no longer even think about it.  It is critical because the garbage is only collected twice a week and if I miss a day I have to live with it for four days or so.  If you grossly prioritize your lists that way, it might simplify things.<br><br>AF is great as a continual reminder tool.  The only problem that may crop up is if you get so used to seeing and ignoring a task that you become desensitized to it and it slips without your really grasping that it is slipping.  So that means that you need to use the AF system more strictly, I would think.  IOW, when you see an item THINK about it for a beat or two and let it sink it.  Don't just "scan" so that things fly by.  If you THINK a moment, you'll have to answer some mental questions about why it is there ... STILL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Ok, all of your responses were a great help to me. The tickler file is a great idea.  I already have it going.  I like the idea of keeping a separate sheet for recurring tasks & dating them.  It really helps to know now that AF tasks don't necessarily have to be done today.  The In Tray that gets emptied by the end of the day makes sense too.<br><br>******If I understand your plight, it seems to be more about your not consulting your lists rather than the list themselves... am I right?

This advice is very helpful!  I also had the 3x5 card system that you mention.  I got it out of the Sidetracked Housewives book.  You must have too!  I'm using that same 3x5 system for paying my bills.  Reviews are a great idea.  I agree too that THINKING about the task for a couple of seconds will help make this change too.<br><br>I am so thrilled about all of your responses.  I'm going to read through all of them again, and I"m sure I'll refer back to this again & again.  You guys are great!</div>

<div class="content">Melinda,<br><br>Ubi's suggestion is great.  The other option which I use for certain home related task is simply a calendar instead of a list for some of these tasks.  So for me once a month on a sunday is change air filter, once a year is drain water heater and call termite inspector.  Once a week can be clean house and you can then pull out the list of what these tasks are from your notebook.  As much as I love paper for organizing and lists some things make sense for a calendar. For a calendar I do like outlook and use the recurring feature for these items so I do not need to re-write or input again.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Do you still use your EVERY list and 3X5 cards for routine cleaning, maintenance, etc.?  All this advice has been very helpful to me too.  Thanks all.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-11 5:09</div>
<div class="content">Lisel,<br><br>Yes, I use the EVERY sheet today.  It is nice to have a virtual map of what is going on.  What I put on it has varied over time.  When I was much younger, and was saving to buy a house, and we were living hand to mouth, I had all of our paychecks and bill amounts so I could manage that easily.  I am no longer that place so I have other things on it now.  It is useful to keep track of things like property tax payments, though, as they don't fall on sensible dates.  It is also helpful for things like car registration and passport renewals as they occur on odd dates in odd years and it is hard to keep track ;-)<br><br>I use the 3x5 cards for house chores because timing is not critical but it is helpful to allocate my time evenly.  IOW, shuffling cards around so that I get most of it done in a timely way but responsive to other time pressures.<br><br>I find AF helpful to fill in the gaps between scheduled time.  It is the  most flexible system in that way.  And the 3x5 system for housework is equally flexible.  I suppose that using AF for that application would work as well, but then things would be cleaned less on schedule but more because they were crying out to be cleaned ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I would like to thank everyone again for your help.  I think I'm finally getting this AF system down and I'm finally getting something done besides the daily tasks.  You all rock, including Mark!</div>
