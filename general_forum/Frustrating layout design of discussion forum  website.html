<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-2 0:22</div>
<div class="content">I'm loathe to make a negative comment about a site which has given me so much benefit at no cost whatsoever ... <br><br>However, I was wondering if I'm the only person who finds the website a bit frustrating to use?<br><br>On the one hand, it's clear and simple to get around with no unnecessary gimmicks or confusing graphics - which is great. But on the other hand, every time I go onto the site (the Discussion Forum section or otherwise), I'm faced with a column of text on the left and a column of text on the right, and then what appears to be a column in the middle which is empty. To get to any of the 'content', I have to scroll down a page or two before I get to the content in the left hand column.<br><br>If I click on the different menu 'sections' along the top, I'm faced with the exact same page each time ... unless I scroll down and look at the bottom of the left hand column. When I revisited the site for the first time in a while, I thought it was malfunctioning at first; and if I was a new visitor, I probably wouldn't have bothered to look further (akin to judging a book by its cover).<br><br>Of course, this isn't the end of the world, but I haven't experienced this frustration on any other website (and I've visited a fair number in my time), and it seems in such contrast with the fantastic content within the website itself.<br><br>For the record, I use a regular sized laptop (Dell Latitude D630 if you really wanted to know) and my screen settings are all normal. I've faced the same problem with the site for a good while and I've not had any similar difficulties on any other website.<br><br>Once again - apologies if this has already been discussed previously (I did carry out a brief search in the discussion forum just in case).</div>

<div class="content">I find the 3 column format very invasive in terms of reading actual content from the site (whether blog entries or discussion posts).  I could deal with 1 column on the right and a wider content column.  <br><br>I despise the Twitter status area as it's very slow to load.  I am not fond of the Amazon link either, but would prefer it over the Twitter updates.  <br><br>I use Firefox 3.x, and I don't see any problems seeing the actual desired content at the top of the page where it should be (without the scrolling down you refer to).  What is your browser of choice?<br><br>I don't know how much flexibility Mark has with SquareSpace to layout his site any differently, but this site is still much better than most ad-laden sites.  I just think the actual content should get more width.</div>

<div class="content">The speed issues were already discussed here: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/710019#post711790" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/710019#post711790</a><br><br>Best solution: If you use Firefox, install Adblock Plus, then block the following elements:<br><br><a href="http://img.constantcontact.com/mktg/ctct_allstarprogram/all_star_logo_web.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img.constantcontact.com/mktg/ctct_allstarprogram/all_star_logo_web.gif</a><br><a href="http://img.constantcontact.com/ui/images/visitor/email1_trans.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img.constantcontact.com/ui/images/visitor/email1_trans.gif</a><br><a href="http://twitter.com/javascripts/blogger.js" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.com/javascripts/blogger.js</a><br><a href="http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/AutofocusTM.json?callback=twitterCallback2&count=5" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/AutofocusTM.json?callback=twitterCallback2&count=5</a><br><a href="http://twitter.grader.com/twitterbadge.php?u=autofocustm&s=1" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.grader.com/twitterbadge.php?u=autofocustm&s=1</a><br><a href="http://ws.amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&MarketPlace=GB&ID=V20070822/GB/markforstthet-21/8001/590b9126-ea5d-45d8-b8ef-7f89b7102834" rel="nofollow">http://ws.amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&MarketPlace=GB&ID=V20070822/GB/markforstthet-21/8001/590b9126-ea5d-45d8-b8ef-7f89b7102834</a><br><br>This will speed the site up significantly.<br><br>The layout issue with the middle column dropping to the bottom is probably this: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/674069" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/674069</a><br><br>I posted a solution in that thread, but I guess Mark never got around to implementing it. Anyway I would recommend anyone who still uses IE6 strongly to upgrade, at least to IE8 or better yet to an alternative like Firefox, Chrome or Opera.<br><br>Mark, if you want to fix these issues mentioned in that old thread (IE6 layout glitch and loading middle column before sidebars for speed up), my offer to assist you or do it for you still stands.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you. Yes, it is now apparent this is a web browser issue.<br><br>Unfortunately, I use a work laptop which doesn't grant me administrator rights so I can't switch browser. However, I didn't experience any difficulties as soon as I looked at the site on my wife's laptop (which has IE7 installed).</div>

<div class="content">Neumatist: Well, perhaps we'll get it fixed after all.<br><br>You can use a different browser without being admin, btw. Just download, for example, Firefox Portable: <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" rel="nofollow">http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable</a><br><br>After you unpacked it, you can even run it from an usb drive. You should of course make sure there isn't a policy against portable software at your workplace.</div>

<div class="content">For Firefox, another good add-on is Yarip (Yet Another Remove It Permanently)<br><br>Allows site specific blacklisting of HTML elements with a (fairly) easy to use interface.</div>

<div class="content">I wrote a 4-lines script for the GreaseMonkey extension for Firefox, that addresses these issues.<br>It also enlarges the area for writing new messages, and its font size (maybe I need glasses?)<br><br>If anyone's interested just let me know.<br></div>

<div class="content">Walter:<br><br>How about uploading it to <a href="http://userscripts.org" rel="nofollow">http://userscripts.org</a> to have it available to everyone? Especially if someone has the Greasefire extension installed, he will be offered your script if he comes to this page. Just a suggestion. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>I'll gladly do that, but I'd like to have Mark's approval before. <br><br>It removes the right and left column but only when browsing the forum, leaving the rest of the site as it is (and should be). It really is more comfortable.<br><br>In the meantime, everyone who's interested can post his/her email address, or write to me directly.<br></div>

<div class="content">Ah, it completely removes the left and right column, I didn't gather that from your first description. Well, yes, it is a tricky question. What weights more, the right of Mark to decide the content of his homepage or the right of the individual to browse the web uncluttered and at decent speed. Let's see what he says.<br><br>Though I believe not everyone is hit by the slowdowns, or there would have been a greater fuss about it. It seems to be a few unlucky cases.</div>

<div class="content">It's particularly bad for my iPod Touch by the way. When I load Mark's page, Safari nearly dies. It completely freezes for like 5 to 10 seconds and does not respond to any input. No scrolling, no zooming, no page switching. I don't visit the forum with the touch anymore.<br>(Lack of blocking software).</div>

<div class="content">Now that you mention it... I don't think it improves the speed.<br><br>It only lets me read the messages using the full width of the screen and write in a bigger area, with a bigger font.<br><br>>blush<<br><br>I'll check the source code of the page again, maybe its possible to improve the speed as well.<br></div>

<div class="content">I've also had problems with using my iPod Touch and so don't visit the forum with my touch anymore either.... (but no problems at all w/ my desktop Mac running Safari)</div>
