<div class="content">I've been using one notebook since the beginning, and it's been working for me. However, I wanted to try the multiple-notebook method. So now I have  three notebooks: Work, Home, and Creative (for purely fun projects to do in my actual, spare time). <br><br>Last night, I was feeling good about the advantages multiple notebooks could have, and looking forward to trying this out. But, today, I find myself feeling major resistance to using any of them. I've actually been working without my Work notebook today. I've been doing stuff, but I'm already starting to feel that antsy, out-of-control feeling.  :-D<br><br>A part of me wants to go right back to using one notebook immediately. Another part of me still thinks separate notebooks would have lots of advantages, so I should try to stick with it for at least a while and see if the resistance will fade as I get used to multiple notebooks. <br><br>For those who use separate notebooks, what do you like about it? And, for those who've tried both, which did you choose to go with and why?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Deej, I've tried using more than one notebook but found it too complicated for my needs, so I only use one and this works fine for me. Basically I can do many of my tasks at work, at home or when out and about - I feel the really great advantage of having one notebook only is that items are always fresh in the mind and can be easily moved on mentally by re-phrasing the item or rejecting it, for example. One notebook seems much simpler in my experience so far.</div>

<div class="content">One notebook, but two ends, Work and Personal, ("upside down") works for me, maybe not for other people, but what's important is what works for YOU.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Deej<br><br>I've used one notebook from the beginning and love that everything is mixed together.  I have extracted stuff to separate lists when I have a deadline but even that creates resistance to a degree, even though it may be a necessary method to use from time to time.  I think that is because it removes the "only for as long as I want" element.  You may be able to change tasks, but only within a subset of similar items. If I was in a separate environment where I could only do certain tasks, then I would probably have a separate list, but when I don't need to, that jumble of items somehow creates more of a fun element :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I have a Work book and a Home book. I do this because my Work (like most people's) is totally separate from my Home life: in a different location, with different tools and people available. And I'd prefer to forget about work when I leave the office.<br><br>At home, I mix chore tasks and creative tasks in one book. I can't imagine having separate books being effective... how would I know which book to pick up? I would get stuck in that dilemma, and thus not pick up either. When you use one book for both kinds of task, you scan the list of tasks on a page and let your subconscious mind decide whether now is the right time for chores or creativity.<br><br>Personally I have been surprised how often it chooses to work on a chore instead of a creative act -- but once that decision is made the chore stops feeling like a chore, and becomes quite pleasurable.</div>

<div class="content">You've all made some great points. And I realize that separating the different tasks has sort of taken away that feeling of choice, and created the resistance. <br><br>Yeah, I think I'm going back to one notebook.</div>

<div class="content">I personally use two notebooks, since I've found that my work and home tasks are best kept separated. <br><br>But one thing I really liked about having one list is that it allows AF to manage your context switching for you.<br><br>This is one thing I could never do well with GTD --  I'd have all my tasks organized into different contexts.  And let's say that right now I'm working through my "@Computer" context.  Well, there's enough work in that context to keep me busy for several decades at least.  So how do I know when it's time to switch to "@Calls" or "@Home"?  Well, I need some external prompting.  That usually meant blocking out time on the calendar -- but I always resisted it.   <br><br>And I know why I resisted it.  Let's say I blocked off a couple hours for @Computer.  But I've got a nagging feeling that there's a really important phone call I should be making.  Don't remember what it is, but it's really nagging at me.  So, I ignore my self-assigned time block for @Computer, and switch over to @Calls.  Turns out the call could have waited, but while I'm there, I keep having this nagging feeling that I should be working on some other project -- switch to @Boss or @Home or whatever.  But I can't remember.<br><br>So, I switch again, and realize I *do* have an urgent item I need to discuss with my boss.  So I go into @Boss mode, and while I'm talking with him, go through the rest of the items I've saved up in the @Boss context.<br><br>Meanwhile, my @Computer time block has evaporated, and I've still got tons of work to do in that context.  When am I ever going to do it?<br><br><br>With AF I never had this problem.  Everything is there on the page together.  I may be "at work", but all the personal stuff is standing out.  Maybe that means I should take an extended lunch break to blast through some of those things.  Or maybe it even means I should schedule some time off to focus on my personal stuff.  <br><br>Or maybe I'm working on the computer, but the only thing on the AF list that stands out are the phone calls.  OK, switch to phone call mode, make a phone call or two, and then see where AF guides me next.<br><br>GTD never did a good job of helping me decide when to switch contexts.  But this is an area where AF really shines.</div>

<div class="content">I would use a different notebook for a context in which I were, in a way, "someone else". Only then.<br><br>When I was a student, I had a job - a small one, but nevertheless complicated enough to make some kind of task and time management necessary. On the other hand, I felt that what I was doing there was detached from my life - I did it not out of personal interest, but for the money I needed, I wanted to do it as good as possible (mainly to feel myself good with it), but I definitely didn't want to have tasks that were related to that job in the timer I was using then for my studies, my private life etc. So I bought another (cheaper) calendar/timer only for that job, left it there in the office, and I remember how it was to go there, open the door, open the drawer of the desk, taking the timer out with the feeling: "Now I am The Job."</div>

<div class="content">I prefer and believe it's better to have a single list, but in my case it's proving problematic.<br><br>I find myself in a situation where I work or stay out of my house a lot, so when I'm back, I'm exhausted and I don't even want to open the notebook. That makes me neglect many tasks that can only be performed there.<br><br>Next day at work, going through the list, I realize that most of the tasks can only be done at home, leaving only a few that I can perform at work (I'll call them A/B/C). Many times, I just don't feel that I have to work on any of the three at that specific moment, and know that there are many that I'd rather perform, that are on the next page. A, B and C are not ready for dismissal; I just know for certain that I'll work on them a few hours later.<br><br>This is when I find some distortion. Many of the tasks that are on the next page and would allow me to delay A/B/C just a bit are not there because the home-only tasks are firmly taking their place, and they won't disappear. This leads me to either dismiss A/B/C, or to start working on them even if I don't "feel like to". But if that page would have been full of work-only tasks, there's a big chance that during its life cycle, A B and C would have been completed or started.<br><br>I could easily fix the situation by using two notebooks, but by insisting in using only once, I realize how severely I am neglecting my home-tasks. I knew that I was delaying a lot of stuff, but not on this level. By going through the lists again and again, I realize that there is a huge imbalance between the things that I do out of my house, and inside of it. If I'd use two lists, I would surely ignore the "home" one and be productive on the "work" one. Using only one kind of encourages balance.<br><br>Now, for the system to work I can choose between splitting it in two, and accept that I won't be doing a lot at home, or to keep only one and start distributing my time/energy in a better fashion. Haven't decided yet.<br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I started with a single notebook but have since converted to two.  It would be inaccurate to call them work and home notebooks.  Office and Everywhere comes closer.  I have a small business and am employed by a company.  All the work that I do for the company is either done at my desk there or, at the very least, is launched from there. I determined there was no reason to drag that work with me everywhere, hence I leave the office notebook at the office. Conversely, the other notebook is with me whereever I am, even the office, so that I get things done at lunch and on breaks that would otherwise fill up my evenings and weekends. The symbolism of leaving the office notebook at the office at the end of the workday is, for me, very strong.</div>

<div class="content">I might give the notebooks for Work and Everything Else idea a try. I like the idea of closing my Work notebook and being able to forget work (for the most part) for the day. But will a rebel against using a notebook that only has work-related options (with a few fun things sprinkled throughout)? <br><br>I guess I'll see.</div>

<div class="content">I suppose my 2 notebooks are work and everything else. I want to keep work entirely separate.<br><br>Deej I recommend you give it a try. The everything else book includes family obligations, chores, creative ideas... and you get to choose which kind of task gets your attention.</div>

<div class="content">I resisted going to two books at first, since I liked the auto-context-switching idea.<br><br>But I found I do much better with two separate books -- like Alan said, a Work book and an Everywhere book.<br><br>I guess my work and personal life aren't as integrated as I formerly had thought.  :-)   It's pretty interesting how AF helps you make realizations like that.</div>

<div class="content">I see that for many of you the division is by category: one book for work-related tasks, and the other for personal stuff.<br><br>In my case, it's more about the location, not the type of tasks.<br><br>I do many things that are not related to work from where I work (bank operations, paying bills)... and the opposite. In both my notebooks would be non-work and work related tasks, but a lot of them would be exclusive (I can't take my cat to the vet from my job, for example). I guess many tasks would also be duplicated in both lists.<br><br>Anyway, I'd like to find a way to keep a single list. I like that it gives me a full vision of the things that I have to do, and as I said, let me try to balance the workload.<br></div>

<div class="content">I have the reverse of most people, it seems.  I have "home" and "everything else".  I have them in two halves of the same book.  This is because I kept needing to dismiss home tasks that were dependent on that context.  I just couldn't do them anywhere else.<br><br>So I have a point on my everthing else list to review home list and harvest all the things on there that aren't physical context specific.  This keeps me moving well.  But when I am at home, I simply work through both ends of the notebook - home then everything list.</div>

<div class="content">For me I have to keep my work separate.  I work in  a secure environment, so taking work home is nearly impossible.  Doing personal business from the office is also frowned upon.  Web access is severely restricted and we cannot get to outside email or storage sites (e.g., Evernote).  <br><br>So my work notebook stays at work and everything else goes into my home notebook.  I do carry a pocket size notebook to capture items when the appropriate notebook is not handy and have a task in each to "Review memo pad".<br><br>Works for me.</div>

<div class="content">One barrier to good progress for me is that I get easily distracted by various things of interest. So when I am working I have to consciously limit what topics and tasks are available for my attention.<br><br>I started AF with one notebook, but as you can guess, it distracted me at work by presenting too much variety, including things which couldn't be done until I returned home anyway. Using two notebooks was a great solution because it limits my choices to only the ones appropriate for each context; as a result, I feel more focused and less conflicted.<br><br>As can be seen from some of the other posts in this thread, one notebook versus multiple notebooks may be dictated by personality and style. That kind of adaptability is a wonderful strength of AF.</div>

<div class="content">I have Work and Everything Else.<br>Work is a spiral-bound paper, with the spiral wire on the top.<br>Everything Else is Andreas's very cool digital autofocus.cc.<br>Everything Else is used almost exclusively on weekends, when I have some discretionary time. Weeknights I rarely have enough time to consult my list. <br>What I like about autofocus.cc is that I can use it on my home computer or with my Blackberry when I am not at home.</div>

<div class="content">Several people have mentioned Work and everything else.  I have the opposite.  I run my own business, and can work on it wherever I carry my laptop, which is everywhere.  The result is that work seeps into the rest of my life; in fact, there is no rest of my life.<br><br>This isn't a problem, in the sense that I like my work and don't find doing it anything to be resented.  But it does mean that a whole lot of other Life is displaced.  For example, I have two shelves of books that I would like to read but don't. <br><br>So my distinction now is now between what I can and can't do without being in the office (so excluding talking to employees or customers) or using the computer (so excluding work, but also excluding business planning and administration for the local opera group, home banking, emailing friends, web browsing and so on).   Using the computer is, in effect, lumped in with work, whether it is for recreational purposes or not. This is to make me read more, exercise more, listen to music more, and see friends and family more.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I think in that case it is Mark's point about location rather than type that is relevant.  Like you a lot of my stuff is very PC dependent - what I can do is affected by location in that if it is on my desktop it can only be accessed at home (until I really sort out web access to my home network which I'm not sure I want to do anyway!) whereas if it is on my laptop it is available in other locations.</div>
