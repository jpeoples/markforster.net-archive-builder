<div class="content">Is everything done now?  Once it's all done, what will we do with ourselves?<br><br>I suppose that's why so much off-topic discussion is occurring.  Either everything is done so we're idling away, or everything is not done and we're bypassing that, or posting is one of the things heading towards everything being done, or we're still searching for the relative nirvana.<br><br>Just curious on whether people feel successful.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan B.<br>Yeah, I'm glad to say that I'm actually ahead of schedule.   This forum is  a great site to visit as a break.  It gives me a relief yet it keeps me on point!  I can't think of any other website that wouldn't entice me to fall into cyber black holes. We're all focus on work yet we're also socializing a bit which is very similar to a real life work break. I really like the folks here as break "co-workers".  Also, (and this is a huge factor), it's quite mannerly here.  Many other websites are much less courteous!<br>I've been here since 2006.  Originally I came to learn how to compensate for my disabilities.  Now it has become a source of renewal and pleasure.<br><br>Great question!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Displacement for me too- I'm a bit like a rabbit in the headlights - but this forum gives me hope and a real chuckle sometimes.</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Mark's DIT book and his wonderful blogs and forums really helped me immeasurably!  Before, time management was simply a background process.  After the auto accident, I had NO idea how to learn how to accomdate my new circumstances.  Although I finally forumulated a weekly version of DIT blended with GTD, I still learn or re-learn from the AFx - DWM crowd.  I could never properly express how Mark and his gang helped to restore my confidence in myself and in my possibilities. Thank you all!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content"><<Is everything done now? >><br><br>Such a great question. I have an underlying fear of complacency... of turning into my parents. I love 'em, but man did they piss away some good years. And since cowering to fear is built into my families emotional structure, I know - given the right circumstances - that it could do me in. So I try to be vigilant: therapy, self-help, etc. <br><br>This forum... Tony Robbins... Meditation... Exercise... all attempts to avoid plopping in front of the tv to escape the day. <br><br>To date, I think I'm successful. Though I would like to get back into music.</div>

<div class="content">I'm in your boat then Will. Two things that help me with that are going back to AF4 and remembering the principle of little and often. This principle turns scary big things into little things.</div>

<div class="content">have the opposite fear with my parents - workaholism runs rampant in the family and I don't watch TV - and my friends are all working so I don't want to bug them - so I consider myself successful if I post here. :-)  <br><br>Especially on a day like yesterday and today where we get a surprise snowstorm, the school is closed, it's too windy to do anything outside and I have to wait 24 more hours to get my flooring to acclimate.  I can't do cleaning, organizing and doing little jobs around the house without built-in reward breaks or I'd go postal.  But I did play the piano - that was my greatest achievement.</div>
