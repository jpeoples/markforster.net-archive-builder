<div class="content">I'm curious, for fun, to know what system of Mark's you believe Richard Branson would choose to navigate his day and manage his Virgin Group. He carries a notebook everywhere making lists, and uses phone calendars, phone reminders, and email reminders to navigate his way to every appointment, event, and party.</div>

<div class="content">An interesting exercise, but one that I (often) think misses a critical aspects of one's success: upbringing. We love reading about the tools, systems, etc., of successful people, but rarely ask: What drives them? To answer that question, we'd have to consider family of origin issues. I think this is critical, particularly when we hitch our own systems/tools to someone else, and self-flagellate because we're not getting similar results.</div>

<div class="content">Based on interviews and his writing, my guess would be a form of Autofocus made up of many pages of specific focus. Like Autofocus 4 Revised.</div>

<div class="content">I believe Branson's answer, when asked for a time management tip, said the most important thing you can do is to get regular physical exercise.</div>

<div class="content">I recall hearing that Richard Branson's method for getting the important things done was along the lines of 'Make a list' and then 'Do the List'.  Sounds simple enough eh!</div>
