<div class="content">I reread this bookmarked thread I started a little over a year ago, "Not much more to say".  <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1369286#post1369303" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1369286#post1369303</a><br><br>The principles still hold.  The process, which I thought was different, isn't really all that different after all.  It seems to be working fine.</div>

<div class="content">I tend to agree. The only variation is around what KIND of focus we want from AF and processing rules. I was inspired by Mark's photos which suggested to me that multiple items could "stand out" in one cycle. But that's not new. I quote 2mc from that time: "Flagged Tasks is the only method that silenced the nagging voice that keeps saying, "what pressing task is there on another page that I should be doing while I'm working on this page?"</div>
