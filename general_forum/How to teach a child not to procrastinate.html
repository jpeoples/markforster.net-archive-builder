<div class="content">My 21 y.o. son has been helping me with the renovations on my house and I get him to run errands for me etc.  I was putting a list on the fridge of tasks for him to do that week (he is working a part time job).  I haven't been nagging at all, thinking the shortage of money would give him incentive to work on the house with me.  Consequences, right?  I pay him about 1.5 times per hour (cash) what he makes at his part-time job (taxable) - so in reality, almost double.<br><br>He's moving about an hour away to go to University in the fall.  Yesterday I told him it would probably be best if he moved out August 1st (he has already rented a place where he's going to school) as he wasn't helping me anyway.  His plans were to spend a couple of days a week at his new place (doing what, I don't know - brushing up on his Jon Stewart/Stephen Colbert expertise?) and the remainder helping me.  We agreed that if he didn't put in 25 hours / week minimum working for me, I would take his car away if he couldn't pay me for it in full (he's paid half but doesn't have the money to pay for the whole thing).  <br><br>My concern is that he will end up going to school (and in life) and procrastinate as he's already taken 2 years off after his first year of University.  He also tends to avoid things like paying his cell phone bill or student loan - when he has the money - which makes no sense to me.  Then he avoids them when they call instead of telling them that he's paid it.  He doesn't even open his mail!?!  <br><br>Is this procrastination and avoidance normal?  Is it something most kids just grow out of?  I just worry because I have three brothers like this and these kind of habits have made a mess of their lives (incredibly intelligent but no motivation).<br><br>Is there some way I can get through to him or do I just let him screw up and take the consequences?<br></div>

<div class="content">I too have dealt with this and was told by a professional the sooner in life you make kids deal with the consequences of their actions the better off they will be.  So for instance kids in middle school when the grades don't count for college is a perfect time to let them hand in the paper you told them to edit which they didn't, not bring them the homework you knew they forgot.  Let them get a tardy because they forgot to set their alarm etc.  The hope is when the consequences are real, they will have learned they need to perform.  It is hard as a parent to sit back and watch kids not do what they need to do.  The other reality is that some people are more organized, motivated and driven than others.  <br><br>Best of luck</div>

<div class="content">Hi Guest,<br><br>There's been quite a bit of research done on this whole "teenage brain" area.  Apparently the prefrontal cortex (used in consideration of long term consequences, using logic over emotion, impulse control) doesn't fully develop until about the age of 25.   <br><br>Which leads me to wonder - are there some people where it never fully develops?  Or do they just fall into bad habits?  Can good habits eventually physically change the brain?  And horror of horrors - did I pass on bad brain genetics?!?<br></div>

<div class="content">Yes, good habits CAN physically change the brain, both the limbic system AND the pre-frontal cortex. The brain is enormously plastic (neuroplasticity)  throughout the lifespan, not just prior to age 25 !  At the same time BAD habits can physically change the brain too !  ;o)</div>

<div class="content">The only piece of advice I'll offer is the following.... rarely do cognitive solutions work for emotional problems. And... without knowing the whole score (read: family dynamics, major changes - positive or negative), most advice will prove to be ineffective. <br><br>Parents (er. all of us)  enter the first session of therapy with the hope/fantasy that the "expert" has a quick-fix, one-size-fits-all solution to their dilemma. While it is important to not deflate the fantasy, it is also crucial to educate the client about the age/stage of their child, family dynamics, and the process of therapy.</div>

<div class="content">Bev - having worked in ivory tower psychiatry (and marrying a psychiatrist), I can tell you we know far less than we think we know. You rarely hear "the experts" - when conversing amongst themselves i.e. NOT in front of a camera or funding body - talk about such things with such confidence.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum: I definitely agree with you that cognitive approaches for emotional issues is not a terribly helpful approach ... <br><br>BTW I've met many many psychiatrists and most of them IMHO *didn't* have a clue. I HAVE learned from two who I consider world class experts in their field who know a lot about the brain both theoretically and from working clinically for years, and I know from my own experience that the brain can change, even if one has what others might consider congenital neurological damage. It's not easy work, but it is definitely possible and do-able.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">clarification: I meant I have learned from 2 experts who I consider world-class (neither of them were actually psychiatrists; they had other professional designations but both had delved deeply into neurology).</div>

<div class="content">Norman, perhaps it's selfish of me, but I do want grandchildren some day, so gender reassignment isn't an option right now.  But you got me thinking...I was kind of a wreck until I had him, so I could encourage him to be irresponsible so he can become more responsible.  Nothing like being a single parent to make you grow up and keep you home studying for University!  <br><br>Things went very well yesterday - while at work I operated on my home list under AF6 (my son doing the tasks on my list).  Unfortunately, he only got to one on-notice task (maybe I should prioritize them?), so I had to do one other and dismiss two of them.  And a couple of things he'd been avoiding came home to roost and cost him money he can't afford.  Excellent timing.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Sometimes no amount of talking or reasoning will get through and it'll only be by having to face up to the consequences that he may learn.  It sounds like he is starting to experience that scenario - just don't keep bailing him out (although that is probably easier said than done!!)  Good luck!!!</div>

<div class="content">Many kids are great at dismissing tasks.  It is the doing that is a problem.</div>

<div class="content">Out of interest, does he fix his own car/bike, that sort of thing?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-28 22:04</div>
<div class="content">Yeah smileypete, he's very self-functioning and hasn't asked me for a dime since he started working when he was 13.  He even takes my car in for me when I need work done.  He's very good at work, and has worked 2 jobs in the past.  The problem seems to be where he has to be self-motivating (as a child, I was completely hands off with his homework etc. from the time he was in grade 2, so I don't know what happened in high school - he started to care too much about his job vs. the schoolwork, I think - I finally had to call his work and tell them to quit scheduling him for 30 hours a week).   I think I have to take a page out of the book "It's okay to be the boss" and micro-manage a bit more (when he works for me) than I have been.  <br><br>Christine, I did bail him out, however he will pay me back by working for me.  He has a very strong conscience that way of not asking for or accepting help.  Half the time when we go for lunch/dinner, he pays for me too, so he doesn't have an entitlement outlook like a lot of Gen-Xers.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>Could it be that he's happy to work but doesn't want to go to University?  Nothing wrong with that so long as he really understands the consequences.  He needs to understand that there are times in our lives when the boat sails off and we are either on the boat or on the quay.<br><br>I am by nature a very lazy person.  My parents pushed me to do my exams as a kid and now I am very grateful because I have something to fall back on.  However they also helped and continue to help me a lot.  This has left me with a "someone will sort it out if I leave it long enough attitude".  As you can imagine there are times when this doesn't go down too well with colleagues and friends.  I understand rationally this isn't smart, I understand often a stitch in time saves nine.  I even understand through therapy where this all comes from.  However I still do it a lot.  <br><br>My advice is to stop helping which will be more help in the long run.  As to money a suggestion would be to not pay him but keep the money for a better use that you both agree on eg deposit on first house or paying college fees.</div>
