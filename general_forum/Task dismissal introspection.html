<div class="content">I've had an idea for a while that might be of interest. It's just a simple rule about task dismissal: dismissed tasks need to change in order to get back on a list.<br><br>In GTD terms, if a task isn't being done, the Next Action is probably wrong:<br><br>- I shouldn't do it (no resubmission necessary)<br>- It's no longer the right approach (task becomes the better approach)<br>- Task can't be done at this time (task becomes 'add to calendar')<br>- Task depends on prior action (task becomes the real next action)<br>- I don't want to do it (task becomes 'just get folder out' or is dismissed)<br><br>You get the idea. I like the mild enforced introspection.<br><br>Sorry if this has already been mentioned.</div>

<div class="content">Next Action was a big step forward for me. Fortunately (for me), it's now a habit.<br><br>My colleagues find it annoying, mostly because it forces the introspection you describe. It's easy to agree to a project in principle, and even commit the group. Finding a volunteer to take the next action is the real test, and I insist we do that for a few next actions before letting the group commit to the project as a whole.</div>
