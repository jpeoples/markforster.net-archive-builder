<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Approximately one year ago, I announced that I was publishing a book. I also mentioned a few of Mark's ideas that helped assist my efforts to do so. Since then, I have embarked on a more ambitious project: co-authoring (with my wife) a workbook that guides the reader through various levels of commitment, culminating in marriage (should they so desire). We are also preparing to turn the workbook into an online course, in-person classes and a train-the-trainer model for therapists. <br><br>Once again, some of Mark's ideas have been instrumental in keeping me focused and productive. I continue to apply a 7 day due date to all new, and reentered, tasks. I'm even more rigorous about dismissal. And little and often continues to help me chip away at gargantuan-sized projects.  <br><br>A Request: <br><br>My co-author is collecting research for this project, and has designed a quiz based on Dr. Murray Bowen's Scale of Differentiation. The time commitment is appx 5 minutes, and once completed, you will be provided with a snapshot of where your own relationship strengths and challenges lie. <br><br>The quiz: <a href="http://www.learningtocommit.com/blog/the-commitment-quiz" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.learningtocommit.com/blog/the-commitment-quiz</a><br>The workbook (launching November, 2016): <a href="http://www.learningtocommit.com/second" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.learningtocommit.com/second</a><br><br>Thanks.</div>
