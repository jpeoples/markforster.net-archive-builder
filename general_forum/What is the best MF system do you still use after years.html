<div class="content">I have used tons of systems. GTD for years and of course almost every MF systems from AF1 to FV. The only thing which works for me is AF1 except that I changed / 3 rules <br><br>1) During the day I focus on the last page and sometime read it in reverse. I start from the last item to the beginning and from the beginning to the end. <br><br>2) I highline in green every thing I am waiting from others. It is great to see when I was attending stuff from other for calling them. <br><br>3) Sometime I report some dismiss task (highlined in yellow) on a someday paper list notebook I read once a week during my weekly review. It let live in my system some tasks I dont intend to do in a short time. <br><br> I also use a paper diary for reporting and planning my big rocks with time blocks. <br><br>I love AF1 it is so intuitive. With that system I don't bother asking any question I let the system flow and even drop in it some short notes I mark with a dash - <br><br>This system is elegant and fast for acting. It is much faster and easier than GTD<br><br>I only take a time once a week for updating my projects and deciding what are the most important for me the upcoming week or month. <br><br>AF1 is indeed the best and the easiest I ever tried !<br><br>And you ?</div>

<div class="content">FocusGuy,<br><br>If I could live off a long-list system like Autofocus, I would. The method is solid, but something in me resists working through a system like that. I could never stay motivated to go line by line in a notebook, waiting for something to stand out. I would either get overwhelmed or feel boxed in.<br><br>Another challenge was knowing when to use the list and when not to. Mark seemed to run everything through it, from work to TV time, and that never quite worked for me. I have said this before (maybe it is the therapist in me), but I really believe every productivity system is shaped by the creator’s background. And when those systems stick, they tend to resonate most with people who share a similar itch to scratch. Or maybe there is some projection happening.<br><br>As in, if I time block like Cal Newport, maybe I will become as focused and successful as he is. I have fallen into that trap more than once, especially when I am feeling overwhelmed or anxious. The pull to adopt someone else’s thinking is strong when life feels chaotic.<br><br>That said, there is a lot I am grateful to Mark for. Principles like little and often, trusting intuition, pen and paper, this community, and most of all his mad scientist energy. He was always experimenting with tools and ideas, always searching for better ways to get meaningful things done.</div>

<div class="content">I have had tremendous success with Time Surfing, but I have an extreme emotional attachment to AutoFocus (AF1). It's smooth, crisp, and flows beautifully. The other big systems like FVP or FV have somehow felt a little more ponderous and never clicked in the same way. The hardest part, of course, is embracing dismissal and being okay with that. <br><br>I've spent so much time successfully using Time Surfing, though, that I am not sure if I actually would do well with AF1 now. It makes me really wonder. <br><br>The first system that got me into Mark Forster's works was actually no-list 5/2. I used it to great success, and I still think Mark's no-list systems and philosophy are really powerful. My favorites are 5/2 and NL-FVP. As Mark once put it, I think 5/2 has more drawing power, but NL-FVP fits very smoothly into how I naturally think (which maybe is a bad thing). <br><br>All in all, I think AF1 is perhaps one of the most fun "productivity games" that is out there.</div>

<div class="content">@avrum<br><br>I think you're on to something regarding productivity systems being geared toward someone's personalities (and probably to some extent their profession and work/life experience).<br><br>I also find myself drawn often to Cal Newport's various viewpoints. A part of me tries haplessly to timeblock because I want to model my own life on his -- he is after all very successul in multiple domains. It doesn't help that be speaks with strong conviction (as do most gurus) that their way is the best way.<br><br>Same with David Allen, who is incredibly well-spoken and rapid-fire in his delivery.<br><br>But if I try to be like Newport or Allen, I usually fall short. I'm not an MIT-trained computer scientist, nor am I a seasoned corporate management consultant. Their systems have great takeaways for anybody, but trying to model your own system to theirs often brings a sense of frustration and gnawing imperfection.<br><br>I think that's what has drawn me to Forster's work. He is constantly tinkering and offering multiple (sometimes radically different) systems. But he also has an experimenter's attitude, rather than a guru's attitude. To my knowledge, neither Newport nor Allen have drifted much since they became popular. I've listened to Allen in an audio series that was released before Getting Things Done (the book) was released. It's remarkable how almost nothing he was saying in the 1990s has changed to today. Newport as a young college student has also barely changed to his current content. While never changing for 20+ years like Newport and Allen is admirable in some respects, it also shows a philosophy that is perhaps inflexible and dogmatic.<br><br>I'm not Cal Newport or David Allen, so forcing my brain to think like theirs is perhaps an exercise in futility.</div>

<div class="content">Jacob:<br><br>There's also another thing that might not be that happy for some of us. It is perhaps the case that Newport and Allen's successes are at least in part due to the fact that they *can* be so dogmatically consistent over the course of many years. <br><br>However, that consistency isn't always what people think. If you really dig into Newport of Allen's processes and lives, you'll see that they do quite a bit more experimentation than people will generally think they do, because they generally talk about the results of those experiments rather than "livestreaming" their experiments for the world. This gives a false impression of how dogmatic or inflexible they may be. <br><br>If you get really deep into Allen or Newport's work, you'll notice that they shift certain things over time on the basis of what they've found, and they report on failed experiments every so often. <br><br>I'd say that Allen is perhaps a little more geared towards experimentation than Newport is, but he's also spent more time developing a framework that allows him to absorb his experiments under the same umbrella of GTD. In particular, if you find his interviews with people asking him about new stuff, he's pointed to things that other people have done that he admires, in areas like habit building, which he then talks about as something somewhat independent of the work he's doing. This allows him to continue "adapting" while still essentially "selling" the same product. <br><br>Newport has also talked a lot about how his perspective has changed through his various books. There are specific tools that he tends to find very helpful, but what often shifts is the perspective on their application (see the way he tracks changes in mindset from Depp Work to "A World without Email" and so forth). He's known for Timeblocking, but that's really only a small part of his whole approach to things. One thing he does which I particularly appreciate, is to provide a 4-box framework for categorizing the different ways people may like to approach getting into "Deep Work". Very often people think deep work only means one type of "long undivided attention," but Newport points out that there are a lot of different ways in which people get to that kind of thing. <br><br>I myself often do "time blocking" but on the scale of days and weeks rather than hours, which is the only way I can manage it. That's a type of thing Newport would be "fine" with, but if you just skimmed his work, you'd get the impression that such an approach might not be his cup of tea. <br><br>All of this to say that what people like Newport, Allen, and even Forster have managed to do is find a way to remain doggedly committed to consistency in ways that have netted them gains over time. This is something I've been homing in on recently, despite having seen it pointed out multiple times throughout my life. <br><br>Fundamentally, whether you phrase it as "being okay with being bored" or "being consistent" or whatever, I think it tends to be the case that behind all these systems where people succeed, you tend to find a degree of consistency, and I am beginning to hypothesize that this consistency is exactly the sort of thing that most people are trying to avoid while still achieving success (whatever that may mean to them). Or, put another way, they want to be stimulated and novelly, excitedly engaged all the time, but they want the success that comes only from consistency. <br><br>Forster has talked about this a lot (we're in the midst of the Lenten challenge after all!), but his constant changing of systems can hide the fact that under the hood, Forster himself has been pretty consistent in the way that he has approached his time management systems as well. Forster has seemed to consistently lean into trying to find mechanized, gamified ways of driving action without abandoning the feeling of choice, with a particular emphasis on trying to eliminate conscious "weighing one's choices" or conscious decision making. Or, to put it another way, "can I find a way of making a system to make it feel like the system is driving action instead of making it feel like I am driving action?" Maybe one could call it externalized manifestations of internal motivation. <br><br>If you look throughout Forster's work, I think something like this is a common theme, even though the form has changed a lot. And so even with Forster, there is perhaps more consistency than one might at first believe if you just look at his blog!<br><br>Of course, I think Forster is unique, as you point out, for being so willing to livestream his experiments all the time and publish his notes. That's something that neither Allen nor Newport do to the same degree.</div>

<div class="content">Although my current process is more complex than this, its heart is still the inversion of AF4 I invented the year after its inception.  Abbreviated rules for AF4:<br><br>Write all your things.  Draw a line.  Loop through things above the line until bored of them, Scan once through things below the line.  Repeat until above the line is exhausted, then draw a new line.<br><br>Equivalently expressing my process:<br>Write all your things.  Draw a line.  Scan once through things above the line.

<div class="content">A MF system I come back to again and again is the PTMS or 5/2 how it's also called.<br><br>The techniques from Dreams are always with me. I use them regardless of what other system I currently use.<br><br>I do like DIT a lot.<br><br>But it's not even so much about the particulars of any system. For me it's much more about the principles, things like "little and often" that have a much stronger influence on me.<br><br>If I had to choose one MF system to take with me on the proverbial island, it had to be the PTMS.</div>

<div class="content">Productivity Time Management System, also called 5T or 5/2. It's a no-list method, and probably the "standard" no-list method, since Mark Forster decided to put it into his book.</div>

<div class="content">For some reason I always come back to this system. (I try a lot of systems compulsively):<br><br>- Long list but each start of the day I start on a new page with a date<br>- I write what I want to do today on this new dated page<br>- Go through my historical entries (and calendar) and see what also needs to be considered today. Add it to today if appropriate.<br>- Go through today's entries FVP style.<br><br>This is in essence what I do. There are some other stuff I do (like project notes, standard procedure notes and weeding), but these are secondary to the core above.</div>
