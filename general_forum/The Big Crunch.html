<div class="content">Mark announced DWM on Feb 1, and I dare say a lot of people started in on it the same day, and entered a heap of tasks. So today will be the Big Crunch for them. <br><br>I started on Feb 2, and my Big Crunch is tomorrow. I did have 80+ tasks scheduled for dismissal then, but in the last few days I've chipped it down to 60+. Still, there'll be a holocaust on Wednesday morning - though I'll be doing some last-minute rescuing of tasks even then.<br><br>I'll be interested to see people's experiences.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">I meant to write about this last week.  Honestly I think you ought to spread out the tasks a bit. Dismissing more than 20 in a day is hazardous.</div>

<div class="content">My list runs smaller-than-average, but I do have 5 items (4 from the original dump and 1 re-entry from last week) on the chopping block today.  All of them are "home" items, too - so we'll see what wanders to the forefront of my subconscious this evening after the kid's in bed.</div>

<div class="content">Do  you have 80 tasks at risk for each of the upcoming days?  I'm wondering if there is a bubble on the first day due to dumping into the list and perhaps the upcoming days level off at a lighter level? I think that the way the list works several days past the starting date is more indicative of how it will work in the long run.</div>

<div class="content">I don't get it. If you have 30 days to simply do something on a project, how could you have 80 meaningful tasks left over?<br><br>Dismiss them. Over the last year, I've implemented AF "dismissal rules" in other aspects of my life (clothes, books, other possessions, people, hobbies, ideas etc.) with some interesting results. <br><br>I usually don't like to post other sites here, since I feel this is Mark's house and this forum primarily exists to support his work, but here is one of the most beautiful looking blogs out there, that I like to visit when I think I need to do and have more. I wouldn't be surprised if others have visited it before:<br><br><a href="http://mnmlist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mnmlist.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">I'm glad that my "big crunch" is only a crinkle compared to what some of you have posted!<br><br>But since you posted the question, I have started thinking about my initial burst of tasks that will be coming due next Monday.  Most of them are "wishful thinking" type projects, so I've begun thinking about whether the world would end if I dismissed them for now and let them go until the next time I start thinking "boy, I sure wish I could play piano.  I should start practicing" or whatever that item was.<br><br>Everything that I had on my first entry page that *really* needed to be done has been done, so I don't need to worry about that.  I just need to pare down my immediate projects to the amount I can work on in a week.  Since I still have a week before then, I need to consider what I can add right now, and what's not likely to ever happen.<br><br>Thanks for making me think!</div>

<div class="content">"Dismissing clothes! I like it!"<br><br>I learned a trick on how to do this pretty easily and implemented AF rules. I own more clothes and shoes than any man I know and over the course of the last year I have gotten rid of a lot.<br><br>I learned of a similar technique to process books. I have gotten rid of at least a 1000 over the last year or so. It was painful at first, but each time I got rid of ten or twenty it felt better. I hope to be down to less than 50 texts by the end of the month.<br><br>My technique for people is less concrete, but I have managed to reduce my time on the phone, emailing, and such.</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>My hat is off to you if you got rid of that many books.  Books are like my old friends.  I morn the loss of even one.  Nuts, when I think about it.  So much is available in electronic form these days that very few paper texts need be retained.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, <br><br>Many (most) were hard to depart with, especially difficult to find texts here in the States, texts with marginalia, etc. But I really had to ask myself, why was I keeping this things around when I truly was not longer using them. Sentimentality, unrealistic dreams of finishing "unfinished" projects, etc. <br><br>So I went through a AF type process and determined which were better used elsewhere.<br><br>When I admitted my naive fantasies about the texts they were easier to let go. I no longer have these reminder of projects I feel I must eventually get to lying around. Didn't think getting rid of them would make much of a difference, but it has.<br><br>Not everyone has much tied up in their book collections. But when it comes to getting rid of possessions that are burdensome, the first place to look are those which you having the hardest time letting go. <br><br>FWIW.</div>

<div class="content">I hit the Crunch big time, starting on the 28th. When I transitioned in, I recopied my outstanding AF4 items from January as if I had entered them a month ahead in February. This left items that would have been new on 1/29-1/31with no place to go. I ended up doubling them with 2/1-2/3 items, on the pages that expire 3/1-3/3. <br><br>I'm crunching, working bits, and dismissing, but once I realized what a mess this is, I decided that effective immediately, new items are going on today + 31 days.<br><br>Hoping things smooth out in the next few weeks.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I got rid of LOTS of books several years ago by telling a friend over the phone why I was keeping each one. It didn't take too many times of giving dumb reasons like my friend gave it to me as a gift, I might want to lend it to someone, or I might reread it to figure out that they needed to go. I have only regretted giving one of those books away and these days most books are easily replaced if need be. I also had to let go of the notion of being my friends' personal library. The cool thing about buying digital books (which I try to do when I can't find it on paperbackswap) is there's no guilt about keeping them all!</div>

<div class="content">Re mnmlist.com<br><br>Nice site, but he's aiming to get his books down to half a dozen!!  What a boring life, to have only half a dozen books...<br><br>Over the last few months I've had to get used to living on a much reduced budget, and one of the things that cheers me are my books.  They provide endless hours of entertainment, in various ways.  My house is a tip because of all the piles of books everywhere (I do need to get rid of some of them), but without them, I'd be bored - they provide an inexpensive way of spending my time, and they open up many worlds to me.<br><br><a href="http://mnmlist.com/50-things/" rel="nofollow">http://mnmlist.com/50-things/</a></div>

<div class="content">Annette:<br><br>I think he means keep books in electronic form and clear space to walk by giving away their physical forms. Most titles are now available as ebooks, and many classics can be read directly online. Perhaps he likewise transferred his music collection to an iPod and let the CD's go.<br><br>Of course some books are needed for the beach or the couch (or would a Kindle or iPhone do there too?</div>

<div class="content">Annette,<br><br>Yeah, but one person's X is another person's Y ... if you know what I mean ;-)<br><br>You have to see this not as philosophically but psychologically.  I am also a minimalist.  But I don't "sell" that idea because whether the idea is "good" or not depends on who is evaluating it.  I have a gorgeous wife who is not so much a minimalist.  But she has her thing ... she loves change, excitement, stuffing 20 pounds into a 10 pound bag, etc.  I don't evaluate that as "bad", though it drives me crazy.<br><br>So yeah, I need to get rid of books because I'm a minimalist.  But then again, I love books because that is another part of my personality ... so ... CONFLICT.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I learned a simple trick for reducing things like books, CDs, DVDs, office files, socks, shirts, tennis-balls and general paper work.<br><br>Keep the items in a 'stack' (some sort of ordered arrangement). Each time I use something it gets moved to the top (or end) of the stack. Over time the stack self-sorts so all the active items are near the top and anything on the bottom has been unused (or less-used) over that period.<br><br>So you can safely dispose of the bottom X% of the stack, knowing it is the least-used portion of the inventory. For me X% is usually 50% - but you can adjust that to suit the circumstances.<br><br>After a few cycles through this process - the stack is small and contains only relevent often-used items.<br><br>This has decluttered my life in many ways.<br><br>Respect<br>Paul</div>

<div class="content">I discovered a thing called libraries. <br><br>Often when you donate to libraries, the sell the texts to raise money for their efforts. The texts I had which were not common, I made sure would be put into circulation. <br><br>Fortunately for me, I live in the county with the highest degree of library use in the States.</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>Our local library takes books then puts them out for sale on special racks.  It lost the glow for me when I saw guys from the local book stores scooping them up at $0.50 for sale in their shops at $6.00+</div>

<div class="content">Update on my big crunch:<br><br>This week has been a week of focusing on important projects that had drop dead dates this week, regardless of expiry date. These items fyi are on my DWM sheet and because of the importance and time sensitivity stood out as the items to work on<br><br>This means that many of the tasks that were holdovers from my switch from AF4 to DWM ans were set to expire today did not get done. I ended moving 16 items to the graveyard.<br><br>I feel good about this-- some of these items are certainly important and will probably come back to my list in some fashion or another-- but these are items that I had 30 days to take action on and did not. I of course did take action on lots of tasks that were once set to expire this day. Clearly those tasks deserved to live, but these deserve to die and free up time for me to focus on other tasks.<br><br>Still very happy with the DWM methodology!</div>
