<div class="content">First version:<br><a href="../general_forum/Ocin system.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2786389</a><br><br>Second version:<br><br>Fundamental: Work on MIT everyday between 45-90min until happy with the outcome. This includes weekends. Do not break the chain. Schedule this as the first thing you do in the day.<br><br>Go through your remaining list FV style except for this small change:<br>- If the root task gets re-entered (oldest item on your list), then reenter it with a circled dot.<br>- This task then needs to be worked on with every cycle you go through your list or be deleted or broken down in smaller tasks. [It is basically permanently dotted until you complete it]<br><br>Last step is to clear items you have been procrastinating on.</div>

<div class="content">MIT is the same as before.  Everything else is completely different, unless I misunderstand.  What was your experience with these rules?<br><br>2. Then do everything that absolutely needs to be done today. Be very critical what you consider as a must for today. <br><br>3. Create 4 index cards that includes zombies*, due soon (week or two), background projects list and someday/maybe.<br><br>Personally I liked 1 and 2, but the index card process seemed undercooked.</div>
