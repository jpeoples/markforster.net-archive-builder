<div class="content">1. Take this super-easy 3 minute questionnaire: <a href="http://www.preludecharacteranalysis.com/questionnaire" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.preludecharacteranalysis.com/questionnaire</a><br><br>2. Post your personality type below.<br><br>Knowing what motivates us, and how our personality type tends to approach planning, action, and follow-through, we can better understand why we choose a particular system, or none at all. We can understand the specific behaviors we need a system to address for us, providing balance to our less well-developed functions while reinforcing our high-level ones. <br><br>And who isn't a little curious about our fellow forum members and what makes them tick, if only in a general sense. It can help us understand one another's communication-styles. <br><br>Additionally, if someone with a similar personality style to your own is getting along great with a system, you may find it works for you as well. Likewise, if someone on the opposite end of the spectrum is getting on with a system, you might not waste your time with it. They may be using their high-level Judgement function and be naturally deadline-oriented, structured, punctual and linear as it is, whereas you might be a high-level Perceiver who would rather be flexible, spontaneous, quick, and adaptable; working in bursts; free to do what interests you in the moment, when inspiration strikes, rather than when the clock does. <br><br>You may also find you rarely finish what you start — impulsively flitting from shiny project to shiny project, idea to idea — and may see the need for a flexible system with solid-structure that encourages you to finish. Another personality type may not understand the need for such creative systems or structures and instead prefers a short list, deadlines, objective reasoning and prioritization, and a plow horse-like drive. <br><br>You might make a better race horse.</div>

<div class="content">Random changes to my diet and lifestyle to build up dopamine and testosterone levels have occasionally produced dramatic improvements in my Judging and secondarily, Thinking characteristics. Specifically, I become:<br><br>Judging Characteristics<br><br>✔Decisive<br>✔Controlled<br>✔Good at finishing<br>✔Organized<br>✔Structured<br>Scheduled<br>✔Quick at tasks<br>✔Responsible<br>✔Likes closure<br>✔Makes plans <br><br>Thinking Characteristics<br><br>Logical<br>Objective<br>✔Decides with head<br>✔Wants truth<br>✔Rational<br>Impersonal<br>Critical<br>✔Thick-skinned<br>✔Firm with people<br>Driven by thought <br><br>It's like my brain calms down, my nervous system settles, and I feel relaxed yet alert; less distractible; focused; allowing clear thinking and methodical action to come out of me.</div>

<div class="content">Took the first test and it came back INTP.  Previously I considered myself ISTJ.  Most notably, though some questions had clear answers for me, others were very unclear.  For example, I was strongly inclined towards "both" for questions 12-15, and did not prefer one over the other.</div>

<div class="content">There are lots of versions of this test around the web. I recommend completing a number of them in order to get a clearer feel for your type because results for individual tests vary.</div>

<div class="content">After careful reexamination, it turns out I lean more towards introversion than extraversion. And more towards intuition than sensing. So essentially XNFP.</div>
