<div class="content">Since reading "Do It Tomorrow" a few months ago, and starting my quest (with some success) to improve my sanity, I have become enchanted by the idea of going back to pencil and paper, rather than everything computer-based. I am using a diary (you know, a book type of thing :) ), and it's really working well for me.  I believe there are probably others who are finding the same.  I would be grateful if anyone can point me to some information and resources regarding this process.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve<br><br>I can't point you to any information and resources (apart from your nearest stationery shop ;-)), but I completely agree with you. I have quite deliberately resisted any attempts - or temptations - to put my planning in electronic format and will continue to do so. <br><br>Just to put this into context, my life is entirely run by email, I use Outlook reminders to help remind me of tasks that need to be done at regular intervals (watering house plants, sending info to a publication when the next deadline comes up), things that are easier to be kept track of that way. I spend most of my time on the computer. But all my day-to-day, weekly, monthly and yearly planning is done on paper. I don't think I could do it any other way.<br><br>I also tend to feel quite smug when I'm talking to people on the phone about a meeting date or whatever and they take ages to bring up their diary in their computer and find the right entry etc, while I have got the paper one ready in seconds.<br><br>There are still aspects in life where you can't beat pen and paper. I think Mark also mentioned this in the context of journalling, and I agree with that too. I find the speed of writing by hand is just right to capture your thoughts at the right speed.<br><br>Best wishes - and good luck with improving your sanity. Mark's books (and this website) are definitely a great help on that path!<br><br>Betti</div>

<div class="content">I to use paper for all planning, I find the speed at which I can record things and the portability out weigh the disadvantages of it, such as having everything in one list.  There is too much writing on the fly for me.  I was using the task diary but am now trying a basic notebook.  I do write all of the projects at the beginning and then basically date page each day to create my closed list.  I like the notebook,since I frequently need to take notes in meeting and just pull out the pages to file after I have actioned the items.  The task diary is better for scheduling forward tasks since it is already dated, but I just like to work from one "thing"<br><br>Best of luck</div>

<div class="content">What about writing on a tablet pc or notebook? That has the feel of writing on paper but the advantages of the digital. I have tons of paper notebooks that I would like to put into digital format. The great thing about having things in digital is that you can search through them very quickly and link things together more easily. I love paper notebooks and pencils but I can see advantages and disadvantages of both. When I need reminding of something I put it in my phone because the electronic bleep (for want of a better word) reminds me there is something to be done. I can't do that with a paper notebook.</div>
