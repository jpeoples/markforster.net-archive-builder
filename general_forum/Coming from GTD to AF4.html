<div class="content">Questions:<br><br>1) Where do I put my agendas?<br>2) What about planning? Project - subtask/next action<br>3) Someday/maybees?</div>

<div class="content">1) Use your agenda<br>2) Use your Project notes, but the next action is on the AF4 list<br>3) Put it in a tickler file or leaf it on the closed list untill you review.<br><br>What I added to AF4 is context letters before each item:<br>W=Waiting for. O =Office, H=Home, @ = computer/ Internet, A=agenda, C=call, E=errands, R=read/review, *=anywhere, S=someday maybe.<br><br>R -> refers to files on computer / in folder/ book<br>S -> may end up in a tickler or in a  Someday/maybe list<br>The letters help me skim the AF4 list more quickly on context.</div>

<div class="content">Firstly, welcome to what I believe is a simple life.<br><br> second using files for agendas and someday maybes.  I also use letters to note certain items, however, I find I use mostly three W = Waiting, R = Result ie a goal and A = Action.  This keeps your list clean and full of actions, which I think is preferable.   You then can note actions at intervals to review someday/maybe file etc.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">Crown,<br><br>Try to approach this with a fresh mind.  Don't try to make AF look like GtD.  If it did look like it, then it would BE it.  ;-)<br><br>AF is a way of organizing tasks so that they get done in a timely manner.  It is not heavy in planning and scheduling.  It focuses on presenting tasks to you frequently so that you can decide when the time is right for doing it.<br><br>Since it ignores scheduling and does not speak to calendars, agendas, tickers, projects, filing systems, the proper file folders and labelers, those things are outside of AF proper.  But that does not mean you can't do any of those things in your overall system.</div>

<div class="content">Worked AF4 style all day. Man, this systems rocks! It really works!<br><br>I put non-active-agendas simpliy on the calendar and active ones on the A4-list and dealth with them straight away!<br><br>Someday/Maybe and planning I just stored on the computer in mindmaps and so forth and I felt like it had nothing to do with the action part.<br><br>Important things automatically got more actions to it, and I worked little & often at bigger projects I never do something about before the deadline.<br><br>While GTD is good at organizing, I think it is somewhat outdated as nowadays one can do anything on the computer (context has lost it's meaning), and the problem is procrastination and no sense of accomplishment (as projects can go on practically forever). AF4 let's you do some here, some there without thinking much about it, and you get this sense of moving projects/tasks forward all day long.<br><br>I use MyLifeOrganized as a simple outliner and mark tasks for review or point out the current task (so I know where to begin when I come to my computer again) with simple flags.<br><br>Feel that this system is sort of strange and magical at the same time. Anyhow; as self-employed plus a student is just works. I focus on the list and work the progress and that's it. Little and often, never cramping before the deadline!</div>

<div class="content">Crown,<br><br>I agree with your comment on contexts.  People can work pretty much anywhere.  I also felt contexts were counterproductive, as they added another layer of preplanning and list making which when it comes before actually doing can waste time.  It always made more sense to me to list what I need to accomplish and then say I don't have an internet connection versus write out all the things I could do at the computer and make sure they were on an @ computer list.  I think for me GTD quickly got to the point of diminishing and then negative returns on the time invested to keep it up.  That is not to say there are not some useful practices and tips in GTD.<br><br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">AF4 in its design is simple and straightforward. For this reason and because certain contexts tend to blend in to each other nowadays, I only keep my Sometime maybe items on a separate notebook, for future review. I only add letters of H (home) and O (office) for context. But the AF4 principles remain intact. Nice system!</div>

<div class="content">My Someday/Maybe-list consists of just the highlighted items on dismissed pages. I just keep them, skim them from time to time - this way, the list maintains itself. It can't be simpler.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>I came from context, dropped all because I prefer the simpleness of AF. The last remnant was Someday maybe, you convinced me and I'll keep them on AF4 as well. Thanks for the bump in the "right" direction.</div>

<div class="content">Ties, and AdreasE,<br><br>The one thing about Someday/Maybe lists, though, that seem to work better outside of AF is their ability to "hold" really, really, long-term possibilities. And I use the word "possibility" with strong emphasis.<br><br>For instance, putting "buy yacht" on an AF list seems a little odd. Assuming one isn't a millionaire, that is. Certainly most of us won't "feel ready" to buy the yacht when we get to it on our list, and it will end up highlighted. But now we have "buy yacht" highlights interspersed with other highlights such as "create budget" and "learn Spanish". It seems, to me that highlight AF items DO generate  a useful list. . .  but maybe more of a NOW?/LATER? list, rather than a someday/maybe list.<br><br>A separate someday/maybe list for those really big longshot items (climb Everest!) seems to be helpful to me. It doesn't clutter up the AF list with things I don't really intend on doing now, or might never intend to do. Constantly passing over those items while I am working through AF irks me a bit - I don't know why.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">That was my balance as well. I get your valid point. It certainly helps when reviewing or finding focus on higher goals. <br>Gonna try to keep them on the AF4 list for now and see if it is a success.</div>

<div class="content">I think the someday/maybe list if one of the GTD keepers.  I actually use a file.  There are lots of good ideas people come up with that they may not actually be willing to start on but want to capture and keep in case they get the time or inclination to work on them.  At this point I just use file and toss the paper with the idea in there.  On my calendar I put once a quarter review someday maybe file and I then see if I want to start a project.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">I also use a someday/maybe list, quite a number of tasks dismissed by AF4 are on it and I review this list on a weekly basis (recurring task in AF4).</div>

<div class="content">Ok  I am back at two separate lists. As my AF list is sometimes moving so rapidly the "someday maybe stuff" get's left behind. I still do a weekly review and then i put the Someday stuff on a separate list to see where I stand on these. So I'm back and prefer the AF4 list and  stuff that I'm only considering for the future and that goes on my Somedaymaybe list.</div>
