<div class="content">I'm still confused about what the rules are for tasks that are dismissed when their date has passed. Are these to be treated like the dismissed tasks in AF1-4, in which you highlight them and then think about them, e.g., abandon or rewrite (see the instructions about dismissal in the original AF1 instructions)? Or are you supposed to get rid of them and not re-think or re-write  them (following the Niagara Falls analogy)? That is to say, you missed your chance to act on them, and now they are gone for good.  They can only come back later if they pop in your head on their own.</div>

<div class="content">Gorham:<br><br>Yes, they are dead, deceased, done for, defunct, drowned, down in Davy Jones's locker, and quite definitely departed.</div>

<div class="content">"drowned, down in Davy Jones's locker"<br><br>Mark,<br><br>do you think there is any chance to retrieve them from the bottom of the sea?</div>

<div class="content">Rainer:<br><br>I think you should take the fact that they have lapsed seriously. If there's still a real need to do them then you should carefully examine why you failed to do them in the first place. Only then should you resurrect them.</div>

<div class="content">Okay, Mark, thanks. <br>Again the point is: holding myself accountable.</div>

<div class="content">Rainer:<br><br>Exactly.<br><br>The more dismissal is taken seriously, the better the system will work.</div>
