<div class="content">Has anyone experimented with going BACKWARDS through the pages instead forward - that means, you start on your last page, when nothing more stands out, you go to the page before etc. until you arrive at the first open page, after which you return to the last page?<br><br>I don't propose this as an alternative rule, I simply want to know whether this was tried out by anyone (maybe in the beta test phase) and which difference it makes.<br><br>I was thinking about the fact that the most recent tasks tend to be on the last pages, and that some things get irrelevant with time, etc.<br><br>I was even thinking about testing a more complex rule, for example, to return to the last page every time you dismiss a page while going backwards. What would this mean? Or going back to the end every time you start a new page, and then again working backwards.<br><br>Has anyone TESTED (!) this?</div>

<div class="content">I've done it on a couple of days, and convinced myself that it was an interesting experiment. Looking back, however, I think I *really* did it because there was a difficult task on an early page that I didn't want to deal with that day. Be sure that you're not doing it for similar reasons :)</div>

<div class="content">There are many permutations of this idea you could try.  For example, when moving to a new page, instead of just going to the next page, roll a 6-sided die, and move ahead that many pages.  Or you could count to the next page with "Eenie meenie miney moe, catch Mark Forster by the toe, ..."  Might help mix things up a bit.  <br><br>If that doesn't melt the resistance, you could rip out all the pages from AF, put them in a shoe box, and pull out a random sheet any time you need a new page.  Or, give the stack to your mail carrier, and ask him/her to place a random sheet in your mailbox every day.<br><br>If you're *really* fighting some heavy resistance, you could rip out all your pages, attach each to a helium balloon, and let them all go.  If any of them come back, put them back in your notebook.  Otherwise, consider them dismissed.  You know, along the lines of "If you love something, set it free.  If it comes back, it's really yours.  If it doesn't come back, it was never really yours to begin with."</div>

<div class="content">To get back to the original post -- no, I haven't tried doing that.  I think it would make me dizzy.  <br><br>Also, I don't think I'd feel as confident that I'm reviewing everything regularly enough.  It could take quite some time to get back to the first pages, if you jump to the last page every time you dismiss a page.<br><br>I do like the concept -- it's similar to the filing concept that has been discussed elsewhere on the list (just put the file on the shelf, most recently touched on top).</div>

<div class="content">I am trying it in the moment (since a few days), and it feels actually rather natural to me. The other way I have more the feeling to "hunt" the last pages.<br><br>But it might be because of my current situation; I'm rather in a hurry this week under a deadline.<br><br>I'll report!</div>

<div class="content">Andreas - please let us know how it works out!  These experiments are always interesting -- if nothing else, they often reveal psychological insights about how these systems work.</div>

<div class="content">I promised to report.<br><br>So...<br><br>Simply going in reverse order changes actually nothing. It seemed to be better at first look, because at that time I had some fresh but urgent tasks to do, which where on the last pages, of course, so I started where the action was and got a lot done. But... Soon you're on page 9 again, while things shelve up on page 23, 24... so you either have to jump out of the cycle or work yourself through 8 more pages (backwards) before going back to the last page.<br><br>Therefore (and inspired by Greenchutneys SMALL AF-LIST-concept), I will - from today on - test the following tweek:<br><br>Start on the last CLOSED page. That's the page before the last one. Act on it as usual (skimming for items that stand out etc.). If you leave that page (either by working on at least 1 item or dismissing the page), you go to the page before - that is, backwards. While working, the AF list grows longer by adding new items or follow up items.<br><br>And now the rule: WHENEVER YOU CLOSE A PAGE (and start the next on), YOU JUMP BACK TO THAT FRESHLY CLOSED PAGE. And continue as described above.<br><br>The reasoning behind is: <br><br>- On the newest pages are a lot of items that are not yet ripe (so they won't stand out) plus items that may be urgent - and these one you get managed in time this way.<br><br>- On the older pages are only items left that have had their chance to get done several times, so maybe they end up as irrelevant anyway - no big deal if they get dismissed a bit later. <br><br>- If your current situation is rather hectic, your list will grow faster: Then you return more often to the LCP (last closed page) and keep your head up. When things get normal or calm, you'll have the time to dive deeper into the backlog. This way, the system adapts to your workload by itself and without the necessity (I hope) for additional crutches like index cards etc.<br><br>Again: This is an experiment. I'll report again.</div>

<div class="content">Actually, I've been leaning towards starting on newest page first and moving backwards.  As AndreasE says, the more urgent items are likely to be on the newest pages, so I feel confident I'm not missing anything.  And I move through all the pages, so I don't miss anything overall.  I also sometimes go oldest to newest too.  This is working for me.</div>

<div class="content">I've occasionally started with the last page and gone backwards through the pages.  I've used it when I've not been doing AF for a few days.  But I've not done it as the direct opposite of normal.<br><br>If I have pages 1-10, with 10 as the current active page, I'd start with p10.  When I was done with p10, I'd go backwards to p9.  Then when I'd done enough on p9, I go forwards to p10.<br>After p10, I'd do p9 and then p8.<br><br>So the whole lot would look like:<br>10,9<br>10,9,8<br>10,9,8,7<br>possibly 10,9,8,7,6<br><br>By now I'd be back in the swing of things, so I'd now start going forward again.  I might go back to p1 and go forwards from there, or I might go forwards from p6.</div>

<div class="content">To me this undermines of the strengths of AF. Going through each open page and deciding to act on an item or dimiss it forces me to figure out my resistance.<br><br>Either I can restate the item (often the case) or realize I am just not going to do it, at least not in the near future for whatever reason.<br><br>My first open page today has "set-up printer". I bought a nice, new wireless printer about a month ago. It has been sitting in its box ever since. Either I do something today about it (unbox it?!?!), or I dismiss it and wait until the printer decides to make another appearence on my list again.<br><br>My name is Norman U. and I am procrastinor. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Norman, best wishes with the wireless printer. I bought one last summer and I am ready to check it. I just ordered a wired one and hope to have much better luck with it.</div>
