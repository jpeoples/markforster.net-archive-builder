<div class="content">Does anyone use loose leaf for their task management lists (whichever system you are using). I was wondering about the merits of each. I have each available to me (some very nice Filofax binders and some attractive notebooks). I can see that it can be beneficial to track previous achievements and notebooks can be easier to carry around, however loose leaf allows you to keep it a lot tidier over time and may provide a better use of paper.</div>

<div class="content">Loose leaf let's me be more selective what I bring with me. However it is decidedly messier than a fixed page notebook.</div>

<div class="content">With AF Loof leaf is very easy. But a fixed note book is much better for me. <br>As I am a bit messy, I prefer having all my information collected in one place even if it is not structured because i feel much better with no organised systems. <br><br>Little by little I realize that what ever i try to be organised I am much better when i am not. <br>As you know i am a commercial so I prefer blocs of informations like list of clients, list of tasks to do, list of projects, projects themselves on a computer or a binder in brief global info than precise and focus info for i loose all my intuition and lability. <br><br>If I had a psy i would ask why. The only thing I know is more it is simple best it works. Just dont ask me why.</div>

<div class="content">I suppose this thing about keeping it simple goes back to allowing the system to be intuitive. If it is more complicated that is harder.</div>

<div class="content">Alison et al,<br><br>I am also currently using a loose-leaf system.<br><br>On a previous trip home in the UK I bought a selection of the ADOCs binders and paper.<br><br>Not as good quality as Filofax and others, but good enough for now.<br><br>I've settled on A5 and am using one binder for both work and personal, the latter starting at the back upside down, but the paper inserted the right way up!  I have identical colour dividers (thin, not sure how long they'll last).<br><br>The best paper format for me is squared and blank.  The squared is a better use of the A5 size because the lines are closer together than the feint ruled, 40 vs about 24.<br><br>However, one of my work papers was done on A4 (12 x disc binder slots), but by careful folding, I can keep it in the A5 binder (8 slots).  Yes, i sometimes have to take it out and unfold it, but better to carry round in and store in my work bag.<br><br>I think I would prefer a stronger, leather-type binder cover.<br><br>But I'm still watching tablet/slate developments, an 8.7" size (diagonal actual screen available) would be about the same size as an A5 binder.  7" may just be ok as well, which I'll be able to assess, sort of, when I set up my wife's new Galaxy Tab next week.<br><br>If a tablet/slate comes along with a decent digitiser (e-pen), I'll drop the paper binder and keep all my tasks, notes etc using OneNote or maybe something similar.</div>

<div class="content">I once used a loose leaf set up when doing GTD.  It was fine I just thought the GTD part was too complex.  I have experimented with notebooks with removable pages versus hard bound books.  When I was doing the USGTM I used spiral notebooks or legal pads so I could pull note pages off to file them.  At the moment I am using a hard bound book and keeping lists in them and using a separate legal pad for notes.  I requires some rewriting, but I am enjoying using a hard bound book.  It is a blueline a9 with 192 pages and come with an index and a bunch of labels and tabs if you want to use them<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">The main thing that bothers me about loose-leaf is that the ring mechanism makes the notebook too thick to keep in my pocket.   That's why I like the small Moleskine(sque) journal books.  <br><br>Plus, I'm sure I'd try to "optimize" the loose-leaf notebook, like Mark says, and never get around to working my list.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Let me get this straight: You're stating that, simply because the nature of loose-leaf paper is that it allows for rearranging, your productivity suffered because you spent too much time rearranging? <br><br>What could you possibly be doing with 5-15 pages that would cause you to spend so much time on rearranging them that you would never get around to doing your list? <br><br>Really, I'm stunned! I'm flummoxed! I don't even know how to respond to that. <br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">There is a strange aspect with loose leaf. About a mont ago I tried to use a binder. I made dividers and took some loose leaf to put in the dividers. I made an organization quiet structured (i spoke about it in this forum). The system did not work. First it was huge and impossible to carry with me every where (except taking the leafs) and secont there was a real loose of time to put it up to date. <br><br>After a week i realized that a single pocket notebook could contain easely my AF4R tasks or AF4 with a list of project. And on my office desk it was smaller and easier. <br><br>The question was about my projects. How to treat them, if I could not use a binder, because I needed them when I was in appointments... <br><br>Another problem was to prepare my new organization, for I will soon buy an ipad (when the ipad 2 wil be launched). I noticed many clients use it, they like seeing picture of buildings and i need to follow information about them such as what they are looking for and where. <br>So I decided to cleane my computer and I reorganized it in a way i could easely follow and find what i need and make it easely sync with my future ipad. <br><br>I dont use my binder anymore. It tooks too many place on my desk and i am much better when i dont have too many things on it and stay concentrate on my calls and negotiations. <br><br>Anyway the binder with loose leaf was not a succes for me. But for others it may be. <br><br>But AF4R on my pocket paper notebook is indeed a succes. And it works well with my projects on my mac. Sure it will be easy with the ipad. Then I will see if i can only work on i ipad or not the tactile change a lot about the way of working.</div>

<div class="content">Size shouldn't be any argument, because Levenger (and others) make a loose-leaf "ring" system of very small dimensions – not much different the wire spiral of spiral bound notebooks.<br><br>As far as there being "a real loose of time to put it up to date," I just have to marvel at that statement, to put it politely.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I guess what I like about a loose leaf binder is that I can keep more than my time management lists in there. For example I use one at the moment to list projects for each customer, some basic contact info that I like to have to hand, website sign ins for both myself and things I have set up for customers etc etc. It's one 'go to' place for info. I am thinking of adding my master SF list as well.<br><br>I chose an A5 size and have a hole punch for it so I can create my own designed pages, print them out and punch them for my binder. I was thinking I could design a sheet with two columns for the new version fo SF if I decide to use it.<br><br>I guess I am lucky as I work mainly from home. When I go out and about for business I tend to have a brief case or laptop bag with me so I can easily take my binder.  My home stuff I am keeping seperate at the moment.</div>

<div class="content">Lose-leaf or bound. It's a matter of personal preference and experience.  I grew up with solid bound notebooks with good quality paper, and an excellent fountain pen.<br><br>I never consider using even spiral bound notebooks, much less any lose-leaf. They are too cheap and too disposable with the pages that can be ripped at will.  I don't have the feeling that things written in such a notebook have any importance or permanence. Never learned to use Bic either.  I can use a gel pen when necessary, but my real handwriting can be done only with a fountain pen.  If I can find paper that is decent enough.<br><br>I have been away from Europe for 25 years and never seen a decent notebook in any of the stationery stores on this continent.  Even Moleskine paper is overrated. <br><br>And the recent fad with Levenger ring system?  We had such notebooks in 1960's.  They were used for quick notes; to be discarded sooner than later. And they were called ring-notebooks.</div>

<div class="content">Matt:<br><br><< What could you possibly be doing with 5-15 pages that would cause you to spend so much time on rearranging them that you would never get around to doing your list? >><br><br>Well, that is the problem. It isn't 5-15 pages. because the very nature of a looseleaf book encourages one to complicate things. You have your simple list, then you add pages for notes, then extra project pages, and a "someday maybe" list, and project task lists, and a contact list, and your schedule, and then the binder isn't big enough for all the pages, so you have to weed it. And what do you do with the weeded papers, do you throw them away or do you file them, and if so where? And how often do you need to weed the weeded papers, and shouldn't everything be cross-referenced somehow? And then there's the page dividers, and the flags, and the whole thing needs reorganising, and.....<br><br>I feel exhausted just thinking about it.</div>

<div class="content">Ilse,<br><br>At least your argument is based on preference. That's a totally legitimate argument. I just don't find the "I spend too much time rearranging loose-leaf paper in a binder" or "it's complicated" arguments to carry any weight. And, I think the concerns about size are assuaged by the availability of various products that address those very concerns.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">You don't *have* to, no. But the point is the temptation to complicate is there, which it is to a far lesser extent in a bound notebook. And we only have to look at the "tweaks" people put on this forum to see that our natural tendency is to complicate.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I picked up on something in your first response:<br>> "project task lists"<br><br>I take it, then, that SF3 doesn't have any way to distinguish projects. I think you're going to find that those who are still active in the business world sometimes will have the type of job that requires the juggling of multiple mult-task projects. Those tasks cannot be scattered among "normal" tasks. So, if I surmise correctly, then SF3 will not work for a lot of people.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Maybe you already have a good approach Matt?  <br><br>I think you misread me. All stuff for project X is on page X in the back. If a boss came to ask the status, yes I could tell him at a glance.   This is much better than what I read you to be saying, having all the project stuff scattered across task pages or squeezed in the lines who knows which page it's on. <br><br>Actually I guess you've got it figured out and it works much better than my first impression. <br>Ditto to my approach and your impression.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, <br><br>I think you got confused in my back and forth with Mark about his comments regarding the complexity of loose-leaf pages with which I disagree. He made a comment that with loose-leaf you have all these project pages (which IS what I do - but they are in front not in back like you). Because he stated this as a negative, I surmised then that SF3 did not use project pages. And, if I am correct, then it won't work for me.<br><br>I do 80 - 100 projects a year as a fair market value consultant. Each project has about 20 steps that are the same regardless of the project. Then, as the valuation progresses many tasks specific to the analysis arise. And, I can have as many as 20 projects working simultaneously. Then, I have many outstanding calls to vendors, clients, and research contacts and I have no control over when they call me. I have many interruptions. So, I have to have the project tasks together.<br><br>I not certain that SF3 is going to work in my environment.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I use a looseleaf notebook from Atoma since a couple of weeks. It is quite small, comparable to the Moleskine pocket book, and it is not thicker due to their ring system. I like that format, I can carry it everywhere.  I changed from Moleskine because I need in addition to my master list both project lists and person lists (what do I have to discuss with person X when I get him or her). <br>I agree that there is tendency to make things complicate - but as Alan says, basis it the master list, there you can put in reminders to work on a project or to call a person, and then you can go into the back of the notebook and have everything in place. And that was scattered on various places before I had the ring binder - now I have a place where I can find these things reliably. And that is in my view the big advantage of a looseleaf notebook.<br>Of course, real project management and calender is done anyway on my computer.<br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I take your comment to mean that you either:<br>1– did not keep your tasks in any kind of AF, or<br>2– for each project task, you not only wrote the task, but you also either wrote the project name or the project id with the task.<br><br>I suspect it was #1.<br><br>I do have project documentation. It is a 8.5x11 card  stock printed on both sides. On the front it has project name, client contact info, vendor/contractor contact info, summary of agreement terms, summary of agreement services to value, notes about the arrangement not found in the agreement. On the back it has a place to write down questions to be asked and a place to track where the project is in *broad* terms.<br><br>But, having that doesn't help me see exactly where I am and whet needs to be done today. There's quite a bit of distance between the tracking points in the documentation. Having all related projects on one page meets that need.<br><br>And, I can rarely fit all of my associated project tasks on one page. If I were using a fixed-leaf notebook, I would be faced with either 1) project tasks scattered throughout or 2) project pages separated from one another. Neither is a good solution.<br><br>Note: Not all of my tasks are project tasks. I do have a list of tasks that is operated AF1-style. Project pages are listed first, then the "normal" AF1 list. In the morning I read over all my tasks and flag those that stick out no matter where they appear. These form my initial closed list. <br><br>What I'm doing is not that much different that what you proposed in AF4R. In that system the specialized pages could get full and they could become separated.<br><br>All of this leads back to the argument of loose-leaf paper. I do not see the *horror* of using it. I'm amazed at the claims of the loss of productivity by time spent arranging loose-leaf pages. I haven't seen an argument yet that I am convinced the premises are true much less the conclusion.

<div class="content">I think the real question at hand is whether Matt's situation can be adequately handled with a fixed-leaf notebook.  Matt seems persuaded that he must be able to add and remove pages in order to succeed.  <br><br>In the face of project documentation that starts on one page, then grows to two or three, I can't imagine what a fixed notebook solution would be to keeping project documentation together.  <br><br>Indeed, alphabetical projects, stored in a binder is a great simple approach.

<div class="content">I indeed agree with Mark when he says "I'm simply stating that in my experience a fixed-leaf notebook encourages a simple approach and a loose-leaf notebook encourages a more complicated one. " It's absolutely true. Our natural tendency is to make things complicated. But look at the best businessmen or very famous personalities you will notice that they often have a very simple system. <br><br>From my own experience as a passionate of time management and personal organization I realize that when things are separated and well identified everything is simple and doable. <br>Then projects must be separated from context or AF list, <br><br>then as said MF "As far as managing projects is concerned I had a separate file for each person/organisation/event, which contained all the project documents. I also made a lot of use of standardised forms to keep track of actions taken. If I was managing other people then I would also have lists of what actions were down to which people and by when. In the early days I had a day book in which I recorded notes of all phone calls, but increasingly my contacts used email, so I discontinued this".<br><br>For myself I as I am getting older (I will be 49 on feb  the 14th ) I do things the most simply I can. Project for all as a .page file (on mac) no file management system, autofocus 4 revised or others on a little notebook i can carry everywhere, a good ical diary, a good mail management system (I use apple mail) and that 's all folks. <br><br>Because every system as only one purpous - DO THINGS. So when things are getting complicated i always think that the disaster is not very far away. And loose leaf contributes for me to make things complicated because we always want to make things rational. But they aren't.</div>

<div class="content">I think the issue for many is that PM requires TM skills.  My hardbound notebook has actions that relate to projects and the people involved in them, but obviously can not contain all of the projects steps and information.  I think many people wrestle with the issue of how to blend the two disciplines of PM and TM in the real world.  For me it is having a simple notebook with as much written in one place along with files, which of course contain many project files.<br><br>Regarding the loose leaf, I never really liked LL I did at one point like notebooks like spirals with perforated pages, but now and using a hard back book and it just contains tasks and no notes, this has been better and simpler.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">The question has often been posted in regard to AF and its derivatives:  "Should enter project tasks on my list, or should I just enter 'Project X' on my list?"<br><br>The answer has always been "it depends".<br><br>Sometimes it's enough to just have "Project X" on the list.   When you work on that, you pull out your project card or folder or sheet or OneNote page, and do whatever needs to be done.  <br><br>Sometimes, especially for small urgent tasks that are related to a project, it's also helpful to enter those small urgent tasks directly onto the list to give them extra emphasis.  E.g., "Call Bill RE Project X".    This can replace the "Project X" entry, or be added to the list in addition to the "Project X" entry -- whatever works for you.   <br><br>Some people seem to want to strictly apply GTD's "Next Action" rule, and only put the Next Action on the AF list, keeping everything else separate.  If that works for you, great, but there's no need to make this a strict rule.<br><br>Matt seems to want to make it a rule to keep ALL project tasks in his single master list -- by employing loose-leaf project sheets that he can move around within his overall master list.   I think Alan Baljeu was doing something similar in OneNote.   Personally it sounds pretty interesting and if it works for you, great.   I tried something similar and it didn't work for me, and found myself re-arranging the pages and trying to set it up to work more smoothly without always having to think about it -- the trap that Mark mentioned, which Matt is so "amazed" about.  I like keeping project material more separated so the main list preserves a consistent framework and order so it's fast and easy to process.</div>

I don't think anyone was saying, "Hey everyone, WATCH OUT for those dangerous loose-leaf folders!!"    I myself said, "If it works for you, great!  But for me it can be a distraction."<br><br>Second, this sentiment about the trap of tinkering and optimizing, at the expense of getting things done, has been discussed in great depth and breadth on this site (and others).  It's a common trait of procrastinators.  It can "feel" like work but it's really just another way to avoid doing the work.  If you don't have procrastination tendencies, this probably doesn't make sense to you.   But for many people it's a real problem.<br><br>To use your car analogy:  Let's say someone had a strong tendency to avoid going to the office, for whatever reason -- didn't want to deal with the work, or the stress, or the dysfunction, or whatever.   But he also never really faced these issues head-on, and was an expert at finding ways to AVOID dealing with them, even doing this unconsciously.  <br><br>And let's say the person always had an affinity for working on his car.   To get his job done -- to go to work -- he really just needed a good basic commuter car.   But instead, he got a specialized truck and was always in the habit of customizing it.   Sometimes he would say to himself, "That commute is driving me crazy.  What I really need is a better car stereo -- then the commute would be OK."  So he calls in sick and spends the day shopping for and installing a new car stereo.<br><br>A couple weeks later, he is just ITCHING to get away from his office.  On the way home from a stressful day, he hits a pothole on the highway, and the truck bounces a bit too much.   He decides he really needs some new struts and shocks to deal with the stress of the commute.   So he decides to take a three-day weekend, and spends it tinkering with the car, getting new wheels and larger tires in the process.  <br><br>He never actually takes the time to enjoy the tinkering, and never drives for pleasure.  He uses the truck only for commuting.   But he keeps taking time off, making excuses that he just can't deal with the commute and "needs a break" or "needs this new thing" or "just wants to tweak the timing a little" or whatever.  He's painted his truck a different color at least three times and he's only had it for two years.<br><br>His friends have seen him do this kind of thing for years, and see how it affects both his work and personal life in a negative way, but they can't understand what motivates him.  <br><br>Underneath it all is a set of issues with work, commitment, being unable to finish things, fears, and other irrational behaviors that are hard to articulate and very hard for others to understand.<br><br>He himself secretly envies his friends who just get in their cars and go to work every day, and doesn't know why he himself can't bring himself to settle into such a simple routine. He is too unsettled to do that for too long at one stretch, and finds himself needing "breaks" all the time... which he spends on empty tinkering which he always says is really a kind of work, because it helps his commute and makes his workday easier.   He never admits to taking a vacation -- it's always got to be disguised as work -- so in reality, he is never really focused on his work, and never really UNfocused on it either, never really taking a rest.<br><br>What would true friends do in this case?  Would they deride, or empathize that there is a real problem here that isn't easily solved?<br><br>One of the geniuses of Mark's systems is his clear recognition of some of these (very) common forms of psychological resistance to doing one's work, and finding innovative and EFFECTIVE ways to overcome them.  And not only overcome them, but truly change one's attitudes and behaviors, approaching something like a cure, so one can just be more effective, more purposeful, and more realistic about one's work.<br><br>Perhaps your "amazement" simply demonstrates that you haven't ever needed to deal with those kinds of internal struggles.  Or have dealt with them in other ways.   Or haven't used Mark's systems long enough to realize how well they deal with these issues and help people form better habits.</div>

<div class="content">This has been an amazing discourse.  I have watched as the discussions unfolded.  The whole issue of additional items that can distract from one's focus is so profoundly important.  I am not saying that loose-leaf paper is bad, or whatever.  But the overlying theme of keeping things as simple as possible and minimizing those potential distractions that may keep us from our work.  We all have them....they may be different than your neighbors or friends, but they are there.  What might one thing we all have in common here?  The search for the "perfect" time management system.  Taking a system, tweaking it to make it better....one more addition, one more tweak, one more section, context, page, etc.  And in doing this....what about our work?  We claim that we will get to the work and in a better, more efficient manner once we have that "perfect" system.  <br><br>NO ONE is more guilty of this than I am.  I can't count how many time management systems and approaches I have tried.  Why?  Because my work is overwhelming and I want to become just a little bit better at doing it.  Or is because it is more fun doing a new system than facing that complex project with headaches galore?  A bit of both, I think.<br><br>My biggest problem these days is not only changing systems, but going back and forth from digital approaches to paper.  Doing one...I miss the other.  Everything is becoming digital these days.  At my university, all paper forms have been replaced by websites - one goes to a particular section of a website and complete forms there.  Budget sheets for my grants?  I used to get packets in campus mail every week.  Now I get an email with a website link where I must reconcile my budget sheets online.  Patient records?  All digital now.  So...it seems like it would be best to maintain one's tasks list/projects lists online.  I have tried this -- great websites for GTD and other approaches.  I can access them from anywhere.  I have a Droid X smartphone....yes, I can access my task list in a meeting right from my smartphone.  Completely digital -- no paper.  But something is missing.  I find myself tweaking the website constantly....did this sync correctly?  Why not?  Let's fiddle with it some more.  And meanwhile....work is not getting done.  This is more efficient?  Something else is missing....the simple act of writing something down on paper makes it stick in our minds better than typing it out into a website.  Studies are showing this....more everyday.<br><br>So...I should bring my rambling to a close.  Take home message?  Keep it simple, folks.  And I think paper is the real way to go.<br><br>-David</div>

Tablet like ipad change the way of working. Using your fingers directly to the screen or using future adapted pen may change the mental perception you spoke about. More using digital tool by a certain way increase efficiency in certain kind of job like mine. Digital tool at the beginning were not adapted to human beings. Now little by little the evaluate and are more adaptable to tweak. The real nature on information is moving too. Most of people and l uses note books for task, others for notes, and so on...<br><br>But do you need the information all the time ? Will it still stay up to date for years? <br>For me, certainly not. I often read my olds notebooks were i write notes. There are old fashion and i could throw them away except that i keep them for a kind of nostalgia.<br>Anyway, I am sure I will stop changing of system. May be Superfocus R3 will be the solution. So it is not my real challenge. My real challenge will be to choose between paper or digital and find a way of working which let me concentrate on working. <br><br>It is not easy. Reading this forum and exchanging with others really help me. <br>It is not finished but i am on the way. I now I will find the light one day and be efficient in what I do with a global system of organization which suits to me but not necessarily to others.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter:<br><br><< Of course I love paper for the reason you mentioned. But there is a little incoming revolution. Tablet like ipad change the way of working. >><br><br>Some interesting thoughts in your post. I myself have found that using a Kindle to read a book like War and Peace is actually a more pleasant experience  than reading it on paper. I also like the fact that when I've forgotten who a character is (a frequent happening in War and Peace) I can easily do a search to see where they have previously appeared.<br><br>But strangely, my experience with the Kindle has made me no more inclined to use electronic means to keep my time management list. I don't myself see that there is a conflict between electronic and physical. I have a car, but I still do a lot of walking. I can talk to my daughter in Australia with Skype, but I still look forward to visits. I can look at the pictures in the National Gallery on their website in closer detail than in real life, but I still visit the gallery. I could think of numerous other examples, but the essential point is that they complement each other, rather than exclude each other.</div>

<div class="content">@ Mark <br><br>" I don't myself see that there is a conflict between electronic and physical."<br>"the essential point is that they complement each other, rather than exclude each other".<br><br>I guess you are right. On my own experience I found easy to create my "project" in the meaning of GTD. Ie all what is at least 2 tasks. I try to organize these project digitally and for the moment did not find the good way to do it except a file containing all my documents about each project. <br><br>If anybody has any idea about this I would be very please about it !<br><br>So yes Electronic is helpful to follow and complete these "projects" but for my time management list i love it on paper and more i use now a small 11X17 cm paper note book 192 pages i can carry anywhere in my pocket. Then when i have an idea about a task to do i can throw it immediately for doing it as soon as possible. Fo notes I use a A4 note book I use to work every day. Then When I have to do something I can always look a my notes even if they are uneasy to find sometime.</div>

<div class="content">I wrote that your site slogan implied that project management was on topic here. You replied over several posts that such had nothing to do with time management. I tried to get you to answer about the personal organization aspect, but you insisted that organizing projects was just "a task" that wasn't yours to advise, any more than child rearing.  <br><br>So i inferred the conclusion I wrote.  If you believe otherwise I'd appreciate a positive assertion that might clear up this confusion I have. ( Btw when I speak of project management, I never had in mind large scale budgeting, estimating, coordinating, resource management.  Perhaps that was your assumption?)</div>

<div class="content">There seems to be an immense amount of disagreement on this thread, not helped by the fact that a lot of extraneous elements have been introduced.<br><br>For the record, my view is that I prefer bound notebooks to loose-leaf ones because I believe that loose-leaf notebooks encourage people to complicate time management by trying to combine it with project management. This tends to result in over-management of projects which don't need it and under-management of projects which do.<br><br>My view is that project management is a separate discipline from time management, and that differing projects need differing degrees of management.  <br><br>Project management decides what tasks need doing for a particular project. Time management is then used to get the tasks done. Managing a project in itself requires certain tasks (planning, reviewing, recording, etc) which time management also is used to get done.<br><br>The time management system and the project management system should be independent of each other. In other words any time management system should be able to be used with any project management system.<br><br>Also for the record, I withdraw any of my statements in this thread which may have given the impression to certain people that I think:<br><br>1) that loose-leaf paper has mystical properties of enchantment against which human beings are completely powerless.<br><br>2) that having a separate project management system means that only tasks not in the project management system get processed by the time management system.<br><br>3) that "personal organisation" does not include the organisation of personal projects.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>So to project management....do you still use the approaches that you had discussed some time ago -- in DIT days?  Adding statements to your list like "Project A" in some cases, which would trigger one then to work directly off of the project support files....and in some cases, add specific project tasks to your list like "review recent planning document for Project A"?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Yes, absolutely. I've always said consistently that one should enter tasks at the level which works best for that particular task and that mixing levels, even for the same task, is perfectly ok.<br><br>In view of the recent discussion about the length of task descriptions, these days I'd probably rephrase that last task as:<br><br>"Project A Planning?"</div>

<div class="content">Very good, Mark.  Thanks!  This is what I have been doing with AF4R on my projects.  And thanks for your comments on my digital/paper situation.  It just seems as if EVERYTHING is digital these days....to the point that it is driving this old professor crazy.  Don't get me wrong -- I actively embrace and love technology and gadgets....my laboratories are full of them.

<div class="content">wow, other people who are obsessive about lists and organisaton! The joys of the internet!<br>I whole heartedly agree with Mark, and find that loose leaf requires too much of a "system" to work and as a result I spend more time trying to find the right system than completing the lists or using the lists.  I have tried it many times but always end up reverting to a more organic variety of notebooks, which leave more room for creativity and inspiration somehow... though i know not how.<br>Funny because i came across this site googling for a (fun rather than practical) notebook I saw in a gift shop that had a different page for each type of list (ie places you had lived, boyfriends and pets you had had etc) but reflecting on what I have just written I would probably never use it!  But I never stop trying to find ways of organising thoughts usefully...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jane!  Welcome to the club :-)<br><br>Mark Forster has just released his "Final Version" time management system, so you'll find everyone has shifted over to the new FV forum to discuss it.  You're welcome to join in there.  (I suppose after the excitement tempers (which could be a couple months!) more action will return to the general forum.</div>

<div class="content">Instead of notebooks is anyone using Evernote.  I have it on my computer and Android phone and it works perfect for lists along with keep track of articles, to do , calendar, and a thousand uses to store snipets from articles from the web.  So i basically can carry everything with me on my phone.  No need for notebooks loose leaf or otherwise.<br><br>Lladro</div>

<div class="content">Many use EverNote, include our host, though generally for information other than a todo list. Some here likewise use OneNote for general stuff and for task management. I'm one of those, but I also like a bound paper notebook at home.</div>

<div class="content">After all my hard words about looseleaf books, I found myself using one in the final stages of testing FV (as you can see from the photos of the FV list I posted a while back).<br><br>I found it preferable to a bound book for a number of reasons:<br><br>1) It was easier for removing and filing the old list when I needed to start a new variation.<br><br>2) I could remove finished pages and just have active pages in the folder.<br><br>3) I could get to the end of the list much quicker because i only added blank pages as I needed them.<br><br>4) I only wrote on one side of a page, which made moving through the list very fast.<br><br>I allowed nothing else in the folder - no notes, no project documentation, no schedules,  no nothing - because all the advantages in 1-4 above vanished if I did.</div>

<div class="content">Reading this thread at first, I was mystified by the objection to loose leaf. I definitely prefer loose leaf, because there is all sorts of information that I need to carry around with me in paper form, and I need it to be flexible and not weigh a ton. I had been using a planner-size binder, but recently switched to the solid ring-style system (like the Levenger Circa, or the Myndology -- it's the Staple's Arc system, which is available locally and much more affordable). This works perfectly for me. It's flexible, yet it fits in my bag or briefcase.<br><br>I'm sure that some people would be tempted to tweak and rearrange and whatnot, but I don't personally have a problem with this. Everyone is different. Some dieters cannot have candy around because if it's available, they will lose all control. Others can indulge in one piece, and they're fine.<br><br>I see what Mark means, though, about having the FV list in a separate notebook. On the second day of using FV, I made up a little reporter-style pocket notebook using extra rings I had from my planner setup, and punched some 3x5 cards. For some reason, it helps to have this list in a separate book from the calendar and project support pages and information pages, etc.<br><br>I am quickly getting items crossed off, and will be able to remove cards when they are no longer active. This will make it easier to scan the list and it will keep the booklet down to a reasonable size. I can add pages as needed, of course.<br><br>I do use bound Moleskine-type books for some things, like a journal of books read, and other records I like to keep. But for the stuff I carry around with me, loose leaf is the only way to go.</div>
