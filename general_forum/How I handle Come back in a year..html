<div class="content">First, I ask how far in advance they can book appointments.<br><br>Then, I add to my calendar, on the first date I can call back, "appt, Dr X, 2017-11 + 1yr". That means "On this date, call Dr X, and ask for an appointment." 2017-11 is the last visit. +1yr is how long between visits -- important for insurance.<br><br>I add "get lab forms" if I need tests before the visit, and the lab won't accept ones written now. (The Dr's office usually calls me about the forms a week before -- after I've planned my week.)<br><br>That way, I'm one of the first in the book, and have lots of choice.<br><br>I prefer to say, "Joe, don't plan the meeting for Monday, I have an appointment," than "Joe, please move Monday's meeting. It's the only spot the doctor had."</div>
