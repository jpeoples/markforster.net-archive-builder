<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-10-6 9:13</div>
<div class="content">First of all: I bought the app and am very pleased so far ... nice shot!<br><br>Here come some remarks I would like to throw in into the discussions regarding some (minor) enhancements FP should get:<br><br>= List/Pad title: shows the current page no. This is IMO not needed, for it is stated at the bottom toolbar and reduces the nos. of tasks shown quite a bit. Following the release discussion it appears that further pads/lists will be possible to be added in a future version for a different location/context, if the user needs it. Hence the title issue will most probably be resolved and the name of the pad/list will be shown there instead. The font size of the title and accordingly the view estate for it should be reduced to allow at least 1 or 2 more tasks to be shown per page.<br><br>= Page swiping with the "long page" length user option not activated: to have a more list-like feeling it would be nice to have the option to swipe down/upwards in addition to the current standard left and right mode. Just my 2 cents in that respect.<br><br>= Backlog separation line: nice way of doing that via the hyphen :) Hopefully, from a style point of view the display of a nicer "_______________" will be implemented in the next version. The current one is a little bit "fat" and doesn't fit into the app layout so well. I did read that it is planned that the separation line will most probably be located between the tasks and not as a task entry itself anymore ... great!<br><br>= Moving of tasks: this feature is not needed at all - following the AF4 procedure - and hence I don't miss it. The only point I would raise is ... see the next discussion item for projects ;)<br><br>= Simple implementation of projects: it would be great to have a very simple project grouping functionality as follows:<br><br>A project is nothing else as a normal task entry in the list. Subtasks however are introduced by a single hyphen and followed by the project task, e.g.:<br><br>...<br>Task<br>Project<br>- subtask 1<br>- subtask 2<br>- ...<br>Task<br>Another task<br>...<br><br>It would be very nice, if one could rearrange the subtasks to offer some support of the different project styles, e.g. brainstorming, dependent tasks etc.<br><br>FP should handle these entries as a "group", recognise this fact and act accordingly, i.e., if the project itself is marked for completion (and possibly for replication) all subtasks should be marked as done and eventually be copied to the end of the list too. If all subtasks are marked as completed the project entry itself should reflect that too. If a subtask is marked as done and replicated at the end of the list, the project entry should be preceeding it at the new location too ... etc., I think you get the idea :) ... and the next enhancement step would be to copy only active subtasks ...<br><br>This simple project management feature would be awsome!<br><br>= Tickler functionality: how about adding this feature text-wise? E.g.:<br><br>Task<br>Task to be activated when? <date><br><br>and to have a separate tickler pad/list for review being automatically created, if FP finds such entries, before re-inserting the task in the main pad/list it was created on due date, while being launched! In this context the  "? <date>" postfix should be removed from the entry, for this information is not needed anymore. Furthermore, any task being edited after creation and having the postfix "? <date>" while being saved should be treated accordingly. Last but not least the project feature mentioned above must be kept in mind too for correct handling, i.e. a reference to the project must be carried over and handled correctly ...<br><br>Should be enough food for thoughts for the start.<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="content">Stefano<br><br>I don't think that turning this app into a project management tool is necessarily the way to go (also, brainstorming on the iphone is really not that great :)). AF is more of a task management system - the list is populated with 'active' tasks from various active projects, ie ones that you'll probably look to complete within a short/medium timeframe.<br><br>Having said that, what I've been doing is to simply add a few subtasks under the note functionality - the right arrow then effectively signifies that this action is a project, ie has more than one associated subtasks.  This seems to work well.<br><br>Martin</div>

<div class="content">Sure Martin,<br><br>I would love to see FP to be as simple & lean as possible and IMO it's quite there already.<br><br>Your "less is more" approach is a good (initial) starting point ... I just think that subtasks being displayed on the main view gives the oportunity use AF4 with it's full potential, without having to tap for more information in depth. Sometimes all the project steps can't be recalled immediately and IMO, if one has lots of projects going on, one will always go into the project entry to get the full picture every time, even though no subtasks will be worked on.<br><br>With my proposal one just scannes all the (sub) tasks as usual and the work flow is not interrupted and kept at a minimum - it just feels natural ... :)<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="content">"I don't think that turning this app into a project management tool is necessarily the way to go (also, brainstorming on the iphone is really not that great :))"<br><br>Totally agree with Martin H.  I started to write basically what Martin wrote in the second paragraph but then realized it would be redundant.   As it is, dependent tasks and project notes can be added to the notes.  This would keep things simple and clean.<br><br>Not sure I understand Stefano's technical suggestion of how the tickler could operate.  However, Stafano's desire to see a tickler along with the many others who have requested the same really confirms the need for such an enhancement.   <br><br>Looking forward to the updates!</div>

<div class="content">Jonlat,<br><br>Instead of having a GUI for setting a due date of a task, why not just use plain text while entering the task as proposed and let FP handle the rest? KISS :)<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-6 13:41</div>
<div class="content">Yes, I do that already for tasks which need to be processed or started within a week.  I put a + before the date.  For instance, +10 Clean bathroom means that I need to consider cleaning the bathroom on the 10th of that month.  <br><br>However, a task that does not need attention for a couple weeks or longer ...well AF wouldn't do very well with these.  It would clutter the list as well as break the dismissal rule.  Hence the need for a GUI tickler.  <br><br>Presently I use Toodledo for these ticklers.   It works but then I need to retype into Focuspad what I have already typed into Toodledo (double work).  It also requires another program which could be easily taken care of by one: Focuspad.</div>

<div class="content">Stefano, thanks for your thoughtful review. Here are my responses:<br><br>* The page title is sitting inside of a standard iPhone "navigation bar", whose height and general appearance is standard across all apps. When I was designing the app, I played around with removing the navigation bar or using a custom bar, but it just felt wrong. Furthermore, once I have multiple pads I will need that navigation bar for navigating into and out of the pads.<br><br>* The number in the bottom of the toolbar shows the total number of pages, not the current page, so showing the page number in the navigation bar makes sense. I played with some alternatives but none felt right to me. I agree that the page number is a larger font than idea, but as you surmise I can address this once I have multiple pads, since I will want to show the pad title and page number in that bar.<br><br>* The backlog line is indeed a little fat, as I found that a plainer one did not stand out enough. That said, it could probably stand a little tweaking when I get a chance.<br><br>* I understand why you want sub-projects, but it would not fit into FocusPad's philosophy, which is to be very "flat" and paper-like. The idea is that you only place actionable tasks into a pad and review them often until they get done. You might consider managing the sub-project list outside of FocusPad and then bringing in only those tasks that you can take action on. This is in fact what I do (using TaskPaper on the desktop).<br><br>* Several beta testers asked for a "hot list" or "filtering". That is, the app would provide a way of showing only highlighted tasks for quick review. Your request to just show ticklers is a similar idea. Filtering is something I will consider for a future version, but only if I can find a way to make it feel very intuitive and comfortable.<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">Tickler functionality<br><br>@ Jonlat: maybe I did express myself in a not concise way. With GUI I ment the graphical representation of a button to tap for than having an input option time-wise, e.g. a calendar or a selection wheel ... this is an overkill IMO - having a text convention for due dates is much better and fits in the FP philosophy as such. One could expand your suggestion and code e.g. the following: "? <day>[.<month>[.year]]" to follow the European standard. That's good indeed!<br><br>@ Tony: the Tickler filetering feature you're thinking of would clutter the whole list IMO, if not activated - better would be to automatically transfer future tasks into a separate tickler pad/list and to move back these items on the due date. Hence these items would not break the dismissal rule or clutter the main task pad/list.<br><br>Nos. of pages at the bottom: you're right, but you could change that ...<br><br>Simple project management: my suggestion would not break AF4's philosophy as I do understand it, but maybe I'm wrong here. Even TaskPaper/TodoPaper do use projects ... ;) At the end of the day it's up to you.<br><br>Filtering: that would be fantastic to have!<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="content">Stefano, thanks for your thoughts. I imagine doing ticklers in three phases:<br><br>* Allow user to attach a date to a task, either via tapping or by typing it in. The task would auto-highlight when due.<br><br>* Pop-up notifications when a task is due, via a web server "push".<br><br>* If I ever add filtering, then showing just due tasks (i.e. the auto-highlighted ones) would be an option.<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-7 6:57</div>
<div class="content">About ticklers, I'm afraid I have a quite different - humble- opinion on how it should work.<br>1. Due Date is not the trigger (you can put due date as a text at the end of the task, as suggested, if this is a way to implicitely 'prioritize' tasks)<br>2. the trigger from the tickler is for me: at which date should I start thinking/working on a task (i.e. before due date, if any) so taht I have enough time to work and complete it; e.g. anniversary of my marriage arriving the October 15th, I want to be 'triggered' let's say a week ahead, the 8th of October in order to prepare restaurant/gift/... (I know, this example is stupid, I don't need AF4 to remember such 'life critical' dates, but that was just to explain the idea)<br>3. I don't want to handle two separate lists (one with rregular AF4 taks, one with due date tasks), but apply AF4 as it is, adding the 'triggered' or 'ticklered' tasks when appropriate in the AF4 lists, without having to look in the 'tickler' file<br><br>So, for me (and again IMHO): the feature to add is from a task, the possibility to say: put this task out of my current AF4 list (I don't way to see it anymore until...) and 'triggered' it back to the end of AF4 list at a defined date (or better, after x days / weeks in the 'tickler', which is often easier to set up).<br><br>Thas was my 2 (EURO) cents.<br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-7 7:26</div>
<div class="content">And now my review after a couple of days with AP:<br><br>1. I confirm my first feeling, this tool is very well born; I mean the interface (the layout) is beautifully simple (not simpler) to conform AF4 rules (or any AFx version, by the way)<br>2. the tool is easy to use from a practical stand point, easy to launch, easy to add a new task, easy to 'close/hide' a page, ... (by easy: I mean quick and efficient, no overhead, no pop up of pop up of pop up, no need to drill down in subfolders of folders...)<br>3. nevertheless, I'm quicker on paper to do the same<br>4. however, on paper, I have to use a calendar for tickling; I have to use an Excel file to record time, event if not pure AF4; I don't know for other users of such tools, but I believe very important to be able to track time, as I do for myself and request my collaborators to do, as a good practice because it helps the future in better estimating duration of new tasks; the advantage of IS tool (vs paper) is that it is quite easy to implement such features, without adding extra effort from the user.<br><br>Therefore, what I miss with AP (from AF4 rules - as I understood it- and to really benefit from a IS solution and no longer use paper) is:<br>4.a the tickler way (see previous post)<br>3.b the possibility to be back to the current task (task on which I work) after adding a new task; I guess I need a kind of 'color/blind' trick to hilite the current task<br>3.c again (sorry, I insist), if you do add this 'current hiliting' feature, it is quite easy without changing the layout to add the time tracker: just record date/hour when the task is set up 'current' then record the date/hour whent the task is not longer current, for whatever reason; provide then a specific button to list duration (I beliew it better in the Web version, so that we could export in Excel/CSV files from this web add-on)<br><br>Wrap up:<br>.the current version is not sufficient (for me) to give up paper<br>.with 4a b and c, thewell balanced layout and feature tool will become the better tool I have ever seen on iPhone, combining Tickler/Trigger, TimeTracking and Tasks Management in one unified interface/layout.<br>From my stand point,your tool will become the 'leader'.<br>And .79 cents, it is free, compare to the real added value of the tool (no to say if you add my suggestions).<br><br>Again, IMHO!<br><br>Thanks<br>Pascal</div>

<div class="content">@ Tony:<br><br>You're welcome and I really am looking forward to seeing FP enhanced in future versions ... I'm getting fond of your app :)<br><br>- auto-highlighting of due tasks: nice idea, however, IMO the main list will get cluttered with these simple day-date managed tasks. Let me elaborate from where I'm coming from: my persona/private/home tasks are being handled electronically - for the time being with Things Touch - for I love to use gadgets :) At the office on the other hand I love to use the paper version, for I have to work mainly electronic devices/applications and I like to have a balance here - working all day at the screen is exhausting. With the paper version I do enter tasks with due day-dates only - time-dates go into the calendar. Working the AF4 way I always bump into these tasks just to "dismiss" them until the become active ... having quite a bit of them, they do clutter the list, but I'll stick to it again for balancing reasons. Now back to business: I strongly suggest that date-terminated tasks should be out of sight while working on the main list(s) in FP - one will be much more productive and faster. Either by moving the tasks to a separat pad/list or maybe by "hiding" them from the list view ... Think of it.<br><br>- Pop-up notifications: this feature should be on a very low priority for you to implement. It seems to be trendy to have this functionality in nearly every application nowadays. IMHO pop-up notifications do disrupt the philosophy of AF(4), for an "external" prioritisation is the result, which doesn't come from the AF system as such. Let the user decide without "pressure" ... ;) Just my 0.02<br><br>- Filtering option for due tasks: sounds good to me.<br><br>@ Pascal: I do set the due dates some days/weeks in advance and when I do look at the task in depth - looking at the files - I do realise that I still have some time left for completing the task - that's my way of handling it. It really depends on how you implement the processing of due dates ... ;)<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="content">Stefano and Pascal, thanks for your explanations about the tickler feature. It makes sense to me now. With the multiple pads feature I was planning to provide a way to move a task from one pad to another. I could enhance this feature so you could choose when the task is moved, right now or on a certain date. Voila, ticklers! :-)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-7 13:35</div>
<div class="content">Ben detto Pascale ... ;)<br><br>@ Tony: more food for thoughts re the "long pages" option:<br><br>- hiding of pages: why is the diamond feature still active? IMHO this makes no sense here and hence should not be visible, do you agree?<br><br>- nos. of pages: why does FP still show this information, if there's only one big list/page? This functionality together with the page hiding feature should be hidden in this mode too.<br><br>- scrolling back to the page position viewed after entering a new task: this functionality does work only in the multiple-page workflow, but should be implemented here too, if one taps the big [ + ] button on the top toolbar.<br><br>- the "+" row: should be removed alltogether to free up space for an additional task to be viewed. Espacially due to the fact that tapping anywhere on the list, where no tasks are being displayed, lets one add a task - and this feature is really great and intuitive. So why is FP providing the "+" row at all in this mode? I can follow you regarding the multiple-page workflow though ... ;)<br><br>- [ + ] button on the top toolbar: I would like to suggest to move this button to the bottom toolbar and to leave the upper space for titles/information only. Would be more consistent from my PoV usability-wise, do you agree?<br><br>The more I do use FP the more I like it :)<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-7 13:47</div>
<div class="content">Another shot Tony re the "long pages" option:<br><br>- marking tasks as done: would it make sense to you to enable the swiping for this action? Due to the fact that one can't flick through pages here ;) <br><br>- Action/Todo toolbar: following the lines above you can now remove the done button (not the done & copy button!) and free up more space in this toolbar. Marking tasks as done this way is IMHO very intuitive, like striking through ... Furthermore, you could concentrate the colour picker on one button - if one holds the tap more colours should appear - and free up even more space for arranging the other buttons for better tapping!<br><br>That's it for now.<br><br>Cheers</div>
<h2>Reply by Tony</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-10-7 15:02</div>
<div class="content">Stefano, when using the long pages option, you still have pages that you can flick, mark, etc. Each page scrolls up and down, and then you flick to get to the next page. So some of your suggestions do not make sense.<br><br>Adding a task in long page mode should work just like the short pages mode. Having a + in the top navigation bar is a standard iPhone convention, and I like it because (1) I am not using that space for anything and (2) I can leave the bottom toolbar alone and preserve its clean layout and (3) It is more prominent in the top bar, which is appropriate for such an important action.<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-7 21:01</div>
<div class="content">Apologies if this suggestion lowers the calibre of discussion here, but ever since I read on another thread that someone didn't like the app icon, it has drawn my attention to it too.  Sounds superficial, in fact it IS superficial, but the icon doesn't look as bright and clear as most /all of the others on the iPhone, and these things may have an impact in the competitive environment which is the App Store.  Eg the native Notes and the ToDo by Appigo icons which it sits next to on my home screen, look rather brighter, more defined and more glittery.  By the way I am a fan of Focus Pad, and am using it as my AF list.  I just mention the icon Tony in case there's the chance to brighten it up a little in the next release!  Thanks for your work. All the best with the next phase of development.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-8 7:42</div>
<div class="content">@ Tony: you got me ... ;)<br><br>As detailed out before, I'm currently still using Things Touch as my main private AF4 list and hence didn't input lots of (dummy) tasks into FP. Now I've realised that with the long page option one can key in 21 tasks per page and that if there are more pages, FP indeed does jump back to the position the view was before after having entered a new task ... apologies for not having tried it out in the first instance ;)<br><br>Now my remarks/questions re the long page option:<br><br>- Why do you limit the nos. of tasks on a long page to 21? What is the rational behind it? My first thought was "Wow, the user can either use the multiple-page mode or just one long list, that's great!" But alas, that's not the case. I would like to suggest that you change this, for personally I do not like to be limited to 21 tasks per "long" page - I'm more of a linear type of guy and IMHO it does fit better in the AF(4) philosophy - one big/long list ... Hence, if you would concure, all my previous remarks re this topic would make sense again :)<br><br>- Jumping to the previous view position: your're right, if there are more than 1 pages. However, did you try it out with only one long page? It doesn't work.<br><br>- Task addition button in the top toolbar: I can follow your arguments here. On the other hand plaese consider the following: for typing in a new task the keyboard is displayed at the bottom part of the screen. After having tapped the Done button and if I want to immediately add a new task, in some/most cases I have to reach out to the addition button at the top, which is somehow cumbersome. From an usability PoV it feels more natural to stay (with the thumbs) at the bottom of the screen, for the keyboard will again pop-up there. I know that there's the "+" row - which again IMO shouldn't be there to make space for one more task - but what about the situation, when you're in the middle of the list and you want to add a new task and another one and another one ... ? Just food for thoughts Tony.<br><br>- Followong these lines I would again like to suggest that the bottom toolbar is used for the addition and deletion functionality of FP and to leave the top toolbar for information purposes only.<br><br>I hope that I'm not too much of hard work for you with my remarks/requests ... ;)<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="content">Stefano, thanks again for your feedback. I will note the following feature requests: (1) provide a mode where the tasks are not paginated (2) after adding a task, return to the same scroll position on the page.<br><br>I personally like the + row. It feels good to use and it is easy to hit. When you are adding a task, the + row is right below it, so adding many tasks is easy, just hit the + row instead of Done. (I will be adding this trick to the Tips page shortly).<br><br>I agree that adding multiple tasks via the + button on top is a little awkward, but I still don't want to move the + button to the bottom toolbar, as adding multiple tasks is not a common enough action to warrant it. The bottom toolbar is supposed to be for page-oriented actions.</div>

<div class="content">The more I use the Focuspad the more I like it.  And the more I use it, the more I realize that a tickler* (see note below)  is an absolutely essential enhancement and will save a lot of time.   In fact I have moved this capability up to my number one desired enhancement for Focuspad. With a tickler in Focuspad, the speed of the AF will be so much faster than pen and paper even though input into the Iphone is normally slower than pen and paper.  This happens in 3 ways: <br><br>1.  With a tickler in Focuspad, you will no longer need to have future projects/tasks written down in another application or list (calendar or todo list application with date capability) and then transferred to Autofocus on a particular date.  This will cut down the input of these future tasks/projects by half for it won't need to be inputted twice.  <br>2.  No more need to rewrite/retype reoccurring tasks that only reoccur once a week or once a month.  I have many of these.  <br>3.  Sometimes (for me it happens often) small projects which I have been working on in AF, for whatever reason,  become dormant or non-actionable fo a period of time.  In the present Focuspad or with paper and pen I put this project back into a calendar or external application that would remind me when I need to start working on it  or considering it again.  A tickler in Focuspad would allow me to put the project/tasks with notes into hiding and wouldn't bother me until the tickler date would automatically bring it out again.  This has the extra advantage of keeping some of the notes in Focuspad (for small projects) instead of externally.   <br><br>So I eagerly await this enhancement...  Thanks again Tony for all your work!<br><br>*Note: An internal tickler system in Focuspad hides future tasks or project until the particular date that you designate for it (the date that you want it to show up in your Autofocus list so that you can start moving it forward).  This keeps the Autofocus list clean and unclutter.</div>

<div class="content">Another feature request Tony:<br><br>What about the possibility to let FP hide done tasks from the view (e.g. move/transfer them to a different pad/list) so that one only sees the active items for an uncluttered action list? Maybe you could implement a Logbook pad for keeping these for review, if wished?<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="content">I really like FocusPad.  It's lean and almost perfect, but not quite usable for me.  If it had the ability to move the backlog line to an arbitrary location then I would probably use this.<br><br>A desirable, but perhaps not necessary feature is to allow some way to put items in a tickler.  Even a simple monolithic "Future" list that things could be thrown into and brought back from might be enough.</div>
