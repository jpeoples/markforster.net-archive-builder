<div class="content">I spoke about Jane westman method. <br><br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/2014/10/forward-motion-time-management.html?m=1" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/2014/10/forward-motion-time-management.html?m=1</a><br>This was here <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2449893#post2455741" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2449893#post2455741</a><br><br>One of my friend to whom I have explained her way has found an interesting improovement. <br>He kept the idea of keeping the list on the left page and notes on the right except that when i turns a page he reports only but what is actionnable and what is not goes on a master list on his computer. <br><br>There is no questionning he just does stuff as it goes. <br><br>He told me the method is great for it gives him a real control on his stuff which leads him to succes. <br><br>I wanted to share it with you but not in the FV part for it is is different and experiments. <br><br>Kind regards</div>

<div class="content">So I kept his basic idea but my master list goes by projects on Omnifocus. It is faster and easier and paper gives me a much better control !</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, <br><br>Thanks for checking out the blog.  Here is a direct link to the Jane Wesman Article as the link seems to point to another system I developed called Forward Motion Time Management.  Not sure which one you modified.  Thanks<br><br><a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html</a><br><br>Edit - I see your other post and see that you in fact seemed to create a system using both methods.  <br><br>As an update at the beginning of 2016 I reverted to a bound single notebook for all notes to dos etc.  Once again I realize after just two weeks this method is a mistake for me.  Too much page flipping and clutter. The notes get old fast and since they are not grouped the progression of issues and ideas is hard to follow.  <br><br>I will be reverting to Forward Motion.  Notes will be taken on a legal pad and filed away from To Dos.<br><br>I hope everyone has a happy and productive 2016.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Gerry ! I made a mistake the link was wrong about JW méthod. I like her system except that I think that it is better to separate tanks on one note book and notes on another even a binder if they are written. That's what she does "she takes extensive notes in folders" and use the note's page only for shot notes.</div>
