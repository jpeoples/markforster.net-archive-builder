<div class="content">Why do you have us highlight tasks that are dismissed?  You say its so we can review them, but when does that happen?  Why?<br><br>If there's no review, then it seems that putting an X at the top of the page would be enough.</div>

<div class="content">When does the review happen? When you feel it's necessary. <br><br>If you want to, you can put a task on the list called "Review dismissed items".</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I excited to start using your new system, but I want to understand every tiny detail before I start.<br><br>Why is there the extra step of highlighting dismissed items? Wouldn't I be able to easily identify the dismissed items by the fact that they're the items remaining on a non-active page that haven't been crossed off?</div>

<div class="content">At the risk of sounding curt, I think there are many folks coming up with issues that will be addressed once they've committed themselves to working the system and making it work. <br><br>My desire for "Understanding every tiny detail" has kept me from making inestimable progress in life...</div>

<div class="content">Fair call, Mark in Texas. Since I posted my comment, I've started recording my tasks into the new system, and started working my way through the list.<br><br>I'll give it a go without highlighting the dismissed items, and see if I run into any problems.<br><br>I posted my question because I wanted confirmation that the system worked without it, or whether I had misunderstood the 'dismissing' process.</div>

<div class="content">Simon:<br><br>You speak about "this extra step" as if it were some onerous burden. It really doesn't take very long to highlight an item.<br><br>When you have filled your notebook with crossed off items you will find that it will take you a heck of a long time to spot which items are uncrossed off out of literally thousands of items.<br><br>If you highlight them (or mark them in some other easily identifiable way) you can page through and see them immediately.</div>

<div class="content">As a general note, in my instructions I suggested that people got moving with the QuickStart guide and *then* worried about the details. I think a lot of the problems that are being raised would be avoided if people followed that advice.</div>

<div class="content">I have to say from my experience that it worked exactly as Mark said - I wasn't 100% sure of everything when I read the Quick Start Guide but just started.  By the time I got to my first coffee break I actioned the "read rest of instructions" task and apart from the fact that they cleared up a few questions as to whether I was "doing it right", I had already experienced the almost uncanny way in which the system did somehow eliminate procrastination and create a real excitement about doing things - included things I had previously resisted. The fact is that it does what it says on the tin (with apologies to any non-uk readers who haven't seen that particular commercial :-)</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Christine. I started as soon as I had read the Quick Start section of Mark's email and skimmed the rest. I wasn't able to fully work it the first day as I was out all afternoon on previously scheduled tasks which hadn't been Autofocused! However, I managed to make a start on my first page and continued adding to my list.<br><br>The only 'mistake' I made was in highlighting too early - I somehow amalgamated two instructions and highlighted all the remaining tasks after a final pass through my first page had nothing left that stood out to me when I should have just moved onto the next page without highlighting. But I soon realised the error of my ways when I read some of the comments on the forum and now I know better!<br><br>Anyway, it does seem to be working incredibly well even though I'm still cheating by throwing in a few instant tasks that have interrupted me and called immediate attention to themselves. Where I can add them to the bottom of the list to be done later I have though. <br><br>I can see that when I'm faster at going through my pages then there will be fewer and fewer tasks that need immediate attention. I have also already tackled two grotty jobs that have been calling for ages but I kept resisting - now I did them and actually WANTED to do them - amazing!!</div>
