<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-27 23:14</div>
<div class="content">I am sure it has been covered before but I couldn't locate any posts that answers my question.<br><br>I have a page which only contains items for which I am waiting for or some errands that I cannot run at that specific time. According to AF, I must dismiss the page with all the items if I don't action any of them. But, with the type of items I mentioned, I cannot action them but I don't want to dismiss them either. Common sense says that treat this as an exception and move on to the next page. <br><br>Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">The easiest way to deal with items such as these is to rephrase them.  The process of rephrasing effectively analyses the type of task and identifies whether a further system is needed to control that type of task in the future.<br><br>For example, if I have on my list a task "buy sausages" which I cannot do until I go to the Supermarket, I change that to "add sausages to shopping list", create a shopping list and use that for all future shopping list items.<br><br>If I have something that is dependent upon something else, e.g. "email Fred with report on xyz"  which requires the report to be completed before it can be actioned, I would treat it like a project and action it by replacing it with the "project" steps, e.g. obtain data for report, compile report, email report to Fred.<br><br>I am finding that the more I work with AF the easier it is to recognise which items can truly be dismissed and which need to be rephrased or handled differently than originally anticipated.  I think that type of item will become rarer as we will be training ourselves to write our tasks in a different format going forward.<br><br>Hope that makes some sense ...... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Your answer is as usual so clear and fresh! I am still adding items to FAQs but they should be organised and put in a place where people could see and check it.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Silvia.<br><br>I've really appreciated you adding to the FAQ's page - I hoped to update that as well as the MBTI post this week but have had to devote most of my time this week to my tax returns - not stressing about them like other years though!  Have made recreation time to check the blog each time I feel like I have worked on my accounts for "as long as I feel"  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Quoth Christine B: "The easiest way to deal with items such as these is to rephrase them."<br><br>So does "rephrasing" count as having done some work on the original item? When you rephrase, do you cross the original out as you add rephrased items at the end? (Thus allowing you to move to the next page...)<br><br>ds</div>

<div class="content">>So does "rephrasing" count as having done some work on the <br>>original item? <br><br>Yes, because thinking counts as work in terms of AF.<br><br>>When you rephrase, do you cross the original out as you add <br>>rephrased items at the end? (Thus allowing you to move to the<br>>next page...)<br><br>Yes, that's why you do it. You want to make progress.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Christine B,<br><br>FAQs now are excellent!   I am sure you are working a lot! I still think it would be better in a separate place. If no item is added it will doon dissapear from the first page.<br><br>Mark, what you think about adding it to the column in the left?<br></div>
