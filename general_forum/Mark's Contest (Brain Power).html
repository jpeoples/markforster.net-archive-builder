<div class="content">My favorite thing about this contest is how it is drawing contributions from all kinds of people whose names I've never seen before on the Discussion Forum!</div>

<div class="content">This goes out to Jupiter.<br><br>Jupiter, in that other thread you wrote:<br><br>------------------------------------------------------<br>Answering to the question “Does using SuperFocus increase your brain power?” is really uneasy for me, just because things are getting very complicated in my life and I have be obliged by the events to come back very quickly to GTD even if SF was really my preferential system. <br><br>About SF, since I used it, I have noticed a strange experience (common with with AF1, AF4), it's the incredible increasement of my brain power but I must precise my thinking. <br><br>Working on tasks little by little without any link with my projects has a real impact on my thinking creativity. My brain find solution I could not imagine. Then, the system seems perfect for working on some topics or projects which are not too numerous or too complicated. <br><br>But when things are getting really complicated ie multiples projects, strategic decision, multiple action to do in the rush I notice that for me GTD is much better and make me more creative, efficient. GTD force me to be more creative and give me a better control than SF. <br><br>Then in a way, for me SF yes increases the brain power but the engine is intuition, heuristic scheme of Tony Buzan increase brain power and the engine is creativity, GTD increase brainpower but is engine is rationality.<br><br>Anyway I realize at last that i am like a sailor on the sea. When the sea is quiet I am comfortable with SF, but when there is a terrible storm, juste like what happened for me about the last two weeks, nothing is better for me than GTD. <br><br>Life is never as simple as we imagine. <br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In the same thread I answered and because I guess you didn't see it (as it was deleted), I re-post it here:<br><br>Jupiter,<br><br>it seems like you and me are in the same boat here. The cause of this situation is probably that we start to "do things as they show up" when chaos strikes back. And when we feel that we are about to lose control on the work, we clutch the straw of GTD (which worked so well in gaining control in the past). Having regained control we noticed that GTD offers no perspective, and we start with Autofocus / Superfocus again. Looks like a pendulum to me.<br><br>But then again, maybe that's the way that SuperFocus could increase your brain power: by gaining perspective?</div>

<div class="content">@Rainer. <br><br>Yes may be. But depends on what we say about perspective. For me perspective is what we call in GTD LEVELS ie seeing globally the bigs rocks of every aspect of my life and decide. SF is not a global system. It is a specific task and action system. GTD is a global system includind control (what does perfectly SF in acting) and perspective replacing it system instead of contexts. <br><br>Now I feel more comfortable with GTD about the feeling of control because SF is un able now to give me all relatives tasks about a project or at a certain level the consequences of one task on a pre defined aim. But in action I admit that the system is incredibly addictive and it pull my intuition on the most important things to do at the right time. More it stop proscratrination. And this is important too. <br><br>But I also now that for my efficiency like you Rainer i often come back to GTD <br><br>I guess the better system for me would be to integrate SF RULES inside GTD RULES. I almost succeed. It is possible on paper. So I guess it may be possible on digital. Why not  ?</div>

<div class="content">I still think GTD is overly complex. I'm seeking a better solution that leverages the power of SuperFocus to achieve the qualities you cite for GTD.</div>

<div class="content">Mark closed the comments in the "experiment" blog entry, meaning he has now made his decision about the "winner"... Any prediction about his identity ? The 5 remaining posts are all very good but it seems to me that Seraphim really got in to win...</div>

<div class="content">Congratulations to Seraphim. Did you win a red sweater? ;) Excellent comment, though personally, I liked Ryan Freckleton's the most. They were all top-notch submissions and I take my hat off to all five.</div>
