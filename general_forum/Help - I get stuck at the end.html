<div class="content">With AF2 I am getting stuck at the business end of the list. I find that the only way to get back to the "on notice" items is to leapfrog the rest of the list. The upshot now is that I have 25 tasks left on the list that will be "on notice" tomorrow.<br><br>This can't be right. What am I doing wrong?</div>

<div class="content">I feel your pain.  I have the same problem.  There seems to be no way, in AF2, to get back to the "on notice" items.  Not everyone seems to have this problem.  I'm repeatedly told that it will all work out.  It has not worked out for about two weeks now.<br><br>In anticipation of somehow getting back to the beginning, I've suspended all dismissal.  Not a good solution, but better than copying items back and forth from the AF list to the "someday/maybe" list.  So now my AF2 list has become an old style TO DO list with me working on the most urgent items and occasionally tripping over old ones and doing them in the course of doing other things.</div>

<div class="content">Why do the 'on notice' items stand out less than anything else?<br><br>Because they deserve and so need to be dismissed, surely.</div>

<div class="content">I have the same problem as well. I like that I am getting the urgent things done quicker, and I am not that worried about what I am dismissing (like smiley said they probably deserve to be dismissed) but there is good stuff in the middle of the list that I never get to as I keep starting over a the end and other things jump right out at me.</div>

<div class="content">OY!  Smiley, not yet again!<br><br>Look, standout schmandout!  If I can't SEE the fricken' things they are simply not there to STAND OUT!  Sheeesh.  I keep 'splainin' that and no one seems to hear me.  A voice in the wilderness, that's me ;-)<br><br>The ONLY way an "on notice" task can "stand out" is if I were to start at the end and SKIP OVER ALL THE TASKS UNTIL I GOT TO THE BEGINNING.  Otherwise, three or four tasks up from the bottom something "stands out" and I'm stuck there doing it for the rest of the day ... or that one and the next six others.  Then, during the day, I add 15 more tasks, most of them URGENT and so THEY stand out ... like big ole sore thumbs ... which all conspires to keep me at the end of the list.<br><br>If I have 10 open pages on Monday, on Tuesday I'll have done a half dozen items on the last page and added another page so I'll have 11 open pages.  On Wednesday, I'll have done a few of Tuesday's items, maybe one or two more of Monday's, but added yet another page of items.  On Thursday, I'm even further behind, with now 12 open pages (ready to be 13) and being forced further and further away from the beginning of the list.  I never get back to the beginning of the list except to mark items that live there as "on notice".  (Unless they are so urgent that I pull them off of the AF list and put them on an index card so they WILL get done.  But that is the ONLY way they will get done.  They will never be seen in AF2 except to be marked for dismissal.)<br><br>And that is why I no longer dismiss anything.  Which has wrecked the functioning of AF.  And since I am forced to the end continually, pages do not close and so the list is growing arithmetically.  I had about 18 pages on July 1st and this morning I have just started page number 35.  By day's end, I'll bet I'm up to 36 or 37.  I hold out no hope that a page will close.<br><br>I'm giving it until month's end to see if the magic everyone says will happen, happens.  If not, then I'll re-do the AF2 rules force work at the first active page before going to the end.  Much like the system mentioned by someone else.<br><br>So that is the story on "standing out".  I'm taking time out of my tasks today to make a voodoo doll and I will assign it to the next person who tells me that the "on notice" tasks will "stand out" ... I'm collecting my pins now ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I don't get the quick dismissal at all.  I've read through the instructions a number of times and a bunch of AF2 threads, but it just doesn't jive with me.  There's things on the list that I simply can't dismiss.  That's why they call it work - you have to do a lot of it.  Or dr. appointments - I need to make them, even if I haven't taken action yet.  In terms of working backwards on the list, I kind of already did that with AF1.  Also, I'm a little loose about which item I start on - I don't strictly stop at something at the end--I want to keep the rest of the list front and center, so I review the whole list at least once if not multiple times a day.  The "dismissal" concept has been helping, even though I'm not actually dismissing something, because I am taking action on more things and either eliminating them or moving them forward on this list after taking some action.</div>

<div class="content">A couple of points.  You do not have to work on each item in order from newest to oldest.  You merely have to look at each to see what stands out.  The reason you read through each item at the beginning of the day, is that it puts the whole list into your mind so you can filter what needs to be done, using a combination of the rational and intuitive.  <br><br>What happens with most of us, is that if we really need to work on the items "to be dismissed" then we find that the newer items just don't stand out that much, even if they are fairly urgent, so we skip over them.  Let's say I come to a task that is fairly new and one that I could easily and want to do, so it stands out somewhat.  Whether it stands out enough for me to work on right now is determined by several factors--the need I have to get to older items, and the fact that I will certainly get back to this other task frequently.  There is a force inside me that on some days moves me quickly through the list and on other days keeps me where the newest items are, all based on my overall contextual understanding of the whole list.<br><br>But if you are ready to dismiss 25 items at once, then your list may be too long or you have little discretionary time.  If you are forced by your job to add large numbers of extremely urgent and time critical tasks, then that may be the problem.  Otherwise, if you really need to get to older items, then the newer items just won't stand out.  You can skip them (provided you do look at them.)</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br>If you are doing only 6 or so items each day and adding new pages each day or so, then I can't see how AF (or any list method) will work if this continues.  You only have so many hours in the day to do your list.<br><br>You can read through your list several times through the day.  An item at the beginning of  my list can't stand out until I actually look at it of course, but the items I am looking at right now (maybe newer items) will not likely stand out if I "know" that there are older, but urgent, items I need to work on, allowing me to move through the list faster.<br><br>But it still sounds like you have too many item on your plate.<br><br>Balfour <br><br>You don't put Doctor appointments on your list.  If you mean a task to call the doctor, then if the item is up for dismissal, then it more than likely has been on the list for a number of days.  The idea is that if you are looking through the list each day, then you will know which items are up for dismissal and which will be up for dismissal over the next several days--all of which becomes a force that will affect what items stand out and how fast you move through the list.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I enjoy your posts and completely understand.  I am understanding the logic of the system the same way.<br><br>Fortunately, I don't have scads of active pages and never have.  I have a list at work and one at home.  I currently have 5 active pages in my work list and just started a sixth.  The older pages become more sparse as I pick away at them.  I have 19 closed pages (having started pretty much at the very introduction of AF1 and continuing with my original list/notebook into AF2), with a very, very few dismissed items that I've highlighted.  These items are nearly all of exactly the same type, that will get completed at some time.  <br><br>I'm very curious: why do people have such huge numbers of pages?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris,<br><br>>>>  A couple of points. You do not have to work on each item in order from newest to oldest. You merely have to look at each to see what stands out. The reason you read through each item at the beginning of the day, is that it puts the whole list into your mind so you can filter what needs to be done, using a combination of the rational and intuitive.  <<<<br><br><sigh>  Once more.  That simply does NOT HAPPEN.  Yes, going through the list in the morning gets me muttering: "Yeah, I've got to get to that.  Yup, that too.  And that."  However, once I start on the last page, the items I just wrote there recently are the really HOT ones so THEY stand out.  The ones I saw first thing in the morning are long in the distant past when compared to the hot new things on the list.  That is simply the way it works.<br><br>>>> What happens with most of us, is that if we really need to work on the items "to be dismissed" then we find that the newer items just don't stand out that much, even if they are fairly urgent, so we skip over them.  <<<<br><br>Yea, it apparently works that way for you ... but not for me.<br><br>>>>   Let's say I come to a task that is fairly new and one that I could easily and want to do, so it stands out somewhat.

However that does not happen.  The last pages stand out the most.<br><br>>>>  But if you are ready to dismiss 25 items at once, then your list may be too long or you have little discretionary time. If you are forced by your job to add large numbers of extremely urgent and time critical tasks, then that may be the problem. <<<<br><br>No, I did not say I had a great number of items to dismiss.  I said I had stopped dismissing entirely.<br><br><<<  Otherwise, if you really need to get to older items, then the newer items just won't stand out. You can skip them (provided you do look at them.)  <<<<br><br>I just don't get why you are telling me that.  I said, any number of times, that it is simply not true for me.  Yet you (and some others) continue to imply that I must be "broken" somehow if I don't see things your way.  I just don't get it.<br><br>*** If I need to get to an older item I have to DO IT, not move to some other page of a list and look at items there.  If I do THAT, then I will work on items THERE, not the ones that need to get done. ***<br><br>I don't get why this is such a hard idea to communicate.  If I need to mow the yard it does not make sense to go to the movies first so that I'll be nagged to get back to mowing the yard.  That's just crazy nuts, IMO.<br></div>

That's how I read AF2 and why I don't work it as written.  I am translating it into something that makes more sense to me, which is that I can't just dismiss all items that I haven't taken action on that are still there today.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lillian,<br><br>No, I'm sure Mark won't mind ;-)  The thing is that AF2 has advantages.  It moves faster.  It keeps the current stuff under control ... things were growing moldy with AF1.  The problem I'm having is with getting to the beginning and the dismissal rule.<br><br>Barring magic, the only fix for me will be to add a rule that puts me working on the first pages before transferring me to the last pages.  Of course, then the middle will go wanting.  But I guess if I close the first pages at a reasonable rate that will take care of itself.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Again Chris,<br><br>>>>  If you are doing only 6 or so items each day and adding new pages each day or so, then I can't see how AF (or any list method) will work if this continues. You only have so many hours in the day to do your list.  <<<<br><br>Exactly the problem which AF2 surfaced.  With AF1 I was working the old items and the current things were coming up more slowly.  But with AF2, I'm working the more current things and so that is causing more current things to be spawned.  Example:<br><br>New item in both AF1 and AF2: "Fix up bike for trip on Thursday"<br><br>In AF1, I'd be working on early pages and not get to it for a while.<br>In AF2, I'd go right to that and start "fixing"  Which would spawn:<br><br>- Go to bike store: Buy tubes<br>- Get current maps of C&O trail<br>- Email X to ask how his trip went<br>- Buy snacks to eat on ride<br>- Learn how to fix a flat<br>- Get tools to fix flat<br>- Get new pump<br>- etc.<br><br>So you see that six tasks came from that one ... and that happens for most of these things.  It just seems as if the older tasks spawn fewer things.  Maybe because they are not so urgent and so I work on them in blocked time?  I dunno.<br><br>>>> You can read through your list several times through the day.  <<<<br><br>Why would I want to do that? !!!  Now it is becoming like GTD with the overhead swamping the actual doing of things.  It takes me a good 10 - 15 minutes to read the list over.  I could easily lose an hour of productive time to list maintenance.  It strikes me that is the wrong way to go.<br><br>>>>  An item at the beginning of my list can't stand out until I actually look at it of course, but the items I am looking at right now (maybe newer items) will not likely stand out if I "know" that there are older, but urgent, items I need to work on, allowing me to move through the list faster.  <<<<br><br>EEEEEK!  There it is again! ;-)  Why oh why do you keep saying that every time in answer to my saying that it is NOT true?  This is starting to sound like the old GTD list where if you had a problem you were just "wrong" and had to make yourself "right" so that the GTD system would work for you.<br><br>>>>  But it still sounds like you have too many item on your plate.  <<<<br><br>It is more a question of them breeding like bunnies ;-)<br><br>>>>  You don't put Doctor appointments on your list. If you mean a task to call the doctor, then if the item is up for dismissal, then it more than likely has been on the list for a number of days. The idea is that if you are looking through the list each day, then you will know which items are up for dismissal and which will be up for dismissal over the next several days--all of which becomes a force that will affect what items stand out and how fast you move through the list.   <<<<br><br>So he's broken too?  If 500 people all posted here that they had this problem, would you tell them all that the items will just "stand out"?  LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mike.  I still simply don't get it.  This is what I'm understanding (forgive me if I'm just repeating myself):<br><br>BEFORE I add anything to the list today, I draw a line at the end of my list.  Everything prior to that line is "on notice."  If I don't take action on any of those by the end of today, I dismiss them all.  <br><br>Otherwise, what do you mean by a "block"?

<div class="content">Hi Balfour,<br><br>No, you really do have it wrong.<br><br>START THE DAY<br>1 - Look at yesterday's tasks marked "on notice" and dismiss those not done<br>2 - Find the next "block" of tasks.<br><br>*** A block of tasks is one or more OPEN tasks between the last CLOSED (dismissed or done) task and then next CLOSED task.  Example:  ([X} is done, [ ] is OPEN]<br><br>[X] Call Joe<br>[  ] Fix car<br>[  ] Conquer world<br>[X] Make coffee <br>[X] Drink coffee<br>[  ] Wash cup<br>[X] Call Mary<br><br>So "Fix car" and "Conquer World" are the first block to be put on notice.  If you don't wash that cup, it will go on notice tomorrow and "Fix car" and "Conquer world" will be dismissed then if not done.<br><br>3) Mark next block "on notice"  (Wash Cup)<br>4) Scan list<br>5) Start working from bottom up.<br><br>That is how it works ... it says here in fine print ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike, I feel your pain!<br><br>I use a Mead composition notebook (the type I used in 5th grade :) ) I have 30 open pages. As I said before, I have no problem dismissing-- I'm the first to admit I have too much to do and I like that I can "throw anything" at AF (and I do!)-- and I review dismissed items about once a week and add them to the end of the list if necessary. I also liek that AF2 deals with urgent items better. that being said, I have two problems:<br><br>1) Stuff in the middle for me does not get done. I rarely am able to go back more than five pages in a given workday.<br><br>2) I am no longer asking the question that I used to ask in AF1, "why did I dismiss this item?" I liked that there were pages in AF1 where nothing stood out, I would use that opportunity to either bite the bullet and do something I was avoiding or accept that I am not doing it anytime soon and dismiss it. Nowadays I always know why I dismissed an item, it has nothing to do with the item itself, it is because my list is too long!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-14 21:36</div>
<div class="content">I think there are a couple of possible solutions.  First if something is urgent and needs to be done, just do it.  My basic strategy is before I use the system I check my intuition to see if there is something compelling and urgent that needs to be done right now, regardless of the list.  <br><br>That usually solves the issue of burning issues that the system doesn't get you to right away.  AF2 seems to trade-off the ability to move rapidly and build momentum on current and important tasks against allowing some items to get stranded.  I solve that in two ways:<br><br>a) After reading through the list from front to back, some items stick out immediately as urgent so I just do those first.<br>b) I do one single pass from back to front at least once a day (so after completing a task I don't jump to the end again I keep moving back through).<br><br>Applying those two rules has really helped me avoid the dilemma you describe, which I think it a real dilemma if you follow the rules too literally.  Overall I'm very happy with AF2 because it solves the 2 major dilemma for me with AF: my resistance to dismiss items and the inability to keep current important items moving because you couldn't get to the newest items quickly enough.</div>

<div class="content">Why not do something like AF1 in the morning and AF2 in the afternoons?   Or do AF1 one day (when you have lots of discretionary time) and AF2 the next (when you don't have lots of discretionary time or have deadlines to meet)?  Or just do one pass with AF1 through your pages daily?  And dismiss using AF2 rules.  It seems to me someone can switch back and forth very easily between the two systems - or at least that's what I found when I switched back to AF1 from AF2.  <br><br>I switch back and forth from AF Condensed to AF1 weekly and by working two systems, it seems I get more done than ever and the planned switch in systems keeps things lively.<br><br>There's something to be said for keeping the strengths of BOTH systems.  I just don't think it's an either / or proposition.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I am finding with AF2 that i am even more familiar with my list so know if something urgent is further back in the list.  That said, newer items will invariably stand out more which meant that, if I was going to action my on notice items according to the rules I had to ignore the standing out items as having less pull.  That felt wrong - and I suspect that is what is happening to you.  Whereas for you it seems the pull of the recent items virtually wipes out the memory of the old (in that you do not see them again) for me it just left a discomfort until I went back - but it felt like I was forcing it.<br><br>For me the solution has been to action my on notice items if I feel like it at any time of the day that I feel like!  That to me feels more like AF than forcing myself back against other standing out items.  I can then quite happily do whatever stands out, wherever it is, and whilst I work a lot at the end of the list it is getting quicker to move back because the latter pages are nearly complete.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Two simple suggestions for you in a second, after I first admit I don't have a silver bullet for you; and explain that my work is 85% customer support; I am simply am not allowed to dismiss an item a customer needs answered and some days the new items do breed like bunnies. So I grok your pain.<br><br>Suggestion (1) be more macro/high level with the items you write down when it's practical. My simple example is; if you'll know what to do when the time comes don't break the task down any smaller. "buy milk" doesn't have to be written as "get money, grab keys, get in car, drive to store, walk to milk; pick milk, pay for milk, drive home, put in fridge".  Yes that is an absurd example but it's hard to miss the idea. I put big overall items in my list; that often have multiple steps. I trust that I know the next step or I write it in such away that it leads me to the obvious step; if it's a big project I just list "work on project" and I have the project outline somewhere else; when it's time to work on the project pull out the support materials and see where I was and continue. When I'm done update my notes put the support material away and put "work on project X" back on the list. For your bike store example I would have had "plan trip to bike store" on my list. after I did the planning on some index card or something else. I would have scratched it out, and wrote "go to bike store (take list)" on my AF2 list. I don't know if that would help you. I have to discipline myself to do that; and have faith that I will not mentally melt if I don't write the details down; after years of compulsive list making I admit to having to fight the urge with active effort. When I win the fight I am rewarded with more productivity.<br><br>Suggestion (2) Play Your Slice. Ask any golfer; if you have a SLICE you have to play it until you have time to fix it. If you constantly miss 30 feet to the right; aim 30 feet to the left. Here are some suggestions to play your slice depending on your hurdles. After 20 years I have no desire to "fix" my slice I know it's there and I use it well.<br><br>2a) if a task doesn't go BOOM today then give yourself permission to skip past it in favor of something that might be lurking in the list. Mark calls it intuition; I call it sensible choosing; there's a difference between that and just doing the fun stuff; that old saying inspiration is 98% perspiration; I don't get through the list anywhere as easy as Mark does; but I get through it by making choices and decisions as I go; I actively make my intuition and rational thoughts fight about what task to do. I have to drag myself through the list. Until I find a task I CAN'T resist doing (intuition) or one that will go BOOM if I don't do it (rational).<br><br>2b) If you can't resist those new items then find a way not to do the new items until they have matured/aged just a little. I had an old boss that would change his mind like the wind; our staff adopted an effective filter policy; until he asked for something the 3rd time we ignored the request. Sounds stupid but with him it work. <br><br>Each time you pass through the list; look at each item as you get to it. <br><br>(i) If it goes boom do it (be honest with yourself boom means QA-BOOM, not *pop*); <br>(ii) If no boom; then put a symbol like "!" in front of it. <br>(iii) If it has Qty 3, "!!!"  then don't add any more marks. <br>(iv) Don't do any tasks that doesn't have Qty 3 marks. <br><br>Three is an arbitrary number pick a number you like greater than or equal to 2.  That will force items it age a little bit and help get them off your reticulating radar.<br><br>3b) Break up your hyper focus if your job/ life requires that you task switch more frequently than you are naturally inclined to. <br><br>Get a $9 electronic kitchen time. If your not working on a BOOM task, Use it to make yourself stop a task at whatever interval works for you; I suspect 25 minutes would work for me; check off said task and add it to the end of the list. If you do (2b) you'll have to at least 3 other tasks from the list before you can restart that task.<br><br>If AF2 doesn't work for you, then do what does. No system is universal; my daughter and I have severe Gestalt learning issues. I don't expect anyone to think like we do; but we've both learned to maximize what's good and "manage" the bad. <br><br>You aren't broken; AF2 is not broken; there is a slight possibility that a percentage of the population is not compatible with AF2 out of the box.<br><br>I hope this helps a little; absolutely fascinating discussion....<br><br>(all attempts at humor in this post that failed are the responsibility of the author with apologies to the reader).<br></div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Smiley,<br><br>>>> If you're using a To Do list, how do you decide what's best to do next? <<<<br><br>The next undone item on the list is the next one to do.<br><br>If I were to use a  non-prioritized list, then the list would be short enough so that I could see everything on it.  See, with AF, it is more than a TO DO list.  It is also a "universal capture device" (n GtD parlance).  So it can become quite long and therefore things can lurk among other things, hiding in wait for you.<br><br>>>> For AF2 it might help to write a few of the 'on notice' items on an index card, then look at it as a reminder when _also_ looking at the 'hot' items later on in the list. <<<<br><br>That has been my practice since it became obvious to me that AF had this very dark side to it ;-)  <br><br>>>> If the 'on notice' items on the index card still don't stand out compared to the 'hot' items, surely the on notice items are ripe for DISMISSAL! ;-) <<<<br><br>Yes, in that case, using those tweaks, I agree.  The thing is, I was looking to find a way to make AF work, with no tweaks.  Mark (rightly) admonished me to use it as described before getting all grouchy about it.  I'm trying and failing.  My impression is that AF2 NEEDS tweaks in order to work for me.  AF1 did not.  But then, in a sense, AF2 is really a tweak on AF1 so it really should be no big thing.</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Veg,<br><br>>>> Mike, I feel your pain!  <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)  Yeah, it is been that way since AF2.  Though, and don't get me wrong on this point, I love some aspects of AF2.<br><br>>>> I use a Mead composition notebook (the type I used in 5th grade :) )  <<<<br><br>I love those.  Very nice size and no rings to catch.  And they are sewn.  I don't like that last aspect for AF, however as I like to keep my history of important things done separate from "take out the trash" so I rip out my AF pages and I would never do that to a sewn book ... there is something sacrilegious about that ;-)<br><br>>>>  have 30 open pages  <<<<br><br>That is quite a list.  Just about twice my size and already I'm' climbing the walls.<br><br>>>>.As I said before, I have no problem dismissing-- I'm the first to admit I have too much to do and I like that I can "throw anything" at AF (and I do!)-- and I review dismissed items about once a week and add them to the end of the list if necessary. I also liek that AF2 deals with urgent items better.  <<<<br><br>Those are also my reasons for sticking with this.  I just need to start tweaking, I guess.<br><br>>>> that being said, I have two problems:<br><br>1) Stuff in the middle for me does not get done. I rarely am able to go back more than five pages in a given workday. <<<<br><br>With me it is the middle and the beginning.<br><br>>>> 2) I am no longer asking the question that I used to ask in AF1, "why did I dismiss this item?" I liked that there were pages in AF1 where nothing stood out, I would use that opportunity to either bite the bullet and do something I was avoiding or accept that I am not doing it anytime soon and dismiss it. Nowadays I always know why I dismissed an item, it has nothing to do with the item itself, it is because my list is too long! <<<<br><br>I had not considered that side effect.  With AF1 it was because the task had not been done and was not going to be done NOW.  With AF2 it is just because it is the first undone task on the list.  Yes, that really is more arbitrary.  In reductio ad absurdum, if one just started and had a list of only 10 items, one would have to dismiss the first undone ones the very next day!  Of course, that is never the case, but does point out the arbitrariness of this aspect of it. But I also like that "moving line of doom" as someone put it.  There is also something attractive about inexorably clearing out the old.  (Remember the end of that Stephen King film, "The Langoliers" where those chomping things destroyed the past so it did not clutter up the present and future?  LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Power,<br><br>>>> I think there are a couple of possible solutions. First if something is urgent and needs to be done, just do it. My basic strategy is before I use the system I check my intuition to see if there is something compelling and urgent that needs to be done right now, regardless of the list. <<<<br><br>You have the description of my problem exactly backward.  AF2 is wonderful at handling the urgent ... it is less impressive at handling the IMPORTANT.  It is the important that is being neglected ... those things that need to be done whose time has not yet come for one reason or another.<br><br>>>>  That usually solves the issue of burning issues that the system doesn't get you to right away. AF2 seems to trade-off the ability to move rapidly and build momentum on current and important tasks  <<<br><br>I would say "current and urgent tasks".<br><br>>>> against allowing some items to get stranded. I solve that in two ways:<br><br>a) After reading through the list from front to back, some items stick out immediately as urgent so I just do those first. <<<<br><br>Yes, but what about important but not urgent?  The Q2 variety.  Balfour used the example: "Make Doctor's appointment" which had gone undone for some reason and he was still not ready to do.  It could be that he is not ready because he is uncertain of his schedule ... not because of simple procrastination.  In that case he does not WANT AF2 making him  make or dismiss his appointment.  He is not yet ready for good reason.<br><br>>>>  b) I do one single pass from back to front at least once a day (so after completing a task I don't jump to the end again I keep moving back through).  <<<<br><br>That will not work with long lists ... it takes too much time.  But it does indicate that most people are making SOME tweaks to AF2 in order to fight the "dismissal problem" ;-)<br><br>>>>  Applying those two rules has really helped me avoid the dilemma you describe, which I think it a real dilemma if you follow the rules too literally.  <<<<br><br>Yes, I'm wondering now how many people are really following the rules.  I suspect that I'll go back to my old AF1 tweak of culling out the things I want to do today and putting them on a second list (usually an index card but sometimes a Post-It) and making that list my priority list, and using AF to "fill" the time otherwise.  Then I will probably take the AF2 dismissal rule as more advisory than absolute ... IOW, those tasks would go on my priority list to get some kind of special treatment or at least very serious consideration of why they are not yet done.  But that does really start to remove the "auto" from "Autofocus".  I have to think if that is an entirely good thing or not.<br><br>>>> Overall I'm very happy with AF2 because it solves the 2 major dilemma for me with AF: my resistance to dismiss items and the inability to keep current important items moving because you couldn't get to the newest items quickly enough.  <<<<br><br>I agree.  I think a balance is what is really needed and I think Mark hit on something with his AF1/AF2 combo ... switching back and forth.  Maybe I don't want exactly that, but I need the effect of balancing working at the beginning of the list to get old things done and working at the end to keep current.  One thing I've noticed is that in AF2 I have many more repeated items.  IOW, I will have "Call Joe" on the list, undone, several times because I know it is important and I can't get to it once it sinks into the quicksand that is the beginning and middle of the AF2 list.  LOL ;-)  I have a continual feeling of de ja vu when I do my morning scan of the entire list.  "Huh, did I not just see that one a minute ago?"  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>>>>  Why not do something like AF1 in the morning and AF2 in the afternoons? Or do AF1 one day (when you have lots of discretionary time) and AF2 the next (when you don't have lots of discretionary time or have deadlines to meet)? Or just do one pass with AF1 through your pages daily? And dismiss using AF2 rules. It seems to me someone can switch back and forth very easily between the two systems - or at least that's what I found when I switched back to AF1 from AF2. <<<<br><br>I think that is what Mark proposed then backed away from.  Put a task on the list to switch over to the other processing method.  Yes, that is one answer. <br><br>>>> I switch back and forth from AF Condensed to AF1 weekly and by working two systems, it seems I get more done than ever and the planned switch in systems keeps things lively.<br><br>There's something to be said for keeping the strengths of BOTH systems. I just don't think it's an either / or proposition.  <<<<br><br>As I say, I've just reached the conclusion that perhaps no one is really doing pure AF2.  Maybe I'm the last one trying to make it work as described.  Well, I said I'd keep at it until the end of July ... but I still will only mark tasks "on notice" but not dismiss them.  I can't wreck my life, after all ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br><<<  I am finding with AF2 that i am even more familiar with my list so know if something urgent is further back in the list. That said, newer items will invariably stand out more which meant that, if I was going to action my on notice items according to the rules I had to ignore the standing out items as having less pull. That felt wrong - and I suspect that is what is happening to you. Whereas for you it seems the pull of the recent items virtually wipes out the memory of the old (in that you do not see them again) for me it just left a discomfort until I went back - but it felt like I was forcing it.  <<<<br><br>You are the first person to accurately restate my problem.  Yes, if you were to ask me, at any time of the day, "Is there anything important that needs to be done that is being overlooked", I'd be able to tell you.  BUT ... when working the list, the page of recent and urgent items wipes out memory of the old but important ones.<br><br>>>>  For me the solution has been to action my on notice items if I feel like it at any time of the day that I feel like! That to me feels more like AF than forcing myself back against other standing out items. I can then quite happily do whatever stands out, wherever it is, and whilst I work a lot at the end of the list it is getting quicker to move back because the latter pages are nearly complete.  <<<<br><br>Yes, but that is not AF2, as I understand it.  There is no "automatic" (i.e. rule driven) method to get you back to the early tasks that you know you ought to be working on.  I am even more convinced that no one but Mark is actually doing pure AF2.</div>

Work until the beep, reset and think of "What is the best use of my time right now?", then work on that until the beep.  If it is a bigger project, I switch to a 2 hour timer with a five minute timer after that -- for a break.

I can be, but it is not effective for the things I most want to do.  I will absolutely tweak the system.  In fact, I'm heading out for a week long bike trip (my wife is biking 318 miles along the Appalachian Trail from PA down to MD along the C&O canal.  (NOTE: She is doing the biking, I'm driving the chase car ;-)  So I'll have quite a bit of alone time in a different environment to think through my time management system.  I'm going to rip the whole mess up and reorder my tools.  Funny how I think better in the car, or a hotel room or someplace different.

<div class="content">Hi Will,<br><br>>>>  I and others have suggested this before: why not add a new task: "check dismissed tasks"?  <<<<br><br>Yeah, that kind of thing might be of some help.  There is something about adding things to the list that are just there to make the list work properly that rubs me the wrong way.  I don't want to make my list even longer by having a bunch of list maintenance chores on the list.  It might be a somewhat practical idea but it offends me from a systems point of view.  From a systems point of view I'd rather have the rules of the system outside of the system itself ... otherwise a nasty recursive loop can occur ;-)  I mean, if the last item on the list is "check the beginning" and I'm always going to the end ... well, you can see what will happen there ... it basically becomes AF1 with operation directions as list items rather than as rules! ;-) ;-)<br><br>What made AF so nice and attractive was the simplicity of it all.  If I now have to clutter my list with list management overhead that will bog it down too much.  That was why though I liked Mark's "switch to AF1" entry but then dropped the idea.<br><br>Moreover, it takes away the "auto" from AutoFocus.</div>

<div class="content">Wow, fascinating discussion.<br><br>>I and others have suggested this before: why not add a new task: "check dismissed tasks"?<br><br>This gets to the heart of it for me. And more especially perhaps with Balfour's posts here even than with Mike's. I continue to believe Mark's biggest error with both versions of AF was his decision to use the word "dismissal" for a process that really does NOT involve dismissing tasks, but rather putting them on the back burner in terms of daily action and actually bringing them FRONT AND FORWARD in terms of analysis and inspection. This is not what dismissal means in common parlance!<br><br>If you have a repeating task near the end of your list to review your dismissed tasks, and if you follow the AF rule to "let some time pass" and to think hard about them before re-entering them, you will surely develop an end-of-list that mixes the important and the urgent, solving your problem.<br><br>(If you simply have too many things that you are equally committed to doing that's different of course, and not AF's fault.)<br><br>Balfour wrote:<br><br>>There's things on the list that I simply can't dismiss. That's why they call it work - you have to do a lot of it. <br><br>Again this only makes sense if dismissing something means you don't have to do it. It doesn't.</div>

<div class="content">Actually, rereading the question, what AF is doing for Mike is filtering out the urgent tasks, which are getting done, and dismissing some of the important ones with the dross. <br><br>Maybe a quick review of the tasks in the danger zone to pull out the important ones? Or, counter intuitively, to manually eliminate the dross so that the dismissed becomes a treasury of important tasks for periodic review?<br><br>As you can tell, I am NOT an inventor of task management systems.

<div class="content">ludlow - I completely agree that the choice of the word "dismissal" is part of the problem.  You don't actually have to throw the item away.  My out of sight but not forgotten items, which I create by highlighting, allowing me to complete a page, can come back when I'm ready to do it.  These are primarily in the non-urgent, someday/maybe realm for me so far.  <br><br>Mike, I have to thank you again for explaining my wrong approach.  I think I've got it now.  I also went back and read something in a thread by Mark further explaining how to walk through the system each day.  Yesterday after I got it, I used the "on notice" technique on both work and home lists and I really got some stuff moving!  Accompanied by a huge burst of energy and euphoria!  (If my friends could see me now...)<br><br>Part of the problem with the old lingering items in the original AF was how to pick among a landscape where nothing stood out and nothing was immediately urgent.  The "on notice" method creates a way to just pick and clear out the old stuff.  <br><br>Mark, you're a genius!</div>

I have to drag myself through the list. Until I find a task I CAN'T resist doing (intuition) or one that will go BOOM if I don't do it (rational). <<<<br><br>>>Yes. That is where the tweaks come in. I was trying to work without the tweaks but now I see that is not going to be possible.<<<br><br>>>> Each time you pass through the list; look at each item as you get to it. <br>(i) If it goes boom do it (be honest with yourself boom means QA-BOOM, not *pop*); <br>(ii) If no boom; then put a symbol like "!" in front of it. <br>(iii) If it has Qty 3, "!!!" then don't add any more marks. <br>(iv) Don't do any tasks that doesn't have Qty 3 marks. <br><br>Three is an arbitrary number pick a number you like greater than or equal to 2.

I know that sounds like blaming you; but it's not, it's about learning the right way to modify system when you tweak. When Mark creates these things he puts in processes that tweak the human; in the end it's one elegant Human tweak. But some rules are fundamental; you can add more but you shouldn't change the foundation ones or you get bizarre results.<br><br>More precisely... <br><br>Enhancements should not change the LONG term behavior of a system. Long term is usually a signal that the change is breaking the elemental design; tweaks that have a short term impact on the system are usually focused on tweaking the users. I've delt with this issue in software design over the years. AF2 really is just a logic flow like a piece of software is....<br><br>Examples of tweaking the human (good tweaks):  My "!!!" tweak only last for the execution of 3-5 tasks then it vanishes; it manages my behavior. It's a buffer to slow down my high revving engine. Marks Process of drawing the daily line as manages my behavior; the effect of the line lasts 1 day; after that those tasks vanish and the impact of the line moves down the list to new victums. The line manages the human.<br><br>Example of tweaking the system (bad tweaks / gamming the system): The suggestion to re-write all urgent items on notice for dismissal at the end of the list so they are in the "newness" zone.  That has a long term impact because you've reset the aging timer and it will take days for them to re-age again; that too long term. Esenntially. that's gaming the system because Autofocus is based on an "aging" principle; if you game it like this you wreck the way the foundation works and the system will destabilize. <br><br>Example of a possible good tweak (the worries tweak); write all dismissed items into a separate note book, autofocus style. Every 2 weeks; process that dismissed book AF1 style; add back 1 item per page and no more to AF2 book; if you can find something on a page that you want to add back; then dismiss the page with confidence that they really are dead items.<br><br>For ME ME ME, I focus on leaving autofocus rules the same; and tweaking the way I select things with my intuition, because that's my flaw I get trapped on the end of the list and don't move through it; I need to give myself permission to let that phone call go to voicemail for process later.

Just curious. Never heard that term.<<<br><br>Danger danger tangent at hand.....<br><br>Gestalt learners are mild Aspergers syndrome people; which are mild Autistic. There is an exponential progress from Gestalt through Aspergers to Autistic.  Each one is much more debilitating the than the previous. Gestalt is just getting recognition lately the Aspergers is well accepted now but that's a recent development.<br><br>Gestalt learners learn in chunks; you learn learn learn learn and understand nothing and you can use it, but you sense the pattern; finally once you learn enough chucks, BAM! all of it clicks at once; and you get all of it. This were the lightbulb going on analogy comes from. Everyone has a little of this; Gestalt are 80-100% that experience. Gestalts tend to be very slow to learn verbal language; non verbal queues; and social interactions.<br><br>If taught via Drill and Grill, around 7th-8th grade Gestalts master their learning style and usually start out performing the norms because the harder the subject matter is; the more you have to "chunk it" to learn it and the Gestalt's have been doing that all along and they get very very good at it; and they excel at high math; science, and oddly the visual arts. Often the are called "late bloomers" as if something magical happens.<br><br>40 years ago U.S. Schools taught via Rot-Repetitive or Drill and Grill if you prefer. Gestalt's learn well that way and so do "Normals".  So nobody noticed those students with that pre-disposistion in the population; they stayed below the radar for the most part; simply late bloomers. Today U.S. Schools don't do Drill and Grill any more because the "Norms" learn better without it, and Drill and Grill is boring for the teachers. (No offense teachers I love you and I'd find it boring too), but The Gestalt's fail miserably with this style. So now there is a whole new trend in public schools of getting the 5% of the students that are Gestalt labelled as Autistic and there-by funded with public money so they can get special sessions in school to basically drill and grill these kids.<br><br>I was lucky, I grew up in the Drill and Grill world; we have to school my daughter in parallel at home using Drill and Grill. It took forever to get her diagnosed; it's an all new area of learning science about 10 years old and not fully understood; I understand what I do, because I read the papers and realized the papers were about ME so I was able to grok it very fast and figure out how to help her; aka teach her the way I learn and *poof* results.<br><br>I find myself help more families understand this each year.<br><br>.....Tangent over.....<br><br>>>> You aren't broken; AF2 is not broken; there is a slight possibility that a percentage of the population is not compatible with AF2 out of the box. <<<<br><br>>>Yes.

One of the things that I have always tried to do when creating systems (TM or otherwise) is to look at what the person using it requires.  Just because something works for one person in no way means it will work for everyone.  What I have loved about AF has been the way in which it has enabled me to identify how "I" work or react to things (eg my dishwasher moment).  Realising that I had a great resistance to being told "when" to do something, freed up a lot of things.  Using AF to work on things "when" I wanted was a major breakthrough - but probably would have been totally meaningless to many others. The fact that AF2 has enabled you to identify a very specific "need" in the way you work is actually a really positive thing - once you know the what you can work with it - adapting to the slice as ratz put it.<br><br>It makes me realise that is what I was trying to explain in the discussion with Norman U about "must do" items.  The "need" to do certain items is not necessarily driven by any degree of urgency or importance but by something else, maybe a need not to fail, or just that it is on the page, or that it is holding up something else.  As I see it the important thing is to recognise those drivers - we can then choose whether we want to eliminate them or work around them, but if we do not recognise that they are there we will always be that 30 yards off target.<br></div>

It was like looking in the mirror..........but you burst my bubble when you called it a learning disability.  I always felted highly advantaged over the other students.  I'd simply be patient for a little while in the beginning. Then when the Gestalt happened, I'd be catapulted waaaay ahead.  They kept bumping me up to more advanced learning.

<div class="content">Hi Power Secrets<br><br>That's an excellent point.  It is the "standing out" that is unique and there are a number of posts on this from the early days of AF1 Beta Testing.  I think the problems come when one succombs to the pressure of the urgent and forgets to "trust the system".  I would say I had probably stated to fall victim to that and AF2 is rekindling that connection with the intuitive standing out process.  Thanks for the reminder! :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go.<br><br>I guess we understand the meaning of the word generalization a bit differently, but that's not really worth arguing about here.<br><br>My central point was that tweaking the system with structural or sequence changes isn't likely to address the issue of why the important tasks don't stand out for someone.  I think that the AF process provides mechanisms for calling out items not being addressed which is a big step forward.  It doesn't explicitly address how to make arrangements with your intuition, which may be one reason why it works great for some and not for others.<br><br>Purely my opinion of course, but maybe I need to state that very clearly on each post.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Power Secrets, Learning,<br><br>Actually, you can't tweak the system endlessly - at least until you have really mastered it. <br><br>Wax on; wax off (repeat for ten years).<br><br>On the other hand,<br>1. the system itself is new and changing every few months as Mark comes up with revisions: this is not yet a grounded system like the Japanese martial arts (which still evolve, but directed by masters with many years of deep understanding)<br>2. when problems arise, we need to judge for ourselves whether there is something special about us that the system doesn't fit or there is an issue in the way we are implementing the system. We have only each other and Mark for guidance.<br><br>It probably shows some deep inner insecurity, but my personal preference is to attempt to follow the system. without any sort of tweak, but to follow this forum for issues and for views on how to deal with problems. At the moment I too am struggling to get all the way through the list, so things are getting dismissed. Partly because I am spending too long in the forum.<br><br>But I respect those who take full ownership for their working style and are adapting their own systems.

<div class="content">There are so many great comments in this thread!  One of the things I love about AF is that it really does give so much more insight into our ways of working than any other system I have ever tried.  The key to that I am sure is the element of intuition but that in itself creates more and more interesting discussions.  It feels like AF and it's effect is evolving - no wonder Mark is never satisfied with a system - I think the system itself is so good that it does actually enable us to change, both our working methods and our approach, and that in turn throws up new challenges.<br><br>The massive breakthrough with AF1 for me was the process of "standing out".  It provided a systemic approach to creating that feeling of "flow" and all of a sudden work was not only easy but enjoyable.  That position has proved more difficult for some to grasp than others but when that feeling occurs it is almost magical.  However I think some people don't necessarily want or need that approach, preferring instead the sense of control that rationalisation brings and that is where the tension can lie.<br><br>For me, I "got" the standing out process almost straight away and felt very fortunate to do so.  However with the advent of AF2 I realise that I had somehow drifted back to a more rational way of working.  I can see that there is still a part of me that has that rational desire - in that I have tweaked the timing of working the on notice items - but AF2 has gotten me back so much closer to that flow process.  Being able to choose from anywhere in the list, and to skip over pages that do not stand out, has freed up a lot of items which I was clearly inhibiting from standing out in that I was saving them to enable procrastination on other items.  Knowing that that red line will reach them regardless is a whole new incentive.  I can no longer procrastinate on them.  They must be done or dismissed TODAY!<br><br>I have three items on notice today, none of which I have gotten back to yet.  I want to do them (mainly because I don't want a long list of dismissed items to review later) but may well just dismiss them - we'll see.  That is so less stressful than feeling obligated to do something on the page because there are items that "can't" be dismissed.<br></div>

I'm chasing my wife through PA right now ;-)  (well, at this exact moment she is snoring peacefully but she'll be up soon to start the game again ;--<br><br>>>>  Wouldn’t you have to do the same 6 spawned tasks to do no matter when you first wrote ‘fix bike’ on your list?  <<<<br><br>No, as I said, that was not the case in AF1.  I suspect that it was due to AF1 being "slower".  Working with more urgent and immediate tasks seems to make me want to fill in the details more than it does with things that are older.<br><br>>>>  Have you thought of using a book with more pages per line? If you have a page with 30 lines, you just cut the number of pages in half even though you have the same # of projects – but the list may be easier to manage if you have 4 open pages rather than 8.  <<<<br><br>A larger book would have a very different effect.  However, I am self-constrained by my mobility.  I don't want to carry things with me if I can avoid it so I use a spiral wire bound notebook in vertical 3x5 inch format.  I stuff a 1/2 size pen in the wire and it never leaves my pocket.  If I had to carry a larger book around with me, I'd forget it more often than not.<br><br>>>> so I rip out my AF pages and I would never do that to a sewn book ... there is something sacrilegious about that <<<<br><br>>>Not to mention that the other pages would start to fall out and that’s probably not the best way to lower the number of open pages you have LOL <<<br><br>No, with the wires that does not happen.  Also, because I treat the book as a throw away, I'm inclined to really use it rather than edit myself.  I'm not sure now if that aspect is so good.

I don't function when it comes to things I'm expected to do by the "system".  And that is just fine.  My wife asked me some computational problem yesterday (involving how many miles she rode and what her average was and how much she would have to make up to keep her projected average due to the rain delay, etc).  I just rolled up my eyes and computed it.  Now realize that arithmetic was my WORST experience in school.  No longer.  It is now a game with me.  I could not do it when I was expected ot mindlessly memorize "times tables" but when I do my wacko method, that no one else but me can follow, I get the answer in a jiffy.<br><br>I think it was Buckminster FUller who commented that if a child wants to color the sky green and the grass blue, let him be.

She wanted to see the new Harry Potter movie (very much darker than the rest, BTW) but the theater did not take Visa!!??!!??  So we gave them our debit card and they did not recognize our bank and would not take it?  Our bank is Bank of America, fer friggin' sake!  How could they not recognize that bank?  I'm really surprised that they did not want to be paid in gold nuggets, or doubloons, or pieces of eight, or something.  Rural America is really it's own country!</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>>>>  Mike, if I weren't NOT biking across PA right now I'd be pretty sure you were my husband under a different name. ;^)  <<<<br><br>ROTF ;-)  I turn to the broad view to understand such things.  My first question is always "How does this enhance the survival of the species?"  If you look at it that way, you'll see that species survival requires us "outliers".  Most of the herd has to be all the same.  They cope well in the status quo ... that is almost the definition of "status quo": "The stable environment in which most of the herd survives and prospers."  But for the herd to survive it must survive CHANGE.  And only the outliers will prosper under conditions of change.  So when things change, we will be the ones ready to cope and thrive ... and thus become the new herd, I guess ;-)  HUH?  NO!!! I don't WANT to be part of the herd ...  not even if the herd is built around me and my fellows ;-) ;-)</div>

In my new system I formalized almost that exact question in the process flow.  I made it part of the dismissal process to question how the task came about and if it should really be there at all.

I did not really "get it" until I started integrating all I know about time management systems and noticed that AF combined several distinct processes ... and those work at cross purposes if combined into one tool:<br><br>- Universal Capture (Grass Catcher)<br>- Planning<br>- Prioritizing<br>- Scheduling<br>- Execution (TO DO)<br><br>Now that I caught on to that (it now seems blatantly obvious) observation ;-)  I am in a position to rework (not tweak ;-) the system for my needs.

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>>>>  That's an excellent point. It is the "standing out" that is unique and there are a number of posts on this from the early days of AF1 Beta Testing. I think the problems come when one succombs to the pressure of the urgent and forgets to "trust the system".

Thanks for the reminder! :-)  <<<<br><br>My observations are much the same as to how things are working ... but I am coming down in the direction of the opposite reaction ;-)  I guess that I do NOT trust the system, and am not sure that I ever will ... or should.  Systems are our creations, products of our thinking, and to trust them but not our thinking is something of a contradiction.  I will trust a system under these conditions:<br><br>- I am sure that I have thought it through thoroughly,<br><br>- I have put in enough checks and balances so that I will hear sirens if there is a problem with it,<br><br>- It fits with my own personal thinking style.<br><br>The thing is that intuition is just the automation of thinking and if the thinking is not there, and correct, then the intuition will be faulty,  Intuition will lead to disaster if placed in the wrong context or if it is built on faulty thinking.</div>

I work in 3 basic modes.  1: reasonably and rationally willing  2. monkey mind mode and 3. donkey mode (I affectionately dubbed this mode: Stubborn Ass Syndrome<br><br>1.  Easy.....I simply do the stuff with appropriate pacing and breaks.<br>2.  Same as one but I'm on the alert to gently refocus my brain to my objectives.  My breaks might be short forays into monkey mind fodder........A timer is crucial!<br>3.  I break it down and impose a timer.  I reset it to a time that the donkey is willing to do.  If the short burst doesn't break the barrier, I simply rinse and repeat.  The short breaks are "less onerous work to sandwhich between the onerous short burst of the dreaded stuff.  I also negotiate a final STOP for the day time.  This promised sub-unit is NEVER more than two hours.  So Mr. donkey breath has his choice to either intersperse short timed bursts sandwhiched between the other tasks or to hold his nose and get it off his plate so that he can do the other stuff without the drag of dread polluting his mind.  <br><br>My dad used to always say,  "You can stop working when either you're finished or the sun sets, which ever comes first.  My sunset is 2 hours.<br><br>Sure, the donkey is the only real spammer in the works, but.....none the less, he has the power..........Even if I have to set the timer to only 5 minutes at a clip, EVENTUALLY one of  the 5 minute launches will catapault him over the hump. I also allow myself to chip away at the dreaded chunk of work on previous days to lower the 2 hour allotment of dreaded work.  <br>Sometimes the donkey's attitude actually facilitates my getting my other work out of the way while I'm sandwhiching it between rounds of chipping away at THE dreaded task of the day!  It's the same phenomenum as giving my flat the white glove treatment whilst meeting a dreaded deadline.  ROTFL!  In college we used to joke.....don't bother cleaning it today, it'll be spotless during exam week!  ROTFL  See? Even though the donkey can be seen as the weakest member of my "brain team", he also inspires the others via structured procrastination.......silver lining and all that.....<br><br>Re: your reply to Raner (yes, my nose sometimes sniffs outside it's proper boundaries...*blush*........................caution!!! Possible proselyizing message....<br>Mark's DIT book has a section (the best one!) called Commitment vs Interest.  It covers this brilliantly!  After all, our REASONS provide both our motives and our resistance!<br>My weekly DIT allows for both no nonsense working and flexibility to work out my foibles and to actually ENJOY the grand aspects of life.  I know that lots of people do brilliantly working within the Urgent zone for most of their work, but I don't like that.  For both my pleasures and my passions, I prefer a free mind without the drag of guilt polluting it.  It gives me a better atmosphere for both creativity and unfettered fun.  That's just me.<br>That's why I'm strict with the donkey and vigilant with the monkey.  The monkey is the silent star player.  I love him best of all when I don't need to get a PARTICULAR job done...The rest of the time, he's my muse!  ROTFL!<br>learning as I go<br></div>

As I have mentioned in previous posts, my list is very general (Clean, Organize, Blog, Video Projects, etc.). I then have associated lists that function much the way GTD lists do. So I have a list or cleaning tasks I'd like to get to, Blog ideas to write, etc. The exception that I make is I always add time-sensitive tasks to my main list. So I never stress out about getting to tasks on my clean list because the critical ones (like tasks to do before guests arrive) are on my main list.<br><br>The other thing you might try is to add the tasks, "Work on "on notice" task" and "Work on task on page X" where X is a middle page. This might provide more of the balance you are looking for. <br><br>I am not having trouble getting to my whole list because it is much, much shorter than it was--probably only 2 pages' worth or less. I also know, however, that we think and work much differently. You'd probably want to shoot yourself if you had to borrow my brain for a day. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I'm relatively new to Autofocus and to this thread, but have used both AF1 and AF2, and the following points strike me.<br>1. Neither system is perfect, and nor - brilliant though he is - is Mark.  So there's no reason why any of us shouldn't tailor either system for our own purposes if it doesn't work for us in Mark's version.<br>2. I'm surprised that Mark's paper didn't list as one of the differences between AF1 and AF2 the absolutely key point which is that you work from the front in AF1 and from the back in AF2.<br>3. The head tells us we should work from the front; the heart tells us we should work from the back.  Maybe both are right, and we should alternate between them.  You may be asking, "What about the stuff in the middle?"  Well, that will eventually move to the front, won't it?<br>4. I have an item in my AF list named "Daily list", which refers to a Word document in which I list all deadlined activities in ascending order of the deadline date, plus things that need to done on a daily or other recurring basis.  I then copy relevant items from the daily list to the end of the AF list.<br>5. I don't dismiss items at the front automatically.  If I don't think I should dismiss an item, I simply move it to the back.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br>Although I don't use AF, my system sounds remarkable similar to yours....which suits my weekly DIT hybrid.  Rather than transfer my deadlines, appointments and recurring work checklists (both one offs and batching), I simply work from the checklists and calendar along with my MITs.  It's simple.  All I have to do is make sure I follow it (sometimes that's the biggest challenge......My timer gets plenty of use as my taskmaster and work pacer. LOL!)  I keep to my assigned limits and work hours fairly closely.  The flexibility is built into it.  True, some things are non-negotiables, but other things can be done more ad hoc....With the weekly format, I rarely miss my aims for the week because it provides a combination of both regimentation and flexibility.  <br>Just out of curiosity, why do you bother to transfer this information to AF?  Does AF act as both a cueing device and a work pacer?  Sometimes I'll write a list if I need to do a lot and need both cueing and pacing.  Usually, not.  I've been with my little system for a long time so much of it is a rote practice.  I'll tweak it occasionally just to get over a hurdle or to freshen up my work perspective a bit.<br>Mark always encourages us to develop our own ways.  He's great at offering up many great ideas to test and/or tweak to integrate into our existing systems.  He's lead me to many great improvements over the years! Although the basics of my system remain solid, I'm open to testing for improvements (especially the distasteful, onerous, boring stuff ) Besides, it's fun to test and tweak ideas with the awful stuff to get it out of the way in a more pleasant manner!  *blush* <br>learning as I go<br></div>

There is no "wrong" STYLE of thinking.  We are who we are, after all.  There are PROBLEMS with how thinking is accomplished, however.  If you base your thinking on some invalid principles like WWDVD (What Would Darth Vader Do?) you are not going to live a very successful or happy life ;-)   This is an entirely different notion than one's thinking style.<br><br>Re: Gestalt Thinking.  That was actually someone else who introduced the term.  I think that Learning and I both went along with the idea that we think more "outside of the box".  I'm with her on the term "linear thinking".  I tend to go from A right to Z ... but then once I get there not happy until I fill in the missing pieces.  Over the years, I have built a certain amount of trust in my process in some areas.  But in new areas, I still need to go back and prove the validity of my intuition.<br><br>For example:  I know what my time management system needs to look like.  I knew it instantly once I vented here and got lots of comments.  I'm now in the process of "validating" what I know to be true.

<div class="content">Wooba,<br><br>If I had a project with 25 sub-tasks I would not add them all to AF2 at one time.  I might start with one or maybe a handful of concurrent tasks and go from there.  For example I might start with "Analyze and organize needs for project 1" and then when that task stands out, I would sit down and write out what I needed for project 1, either on regular paper for a separate folder, or in a text editor on my computer, or in mind map software.  I would then add one or at most a couple of "next actions" into AF2, probably in the form of "Contact Jim about Project 1" and "Research Web re: Project 1".  If the project is urgent, then the tasks will stand out.  As I cross out "next actions" I would just add more tasks, which keeps the project on the front burner.  If the project was due far in the future (more than a few weeks) and very important and time consuming, I would add a task like "Review Project 1" to remind myself to sit down with my project management system periodically and make sure I was adding the tasks that I needed to add to AF2 so that I was doing at least something on the project every day or so.</div>

<div class="content">Wooba, I recall Mark saying that AF2 would be much more "sensitive" with respect to "dumping".   And dumping tasks related  to a project you think you would resist is probably a double whammy.   Glad to see that you managed to get it all done!<br><br>Chris, I have done exactly what Wooba did and it has come out successfully - albeit using AF1, not AF2.  I don't want a bunch of ancillary lists and project pages with AF and only see the "project x" item occasionally - because that tends to slow down the progress of a project for me.  I want to have to make a decision or make some progress on that project every day if possible.  If it's something I'm really committed to doing, this works well because it pushes me to work on it at least "little and often".  And if I'm not really committed to doing it, it works well too because I can dismiss the whole brain dump.  <br><br></div>

However when I am planning something complicated, I do most of that work in a project folder or on my computer.  The tasks, however, are kept in AF.  I was just making this suggestion because of the sheer number of sub-tasks (25) he was working with.  I have never broken a project down to quite that level, even when I did GTD.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-20 20:08</div>
<div class="content">Jacqueline, I can see your concern with not working on your projects little and often by using an ancillary list. But my ancillary lists seem to have solved that problem for me. For example, I do not put "Unload dishwasher, sweep kitchen floor, etc." as individual tasks. I have an associated list of these tasks to do on a daily basis. I do them all (or most of them) when I come to CHORES on my AF2 list. In the same way, I have a Habit Focus list on my IPhone that lists how much time I need to spend on each of 5 habits related to my goals for the month. When I come to HABIT FOCUS on my AF2 list, I go to the app and check whether I've done these things today or not and if not, I will do them. My current set up is not to require completion of all 5 habits before checking it off my AF2 list. As a consequence, there is one habit in particular that I've let go. I may make a rule for myself to complete at least some time on each habit before checking it off AF2 and see if that helps or hurts. <br><br>What I have learned is that the more options I have in front of me at one time, the more overwhelmed I feel and the less I do. When I was listing projects, ideas, books to read, blog posts to write, countries to conquer ;-) on my AF1 list, the list kept growing and growing and I felt less and less in control. Now I feel okay even if I don't work the list much because I know the truly urgent tasks, including project tasks are right there on my short AF2 list that I see multiple times a day. I feel like I am finally realizing the benefits of even original AF that Mark intended: a list short enough to review and work multiple times a day.<br><br>The other benefit I have is more of a DIT time-to-process set-up. In other words, if I have an idea for a new blog post, I don't add it to my main AF2 list and start working on it right away. It gets added to my Blog Post Ideas ancillary list. As a result, it can simmer and I can determine if that's really a topic I want to devote time to. I am no longer sacrificing the important routine tasks for the more exciting creative tasks that I tend to get lost in. <br><br>Speaking of writing, how goes the novel writing?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-20 22:01</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>I hear what you're saying, but I seemed to run into problems in the early days of AF with putting bigger projects on the list.  I'd skip over those items time and again because I would see it as "RENOVATE LIBRARY" (hard) vs. "buy shelf supports for library shelves" (easy).  I think I would have to do it with almost everything like you have done to get it to work.  And you're electronic which makes that easier to do.  <br><br>Besides, with AF1, I don't have that many options really - I just have one page of options with maybe only 5-10 things on that page most times.  There's just 10-15 of those pages.  And you put ideas and possibilities on the list where I don't put anything that I'm not 95% committed to absolutely doing in the next couple of weeks / month.  eg. I have maximum ~ 2 books on the list to read at one time (and a full bookshelf of "to be read" in the future).  That translates to routine, everyday items plus one ~ 50 hour project.  That's it, that's all I can do.<br><br>With the important routine tasks, I figure if all I do is declutter, spend 15 minutes cleaning per day (often with the kids, so get done 3 times as much) using what's on my AF list or just focusing on the kitchen if I don't have the right mix of items on the list that day, do dishes and laundry daily (I am doing these as a morning habit along with lifting weights - which I also have limited to one body part per session to get into the groove again...), that's good enough.<br><br>With the writing, I am in the process of writing the scenes on index cards.  I'm trying to figure out a way I can dump that onto my list to force me to do the writing.  :-)   If I don't pick something off the list then, I'll have to dismiss the whole page, there's no way to avoid it.   <br><br>I've learned that I have to be quite specific in my writing of items to get stuff done so I have to use that m.o., but have a solid outline to make it work.  eg. "Declutter - 15 minutes" doesn't work on the list.  "Declutter box of kitchen junk in garage" does work.  "Write 400 words on Chapter 2" doesn't work.  "Write argument b/w X and Y over Z" does work.  Weird. <br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, I understand what you are saying and have experienced that issue as well. I broke tasks down a lot with AF1 to help me get things moving. It worked but produced a very large list. I<br><br> think my tasks are now SO broad that I don't feel the resistance anymore. In other words, one of the huge areas I was listing was organizing. I love to organize and every time I saw a closet, a cabinet, a computer file, you name it, "Organize X" went on my list. Well, I can't do all those organizing projects anytime soon and I never pre-screened them per a short time frame as you are doing. Now I have a list of 50 organizing projects I would like to do sometime. When I see the word Organize on my main list, I get kind of excited because I can go to the associated list and find something I really want to do. I am also dismissing the last project listed if I don't organize it the day I work the list. This works for me because I think I was spending way too much time organizing and way too little doing things that really matter to me. At my funeral, no one is going to ooh and aah over my alphabetized spice cabinet, right? <br><br>I'm glad you are figuring out a way of getting the book moving. Speaking of weight training, have you looked at Super Slow Weight Training? Apparently you do it less often than BFL (1-2 times per week) and it takes very little time as you lift and lower so slowly that you reach muscle failure within 5 reps. Sorry. OT, but had to ask.

I'm working out at home, so doing the one body part for ~ 8 minutes gives me my hour of training a week - works out perfectly!<br>I remember years ago doing Callanetics with my mom and now realize it probably hurt and was effective because you would go soooo slow.

<div class="content">psssssttttt.....Mike......confession:  I'm guilty as charged in a similar vein....  Sometimes I actually find myself reluctant to toss a page...then I kick my own butt...........toss it, airhead.  Unless it it belongs in the "proof" binder (read: cover my arse in case I'm threatened or accused of not paying.....)<br>GEEEESSSSHHHH....That list is crap that I'm going to do again and most of it is age sensative......What do I care if I washed the reds loads Tuesday and vacuumed the dog on Wednesday.......I'll be doing it again anyway!

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>That is pretty much how it goes.  I remember once I fussed because I had tossed a sheet with a phone number on it.  I realized that if I REALLY wanted the number, I could probably dig it out of the phone company documents I had on file.  And if it was a number 30 years old, who cares ... how many people still have the same phone number 30 years later.  And for those who do, there are lots of other tracks they've left by which I could find them.  If not ... so what?<br><br>One thing I have kept is the logs I used to keep at work when covering my ass big time.  Once in a long while I'll want to remember the name of the plumber I used to replace the water heater or something.  But eventually, they will also find their way to the community shred.  ;-)  I can always find another plumber.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>Yup....She's a German Shedder.....errrrrr.....German Shepherd!!!!  I vacuum both her and my floors 3 to 4 times a week.  I usually vacuum her out on the deck because I have to use a shedding rake and even the vacuum doesn't catch all of her fine, undercoat hairs.  Otherwise, I'd be living "fuzzy" as Mike puts it!  LOL!  (Why, I spend more time on her grooming than I do on my own!  Each session is usually about 30 minutes)<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>She sure is a wonderful dog......She's living on borrowed time.  13 years old!!!!!  She's never messed in the house, gone up on furniture, or stolen food.  I can leave a steak on the coffee table or bags of raw protein in the car......She never breaks the rules.  She leans into me so that I can get up leaning into her mighty shoulders.  When I can hardly walk, she slows down her pace.  The only trouble is that when I'm in high pain or medicated, she gets hyper alert.  She'll stand horizonally in my path to make me stop lest I become too vulnerable because another human being is approaching!  LOL!  She guards me like I'm the President!  ROTFL!  She's quite genial when she deems that I'm not in any present danger!  LOL!  I have no idea what she uses to guage her assumption that I'm in too much pain or too medicated to be safe around strangers!  ROTFL  I almost wish that we both die on the same breath.  I don't know what I'll do when she passes......<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning<br><br>She sounds amazing - isn't it incredible the way animals develop their senses of how we are?  I find it amazing that people cannot recognise that a pet becomes a part of the family as much as anyone else and how traumatic a loss is.  I do hope you will have many many more happy years together ........</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>If you liked Fred Hahn's book, I strongly suggest you buy the book titled "Body By Science" by McGuff and Little.<br><br>McGuff is an MD. I know that Eades is an MD and cowrote Hahn's book. But McGuff has devoted his life to this stuff. I felt that for Eades it was more of a drive-by journalism kind of assignment.<br><br><a href="http://www.bodybyscience.net/home.html/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybyscience.net/home.html/</a></div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>I know I'm still having a hard time adjusting to the loss of Thelma.  All I can suggest is that you get another puppy now, so the transition will be easier.  Also, the puppy will have a role model to help it learn the rules.  Probably get the same breed.  Those are very good and trustworthy dogs.  If I were to get a dog, it would probably be an Australian Sheep dog.  Those herding dogs are particularly easy to train and protective, so far as I know.<br><br>I had a friend who had an English Sheep dog and that thing was a stitch.  Every where I went it would block my way and try to herd me.  How funny.  Very friendly and docile.</div>

<div class="content">Hi moises,  <br><br>Yes, I totally agree with his philosophy!  I read Mike Mentzer's columns, Dorian Yates' training routines, etc. etc. but couldn't seem to make myself believe that it was possible to make significant strength gains with a small investment in time.  (Cuz that's not what Arnold and everyone else did!)<br><br>I used to work out about 15 hours a week - step aerobics, jogging and weights - and ate pretty high carb.  I would train hard enough that I would have difficulty driving my manual clutch, non-power steering car home from the gym, so I wasn't skimping in the intensity.  I was in very good shape, but I wonder if I hadn't overexercised and under-proteined myself how much better off I would have been.  I remember after a couple of months my BF% just wouldn't go down, which made no sense to me at all given that I was doing everything "right."  Sure...<br><br>The only thing that I'm doing differently than what he says below is working one body part a day for about 8 minutes of active lifting (not counting rests) and that I directly work my arms as well (because I enjoy it).  :-)  I'm not going full-out yet because I'm getting back into it and have hurt both my back and my rotator cuff in the past pushing myself past a certain point - the joints need to catch up to the muscle strength for me.  Having said that, I hurt them both on machines, not with free weights, so staying away from the machines and their possible unnatural range of motion may solve that problem.  I don't want to get sidelined right in the beginning though.<br><br>"So to any woman out there who is fed up with trying the same thing over and over, I offer this suggestion, instead of getting back on the treadmill “one more time,” try this: Alter your diet so that you eat no grain-based carbohydrate: no flour, no sugar, no bread, no pasta, and no high fructose corn syrup. Then go to the gym and perform a workout of leg press, pulldown, chest press, row and overhead press. Lift slowly and smoothly but with as much effort as possible. Go to complete fatigue, or as close to it as you can tolerate. Work out once, or at most, twice a week. Make sure your workouts last no longer than 20 minutes. Then sit back and watch what happens.

<div class="content">Moises, I had already gathered that the Body by Science book was the one to get from the Amazon reviews. Haven't started it yet, but I finished Hahn's book for kids. It's superb! As a homeschooler with five active boys, it's perfect for us. Actually, my dd loves to workout, too. <br><br>Jacqueline, you are so right about the diet. I made a lot of progress doing BFL but I would say most of it was in muscle gain. I started doing Feed the Muscle, Burn the Fat. Venuto discusses those who are "carb sensitive" there, but being completely addicted to fruit, I decided that wasn't me. :-) I've been on a no-grain diet for health reasons for 7.5 years. Since getting off the fruit, honey, and higher carb veggies several weeks ago, my body fat is the lowest it's ever been. The fringe benefit is that I'm healthier. What is amazing to me is that I kept jacking up the aerobics and cutting calories while leaving in the carbs. No matter how hard I worked, my weight and body fat stayed the same. Within a week and a half of cutting out fructose, I had lost 10 pounds. <br><br>Since discovering this key, I have also learned that high fructose intake is responsible for the IBS symptoms that so many suffer from. In fact, a low carb diet treats Crohn's disease, MS, and seizures amongst others. <br><br>Your practice of working just one body part is interesting. Hadn't thought of that. I would think you could just as easily do a lower/upper body split if you cared to work out more. My dh is like you. He is suspicious of working out too little. He's the type that does hundreds and hundreds of crunches. That just seems silly to me. lol I know Fred Hahn isn't a fan of aerobic exercise, but I have found that doing Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred and other short, high-intensity aerobics combined with light weights and high repetitions has dramatically improved my endurance and overall fitness. There has to be a balance in there somewhere. :-)<br><br>I'm now returning you to your regularly scheduled topical discussion. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mel, this IS about time management - how to get the most out of your exercise by putting in the least amount of time!!  Funny, I have one of Jillian Michaels' DVD's on my AF list to find - and 2 more coming in the mail.  I like doing a high intensity aerobic type of routine once or twice a week.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mel,.-)<br><br>I can't say enough good things about a low carb diet.  It is not for everyone, perhaps, but it is really for me.  I discovered this when Atkins was the craze.  I was skeptical but when Ornish outright attacked Atkins, even lying about what Atkins really was (he and others called it the "high fat" diet ... LOL ;-) I decided there must be something to it.  Leave it to my contrarian streak to get me to do things ;-)<br><br>So when this last visit to the doctor woke me up to serious problems on the horizon if I did not shed some pounds, get my blood pressure and chlorrestoral down, and exercise up ... I went strictly no carb.  WoooHooo, I can't describe the energy boost I experienced ... and the pounds just drop off.<br><br>Of course, what is largely missing from Atkins (at least as the dreamers read it ;-) is that one must STILL reduce calorie intake and increase exercise.  I mean, one can't simply gorge because there are no carbs in it ;-)<br><br>Anyway, as I tell my wife, tell me I have to diet by eating fillet mignon and I'm right on board with it ;-)<br><br>BTW, one thing I think that makes this work well, for me at least, is its simplicity.  It is instantly obvious what one can and can not eat.  Just no carbs!!!  (Well, it is just slightly more complex than that but if you reduced it to that simple rule you'd be 99% right.)  The people I've seen have trouble with it are those who try to game the system.  If you go to the support groups people are exchanging recipes for no carb chocolate pot pie and other such nonsense.  That is just masochism and accounts for their failure, I believe.</div>
