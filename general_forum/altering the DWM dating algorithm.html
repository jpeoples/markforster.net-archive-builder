<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I've been trying some "tweaks" to DWM.  <br><br>First, I very rarely get through my whole list, since I have hundreds of tasks on it.  So, my default behavior is now to look only at what's on the list for the next 7 days.  I can still look beyond that, cycling through all the pages up to Today+30, but I normally don't.  <br><br>But I CAN cycle through the first seven days pretty easily -- I get through it several times a day, as DWM is supposed to work.<br><br>I always start my day on Today+6 (which was yesterday's main re-entry point, at Today+7).  This is usually where I find my "most active" projects, and also the recurring items that need daily attention.  It is the best place for me to start, to make sure I see these active items.  <br><br>I also have been putting more thought into resetting the expiration date on unfinished and recurring tasks.  <br><br>For example, there are some tasks I may want to do more than once per day -- for these, I re-enter them at Today+7, as per the DWM rules.   <br><br>But there are other recurring items I don't want to see more than once per day -- so if I work on them, I re-enter them at Today+8, so they don't appear again till tomorrow (since I don't normally look past Today+7).<br><br>Also, there are some recurring items that I don't want to think about for at least a month, so I set the expiration date to Today+60 or something like that.  This effectively takes the place of my paper-based Tickler system.<br><br>For non-recurring tasks, such as project work, I may want to stop working for now, but possibly pick up again later that day.  So it gets re-entered at Today+7.  But sometimes I may say "that's enough for today" and re-enter at Today+8, so it doesn't show up again till tomorrow.  At other times I might say "that's enough for this *month*", so I re-enter at Today+30, or even Today+45 or something like that.<br><br><br>I don't even like calling these "tweaks" since they are fully in the spirit of DWM -- simply adjusting the dating algorithms to fit my particular needs.  It doesn't seem to affect the "dismissal" effect at all -- that still works great.  <br><br>Anyway, there had been speculation on the forum whether it would be "OK" to tweak the entry and re-entry dates.   I am finding that it's not only "OK", but makes the system work much better -- for me.  It helps me adjust my total workload -- that is really DWM's greatest strength -- enabling me to gauge how much is currently on my plate and how well I am keeping up with it.  These "adjustments" give me more flexibility to control what is on my plate.</div>

<div class="content">I think I do the same thing. Anything I enter beyond +30 doesn't even get looked at until the page it's on becomes the +30 page. Recurring tasks get re-entered on +7 or +30 depending on.... um, I'm not sure what LOL. I don't usually enter items on other pages but I don't have as many items to manage as you do.<br><br> I haven't noticed a problem either with entering items beyond +30 although I vaguely remember posts saying that wasn't a good idea but I don't remember when or shy.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster said it didn't work for him to set the expiration date on a task's deadline, say, for example, when the task is due at Today+15.   That suddenly broke the "closed list" effect.  Having only two pages as open lists (Today+7 and Today+1M) worked better for him.<br><br>For me, Today through Today+6 is my "closed list" and I don't really care whether the other dates are closed lists -- since I am not cycling through them every day.  So I have been experimenting with using the task's deadline for its expiration date, if it falls between Today+7 and Today+30.  So far it's worked just fine.<br><br>I don't remember any objections (from Mark, or anyone else) on setting the expiration date at something beyond Today+30.</div>
