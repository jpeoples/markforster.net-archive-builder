<div class="content">Hi,<br>Sorry I posted this in a reply earlier, but I thought I might get more responses by creating the post!<br>I've tried GTD then AF and now I'd like to stick with AF.<br>I have decided to keep 2 lists, one for work the other for home.<br>I tend to start each entry with the context like calls, wf, or the first name of my boss so I can quickly scan and find the items I need to discuss with him.<br>I carry a JR sized Levenger Circa foldover notebook which I love and I use it for my 2 lists as well as notes "on the fly"<br>I keep all "errands" in my Blackberry which is always with me, and I just use a legal pad at my desk for notes during my sales calls.<br>Any suggestions? Would you change anything?<br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Welcome to the forum Mitch!  AF is a flexible system that can be implemented in many ways.  Regardless of your apporach, it buys you: <br>* everything is captured<br>* you are constantly working on many things<br>* you are kept aware of things to work on<br>* you can't neglect things unintentionally.<br><br>Your approach above is perfectly valid.  It does suggest that GTD well ingrained in your brain.  That may be okay, but AutoFocus users tend not to emphasize contexts the way David Allen does.  Putting a context on all your tasks as you suggest and then doing the lot together may work.  [Anybody else tried this?  How'd it go?]  <br><br>Here's another way, not necessarily better:<br><br>My AF list consists of projects, tasks, things to think about, etc.  If there are a bunch of thing I want to do as a unit, there will only be one entry in AF for that bunch.  In AF I write "Meet with Boss to discuss stuff", and "go shopping".  Separately, I keep lists "To discuss with boss", "shopping list".   Because it's convenient, I might initially add "Buy Bread" to AF , but when I get around to processing that entry, I'll realize that's something I should move to the shopping list and do so.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, do you keep your lists in the same book as your AF list or elsewhere? If so where?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">I use MS OneNote rather than a physical book, so in my case it's easy to keep them together with hyperlinks, embedded pages, etc.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using AF4.  I have four or five major "contexts" which includes three different physical locations.  I've found it works best for me to have one notebook for everything.<br><br>When I'm working (either working from home, or at the office), I just skip over the personal tasks -- unless it's actually a small, pressing task that I can do while at work in good conscience, such as make a phone call to the mechanic or something.  If a larger personal task presents itself as REALLY needing to be done NOW, then maybe that means it's time for lunch break.  :-)<br><br>When it's quiet at home in the evening when the kids are in bed, I have some tasks like personal reading, discussing some things with my wife, and other things.  I just skip over the rest.<br><br>On the weekends, I skip over the work stuff and focus on the personal / family stuff.<br><br>It generally works really well.  It usually takes me a few days to get to the point where I go through my closed list and nothing wants to be done -- so the stuff that gets highlighted really does DESERVE to be highlighted.<br><br>If I find that stuff is getting highlighted that SHOULDN'T be getting highlighted, then that means my time is out of balance.   If the personal tasks are getting neglected, then maybe it means I am working too much overtime and need to pull back for a week or two.  Etc.<br><br>I also "tag" a few different kinds of items -- usually stuff to discuss with my wife.  I just put her name over on the right margin -- it's easier to find when scanning the pages.<br><br>I put shopping lists and things like that in the back of my AF book.  Let's say I think of something I need to get at the hardware store.  I'll add it to my hardware store list in the back of the book, and then I'll add "hardware store" to my AF list.   When I come across the task while processing AF, and it "feels ready", then I'll look on my calendar and make time for going to the hardware store.<br><br>Just some ideas -- the main thing is just stick with it and you'll eventually find a groove that works for you.   If some task or idea or goal arises and you just don't know what to do with it, just add it to the AF list and let it percolate for awhile till you figure out what to do with it.  That way nothing is ever lost.  <br><br>I really like that aspect of AF over GTD -- you aren't "allowed" to add something to GTD till you have figured out the "next action".  AF isn't so strict -- you can give it thoughts, ideas, partially thought out tasks, etc., and it will handle them all just fine.</div>

<div class="content">"Alan, do you keep your lists in the same book as your AF list or elsewhere? If so where?"<br><br>I'm not Alan, but I can address this because I handle bigger things in the same way that he does.<br><br>My AF book (just one) is a roughly 5x7 knock of Moleskine... for other lists (stuff to talk about at meetings, shopping lists, etc.) I keep scratch paper in the pocket of the AF book.  For journal-type stuff I also carry a pocket-sized notebook but the only things that go in there are things I want to keep long-term.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks both.  I like the idea of keeping some lists in the back of the AF book as it keeps everything in one place (especially when I travel occasionally and have time to do tasks when staying overnight in hotels). <br><br>I also like the idea of keeping some lists folded in the book - for example I have a project list for one customer which is quite detailed and which I have as a soft copy so I can share with that customer.  I can print this out and keep in my AF book as I have to work and make notes on it from time-to-time.</div>

AF's dismissal rules show you what goes wrong very fast, while with GTD it's possible to stay on the wrong track for a long time. In GTD there is no place for failure, AF allows you to learn from failure.</div>
