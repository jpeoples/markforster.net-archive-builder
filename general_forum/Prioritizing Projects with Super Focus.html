<div class="content">I've just experienced a strategy for handling high priority projects with Super Focus that I found very effective. I hope others will find it useful. In short:<br><br>1. Write each task associated with the project in your SuperFocus planner as you think of them<br>2. Create a reminder for when the project becomes urgent<br>3. When the reminder goes off, write down the task "next Project X task"<br>4. To action this task, go through your entire SuperFocus planner looking for the next Project X task that stands out. Cross it out and put it in column 2.<br>5. When the current Project X task is complete, repeat the process starting at step 4.<br><br>I had been writing down all the things that needed to be done for a project in my SuperFocus planner. The due date was several weeks into the future, so I would work on them whenever they stood out (which wasn't very often, since I had other priorities).<br><br>I also put a reminder that the project would become "urgent" a week or so before its due date. At this point I put the project title in my SuperFocus planner column 2. The activity associated with this was "find next project task". I then thumbed through all my active pages and selected the first activity associated with the project that stood out.<br><br>This task was worked on until it was completed, at which point I repeated the process, going through the list until I found a project item that stood out.<br><br>This allowed me to quickly and thoroughly finish the project with no motivation or procrastination problems, while still fulfilling my other daily duties. Before I had tried this I was concerned that the column two rule of SuperFocus would conflict with looking for through the project "subset" for the next task that needed to be done, but it didn't! By using column two this way, I was able to give my high priority project the time it needed.<br><br>It was also effective at discarding the things on the project that didn't really need to be done. These items didn't stand out as I went through the list looking for the next project item.</div>

<div class="content">Ryan, what interests me most about this is how you were able to "add" this "new feature" to SuperFocus without breaking the rules. I put those words in quotes because really the feature was there all along in Mark's rules, waiting to be discovered by someone sufficiently clever.<br><br>If you had suggested to me, "When a project becomes urgent, just flip through the whole book looking for its tasks, and do whichever one you want," I'd have replied, "That will probably work, but you're totally breaking the rules." Yet, all you had to do was enter your devious plan into C2, and just like that, it became legal!<br><br>Digital users will find this scheme especially powerful, since they can search the notebook instantly. It will help if they have consistently included a given project-related keyword in each task.<br><br>This means various ideas such as "ping-ponging" or flagging urgent tasks can be made legit. merely by writing the appropriate instruction into C2. For example, one could write "flag urgent tasks for next 2 days" in C2, and later on, "do one flagged task," or perhaps, "copy one flagged task into C2 below." After all, if we could have pulled these urgencies from any external reminder system—or indeed we could have pulled them out of thin air—then where is the harm in letting our very notebook hold them for us?<br><br>As long as we keep to the active page and continue following all rules about turning to the next active page, dismissing, etc., I don't see a problem.<br><br>Now, when I imagine using your strategy, I have to wonder whether I would tolerate flipping through all those pages. Would it feel too bothersome, looking for a needle in a haystack? Or, would it be perfectly nice? Would I overlook critical things while scanning past all those items? Would my eyes cross after the third page? As Mark often says, you can't know without actually trying it out.<br><br>Luckily, there is a very nice insurance policy: write in C1, "gather all tasks of urgent Project X into a separate list." If all this notebook-searching were to become oppressive, one would expect this C1 task to stand out, and you would end up transferring the project out of the notebook for more focused management.<br><br>But if the notebook-searching went on nicely, the C1 task would not stand out, and so you would press on, leaving well enough alone. Your project would get just the degree of management that it deserved.<br><br>Thanks for sharing that experience, Ryan.</div>

<div class="content">You're very welcome!<br><br>It was easy to find the tasks associated with the project since I had prefixed them with my project's Mnemonic. My current project is my Master's thesis, so all the tasks associated with that are prefixed with "Thesis:" or "T:"<br><br>For example, a page would look like:<br><br>T: write abstract<br>Pick up mail<br>Clean desk<br>Think about dinner recipes<br>T: read Jaynes paper<br>T: find papers ref. by Smith<br>...<br><br>I was able to skim effectively and find the tasks with the prefix set.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Ryan, that sounds like a good setup. I am currently thinking about the idea of having a second SF-List for my main project: working on my Bachelor's Thesis. <br><br>I think of always having "Working on Thesis" in C2 and then using a the second list with all my to-dos for my thesis and handling them the SuperFocus way. (I might use smaller paper to ensure a faster circulation).<br><br>If this results in too much resistance I might write "working for more than 25 minutes on Thesis" or something similar (Pomodoro like...).<br><br>This approach might also work for my working on my music recording. Usually every song is a very complex micro-project and I think it won't work to put specific tasks on the general SF list.<br>--<br>Edit: This might work too for batching tasks like phone calls. Instead of writing "call john" I might write "phone calls" and then use a second list with all waiting phone calls.</div>
