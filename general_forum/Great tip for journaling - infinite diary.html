<div class="content">I have just seen a TV document about somebody from 1930`s. He had very interesting journal, it was typical large format page-per-day diary, except that  there was several "19.." preprinted on each page. Like:<br><br>4th July<br><br>19..<br>-<br>-<br>19..<br>-<br>-<br>19..<br>-<br>-<br><br>After some confusion I realized that this journal could be written for many years. E.g. on 4th July 1931 he wrote down today note and filled "1931" (current year) above this paragraph. Next day he continued on next page. However next year, he started from the beginning of the journal, so on 4th July 1932, he made new note on the same page as last year, together with "1932" note. <br><br>That impressed me - what a wonderful way how to assure one of the most important function of journal: compare what happened before, be aware how you developed, what repeats, what changed, what are persisting themes in your life etc. Maybe you know it but it was great idea for me. What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">I just forgot to mention that this idea can be also implemented very easily in electronic way - in OneNote, MacJournal, Evernote etc. So you could really have infinite journal.</div>

<div class="content">Both 5-year and 10-year journals such as you describe are available in the US from Levenger.com.  Pricey but cool.</div>

<div class="content">The Journal 10+ is based on the same concept:<br><a href="http://stores.journal10.com/StoreFront.bok" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://stores.journal10.com/StoreFront.bok</a><br><br>But I really like the idea of using a standard page-a-day journal instead.  The regimentation of the Journal 10+ always seems to hold me back.   Maybe I'll try something like the notebook I use for DIT - the messier, the better.   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/886613113X" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/886613113X</a></div>

<div class="content">I started a 5 year diary this year for my positive / gratitude journal. I hope next year I will get the double benefit of thinking positively and reading about what I was grateful for the previous year.<br><br>I'm using a standard bought 5 year diary is <a href="http://www.letts.co.uk/breast-cancer-campaign-a5-day-to-page-five-year-diary.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.letts.co.uk/breast-cancer-campaign-a5-day-to-page-five-year-diary.html</a> <br><br>I like the idea of using a standard book as you can vary how much you write each day, however my head is happier having a line under each year so I can follow the year easily through the book.</div>
