<div class="content">I just wanted to thank Mark for continuing to tinker. I tried diligently to get AF1 to work for me, but it never quite did.  I hardly got interested in AF2. But RAF is working great for me.  Thus far, I have only implemented my RAF notebook for office work but I have found a marked reduction in notebook avoidance.  In the previous iterations, I avoided my notebook for fear that by opening it I was committing to either do or dismiss something.  Now, with RAF, if nothing stands out, I can just shut the book and go play.  Likewise, "change to forward mode" may not stand out for days on end.  With RAF, I find it much easier to open the notebook and get something done, instead of avoiding my notebook altogether.  Thanks again.</div>
