<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-14 14:05</div>
<div class="content">I think I have found my way of using AF2 now.<br>I have MLO (Mylife Organized) where I keep ALL my 'stuff', in a secure way, if you think GTD. It is categorized in different contexts, and I use it to find new items to put in my active list.<br><br>But I have found that Autofocus2 really makes a difference when it comes to selecting what to do during the day.<br>I started with a new list, not the huge archive of historic ideas.<br>But I use the contexts in MLO, e.g. AF2. I have then created a list with only these items, and that is the list I use daily now. New ideas are added with the rapid parser in MLO, and they automatically get the context 'AF2', so they appear on my list at once.<br><br>I am using AF2 the other way around, i.e. I have sorted my list with newst items at the top, so I read the list from top to bottom. It's much more natural for me, instead of going down to the last screen and reading backwards.<br><br>When I have done some work on an item, I just duplicate it (Ctrl-D), and tick off the active one. The new one immediately gets to the top (the bottom in original AF2). Then I go back to the top of my list, see the new item, but probably will find another task that is 'sticking out'. (If it was finsihed, I just tick it off, and it will be marked struck out in my list.)<br><br>About dismissal: Every day I look at the bottom, to find the last item i worked on. I then set a yellow flag on the last ones  NOT worked on. The next day I take the decision if the flagged items should be done anything with, in that case I remove the flag, and get it done (or work for a while, and duplicate it to continue later as described above).<br><br>If I decide to really dismiss it, I just remove the AF2 tag/context from the task, and it is not on my list anymore. (But the advantage for me is that it is still in my MLO 'safe'. I know I will find it there if/when I need it later.)<br><br>I now and then do a review of my archive, and if I find something I want to work with, I set the AF2 context again, and then it is back on my working list!)<br><br>I have also added another tag/context: waiting_for. When I can't do anything more for the task unitl I get some material, or input from someone else, I add this tag. Then with MLO's automatic formatting, I get a blue flag on the line, so I easlily can see that this is in a waiting state, and I can skip it for now.<br><br>For me, I now have the perfect combination of GTD and AF2. The problem with GTD of selecting what to do is now brilliantly handled by AF2.<br><br>The problem (uneasy feeling) with AF2's dismissal is not a problem any more. I know I still have it tucked away in a safe place.<br>And I benefit from the advantage of really dismissing tasks (e.g. if I was too optimistic when I entered an idea on the AF2 list, or if the task for some reason could not be done just now). The active AF2 list is really active, and I have noticed that I really get some things done now.<br><br>Thank you, Mark, for sharing your ideas. I am sorry about some tweaking, i.e. resorting top-bottom. That doesn't really change the idea of AF2 at all, but it is much easier and more natural for me to use the list in that direction.<br>AF2 ideas has really helped me!</div>

<div class="content">Jabbe, I use the same procedure in Listomni. It's a fantastic approach! I am trying out Google tasks at the moment, but my basic AF2 approach is not changing.</div>

<div class="content">I've been talking to Andrey (ie brainwashing him) about implementing an AF/AF2 application for windows and the iphone. You post makes me thing that maybe an AF/AF2 mode for MLO and the new iMLO application, would be more appropriate maybe toggled with a key that replace the computed score algorithm with an AF2 algorithm... hmmmmm</div>

<div class="content">Jabbe,<br>thanks for your detailed description. I also use MLO but struggled with a serious AF2 setup - so I switch to the Excel Solution mentioned in this forum. I will give your solution a try.<br><br>One question: As far as I see, you can (only) duplicate a task in the outline view. So, do you switch from ToDo to Outline if you want to reenter a task? Or is there a trick I missed?</div>

<div class="content">Jens,<br>it works fine with Ctrl-d also in To-Do view.<br>Ctrl-d to duplicate, and Spacebar to mark as done. Easy ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I have MLO but I have moved away from using it once AF was born -- due to AF1's page constraints. <br><br>Jabbe,<br>Your post piqued my interest in using MLO again. I am assuming you are using the Hierarchical Priority to order the to-do list. Are you ordering the list by creation date? Can you or anyone using MLO for AF1 or AF2 explain their setup in detail? Thank you.<br><br>GC<br></div>

<div class="content">About MLO setup: I use Advanced filtering for a view I called Autofocus2:<br>contexts contains (AF2)<br>Sort.. by Created date / Descending<br><br>I also added an Automatic formatting rule: WF: Rule; contexts contains (Waiting) and Icon (use icon ticked) Bullet blue.<br>This is just to give a special indication for items where I added context=Waiting<br><br>That's it.<br><br>When one task is ready, I press spacebar, and it is struck-through.<br>If I want to continue on it, I first use Ctrl-d to duplicate, and it is repeated at the top of my list.<br><br>Shift-Ctrl-M is used to start Rapid task Entry. I have chosen a folder which is setup with the context AF2.<br>I enter as many items I want, one line for each, press Enter - and they are automatically added to (the top of) my Autofocus2 view.<br><br>Much of this requires version 3 of MLO.</div>

<div class="content">You're welcome. <br>I also read over at MLO that they are working on a template for AF2, so I may not be the only one to see the advantages.</div>

<div class="content">I havé tried to use omnifocus and gtd in the way explained avive but ut did not work. I dont know why. I guess than Béring toi rigourous create a réal bug in thé efficiency. I returned back to a strict GTD exept for thé inbox list which is treated in thé of way. I kept thé double reading and it works for me. I learned a lot with this bas expérience wich taught me that trying to be perfect is unproductive for me. Best to all</div>
