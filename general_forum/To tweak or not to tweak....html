<div class="content">...that's not the question at all with AF ;)<br><br>As opposed to some other systems (most notably GTD), which seem to invite tweaking, I feel this is not at all the case with AF. In fact, after working the system for a few weeks following the basic initial instructions, I notoced that I simply don't want to change anything. The desire is simply not there. I just work the system, get lots more done than ever before, and am happy.<br><br>I just wanted to share this observation...</div>

<div class="content">I've just added a few lists to my notebook, one of them is "Best moments with AF"!</div>

<div class="content">Marc:<br><br>I agree with you. I have experimented with various changes and modifications to the system over the last month - and every time I come back to the exact system as given in the instructions.</div>

<div class="content">I concur, Mark.  The only tweak I tried was a brief online version, but the satisfaction of physically crossing something off my list was too great!  I like the system as is.  Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">I have longer update post I am drafting for later, but so far the only Tweak I can see is using the W for waiting for items instead of rewriting forward and using the last page as a place to park someday maybe type items.  This is only because I am obsessed with as few tools as possible.  It is probably just as AF to make a someday maybe file and put Review someday maybe file into AF from time to time and add those things that you now want to do to the list.<br><br>Quite honestly the Tweak is with my mind to keep reminding myself to "live" in my notebook.<br><br>Gerry</div>
