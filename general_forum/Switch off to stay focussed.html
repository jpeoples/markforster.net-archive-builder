<div class="content">Hi all, my first post in the forums (I've posted in the blog comments with SF3 explanations a couple of times).  I'm using SF3 as a portable electronic implementation using the excellent freeware TreePad Lite.  I'll post in more detail about that soon.<br><br>I saw this article which I think will be of interest to others.  Ultimately, to get things done, you have to do them and that means not being distracted by other things.  Between our computers and our phones we're in a constant state of online distraction.<br><br><a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/writer-urges-internet-junkies-switch-off-think-064124762.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ca.news.yahoo.com/writer-urges-internet-junkies-switch-off-think-064124762.html</a><br><br>I like to do long distance walking and I think it's the isolation I enjoy.  Same on holiday - I like to be incommunicado, it's very liberating!  So maybe switch the router off, close down your apps, pull up your tasks in SF and get stuck in to the ones that don't need connectivity!  Give it a go - does it make a difference?</div>

<div class="content">Welcome!  I also like walking, and our gracious host does as well.  I think you are very right about turning off the distractions.  I think I shall close this browser now. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Yes Welcome ! Since a month ago I was running twice a week,no I ride my bycilcle and switch of every kind of electronic such as my mac, my ipad, my Mac. <br><br>I recognize all these electronic tools I made for my job help me a lot on the control but I also noticed a lose of concentration and cogito since I switched a lot from paper to computer. <br><br>It is really a problem because the information increased much and much and for dealing with it we put much and much of technology. <br><br>I think we are wrong the problem is not the amount of information but it selection. <br>Less they are left easier it is to deal with. <br>That's my opinion. <br><br>I think the key of time management is there.</div>

<div class="content">"the problem is not the amount of information but it selection"<br><br>Good point, Jupiter.  We tend to not realise what we do to ourselves sometimes that hinder our ability to concentrate properly.</div>
