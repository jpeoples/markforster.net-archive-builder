<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">It's very difficult to run a marathon.  Besides the physical effort, it can be boring.  3 hours is a long time to pursue a strenuous goal without wavering.  This is especially true when you are in less than ideal shape.  In fact, marathoners don't focus on the finish line at the beginning of the race, they set smaller goals.  <br><br>So when I ran Hamilton's "30K around the Bay" race, I had a plan: Run 5K, walk 1K, repeat 5 times.  Running 5K is a lengthy but doable goal.  But within each 5K, especially the later ones when I was tiring, I set myself micro goals: reach the kilometer marker, run the next kilometer faster (or slower), get to the bridge, climb that hill, see what's around the corner, catch that pack.  These micro goals keep the race interesting, keep my mind off the fact that 4K more is a long way to go, and fill the race with mini-successes.<br><br>So apply the same thing to working.  nuntym wrote of boredom with AF4.3T in the "Time based systems" thread.  I was struggling with boredom too, and largely due to having big projects that never seemed to progress.  Mark's 3T system demands well-defined goals, and My System seems to appreciate those better as well.  But with big projects, setting a series of 2 to 20min micro goals keeps things interesting.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Alan, I think I have been doing that unconsciously with my implementation of 3TS.  Whenever I am about to add a decidedly long project into the 3TS I add a colon and a smaller goal beside it.  Therefore, I change<br><br>     > Read Pride and Prejudice<br><br>into<br><br>     > Read Pride and Prejudice: finish chapter 1<br><br>After finishing the task, cross it out and rewrite as<br><br>      > Read Pride and Prejudice<br><br>and repeat when I am about to do it again.<br><br>So far it's been working well for me.<br><br>I think the principle behind this can be explained by one of the articles written by Mark a year ago, "Keeping one's markers aligned,"<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/1/keeping-ones-markers-aligned.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/1/keeping-ones-markers-aligned.html</a><br><br>Anyways, I think this will work out pretty well for your system.  As far as I understand, you have separate project files, right? So what if, when you add a project into your system's Focus part, you look into its project file, pick out one or a couple of mini goals, and add it/them beside the item?<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">And I've been doing the same thing, in toodledo, using subtasks to create my microtasks. <br><br>I've been using Toodledo to do AF4 along with DWM simultaneously (reviewing tasks created > 30 days or modified greater than 7 days them along with any pass on the closed list where nothing happens). The triple task addition has been easy to implement and very helpful in focusing my attention on the tasks that really must get done.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps I wasn't clear enough.  I agree with and do everything you both wrote (except the DWM part).<br><br>I'm actually talking about another level here.<br><br>Run marathon -> run 5K -> run to distant corner<br>Write Prejudice and Pride -> write chapter 1 -> draft page 1<br>Clean house -> clean room -> pick clothes off floor so I can vacuum<br><br>That last item is a micro-goal.  It's done very quickly.  It is not a 3-T task, it's not on my Focus list, and quite possibly isn't written down.  It's a thought that engages you and overcomes the anxiety of the mini goal, especially when that goal is complicated, tedious, or difficult.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I cannot see anything that will make it not work, Alan.  In fact I think the more you finish the micro-goals the more you'll be motivated to finish the mini-goals which will motivate you to finish the whole goal ^___^<br><br>If you are trialling this, then keep us posted on the results.<br><br>God bless you and your efforts.</div>

<div class="content">In fact it's so basic it doesn't need me testing.  It goes like this:<br><br>1 Work starts to drag. <br>2 I imagine a microgoal for the current action that takes few minutes. <br>3 I do it.<br><br>That's it.  Or in place of 3 I take a break ( do another thing ) for a while. <br>When I get back, it will be easy to pick up. <br><br>Sometimes I list out several microgoals as a checklist and do them in sequence.</div>

<div class="content">"get the file out" is an excellent micro goal to get started. The technique is also good in the middle of working when you get stagnated. Think of turning the work into a game with points.</div>

<div class="content">A micro goal is also good when you are ready to quit something.  When you tire of running, or of working on the project, set just one more goal like "stop at 35 minutes, but run it strong" or "wrap up this page" and then cruise to your new finish line.  Sometimes you'll find a little more energy to do just a bit more, and leave the project satisfied.</div>

<div class="content">Aren't Micro Goals just the same as GTD's "Next Action" ?</div>

<div class="content">As someone with ADHD, "just get the file out" has helped me enormously over the years. There is always a huge hump to get over in starting anything, and if you can just get over the hump of the first micro-action, you are often able to continue quite easily. Mark, this was one of your truly great posts.<br><br>@Frank: I think Next Actions and Micro Goals could be the same, except that the former is tied to a specific system and the latter is more generic. But where they could be different is that a Micro Goal is as tiny as it needs to be to get you motivated. GTD would also permit this, of course, but the focus of the two terms is different, I think.</div>
