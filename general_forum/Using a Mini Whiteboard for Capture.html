<div class="content">Has anybody tried using a mini whiteboard like this one?<br><a href="http://www.scribbledirect.com/en/childrens-whiteboards/mini-double-sided-hand-held-whiteboard-in-green.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribbledirect.com/en/childrens-whiteboards/mini-double-sided-hand-held-whiteboard-in-green.html</a><br><br>I got one recently and have been using it for the following:<br>- making notes of interruptions while you are working<br>- dynamic lists<br>- reminders<br>- ideas<br>- brainstorms<br>- current tasks<br><br>I've noticed the following advantages:<br>- I have to deal with what's on the board quite quickly otherwise it gets full!<br>- Because what's written on there is only temporary I don't feel as committed to doing it, so will add anything I can think of without feeling the pressure to do it<br>- I am free to 'make mistakes' or write a load of rubbish because it's easy to just rub it out and start again!</div>

<div class="content">I found the same thing, using my whiteboard at work for 5T and dynamic lists!<br><br>I liked it so much, I bought this little whiteboard to use at home:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Markers-Erasers-Mounting-DiamondTab/dp/B0199EMQ7C" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Markers-Erasers-Mounting-DiamondTab/dp/B0199EMQ7C</a><br><br>I just keep it propped up against the wall at the edge of my desk at home.  I can take it wherever I want.<br><br>Just like you wrote, it's great for:<br>- limiting WIP  (can't write too much there - not enough room!)<br>- easy to change<br>- completely erasing tasks when done is even more satisfying than crossing them out LOL<br>- completely erasing the whole board when it feels irrelevant is also satisfying<br>- NOT having a written log of tasks feels liberating and keeps things alive.  There is no feeling of obligation to go back and scan the list for anything I may have forgotten to do.<br><br>In fact, this led me to try an experiment.   Quite often, when I write down my 5 tasks for 5T, and then go work 1 task, when I return to my 5T list, it already feels "stale".   Even though there are only 4 tasks there, it still generates some resistance!   Like looking at my FVP or AF1 list and seeing all these things I need to do!   <br><br>So I've been experimenting with this:  I write down my 5 tasks, then choose ONE task to work on, and erase all the rest!   Then when I'm done, write down 5 tasks again, choose ONE to work on, and erase all the rest!    Sometimes, this seems to work as well, or even better, than simple 5T.   It also works better (for me at least) than writing down just ONE task and then working on it.  It allows me to brainstorm a little -- even just for 30 seconds -- which helps me ensure that I'm getting everything on my mind, down onto the whiteboard.   I find myself THINKING more and ENGAGING more, rather than just working through a list.   And I also find myself more aware of all these things that I'm repeatedly writing down -- it seems my mind is processing them unconsciously or something.<br><br>Anyway, it just proves that Mark's systems are not just about productivity and getting things done, but about coming to understand one's own psychology and motivations.  Mark, maybe you can work that into the title of your next book somehow.  :-)</div>
