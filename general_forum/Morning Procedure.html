<div class="content">I've written out the steps needed each morning as an aide memoire.  I'm sure after a few weeks I won't need this but here it is:<br><br>1. Highlight yesterday's unactioned tasks on notice<br>2. Draw a line below task(s) on notice for review<br>3. Date tasks actioned yesterday<br>4. Record today's date<br>5. Delete and re-enter "change to forward mode" if not actioned yesterday<br>6. Start in reverse mode<br><br>The system is working like a dream after day one.  I'm getting so much done.</div>

<div class="content">Man of Kent,<br><br>Thank you, it looks good, and its nice to see it written out as a list.<br><br>Regarding reentering "Change to Forward Mode (FM)" at the end of the list each morning. . . is that somewhat of an anomaly regarding how things are moved around the list? It hasn't been actioned, and it hasn't been put on review. . . it seems it is just getting cherry picked from the list, deleted, and moved to the end.<br><br>I didn't notice this point in the official rules write up. I'm aware of some discussion that the *way* its supposed to work is that "change to forward mode" should be at the end of the list. . . and this might often be accomplished naturally if one switched to FM recently (because then it would be deleted and reentered at the end). But what if one has NOT switched to FM recently (or at all!)?<br><br>One of the marks of the Autofocus system seems to be a consistent application of the rules, with few exceptions to them. Would the reentering of "Change to FM" be the (only?) example of an exception?<br><br>I'd be very interested in what everyone thinks.<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Joseph:<br><br>I included this bit about deleted and re-entering the "change" task in my original "AF1/AF2" switch instructions , but left it out of the Revised Autofocus instructions. The reason for including it was so that the switch didn't get too inaccessible. I left it out of the combined instructions because I wanted to keep them as simple as possible.<br><br>It's certainly a perfectly acceptable alternative in my view.</div>

<div class="content">Mr. Forster,<br><br>Thank you. I understand the tension between anticipating issues (and including rules to deal with them) and the desire for simplicity in the rules. I think you've navigated that admirably.<br><br>While we are on the subject of switching, and how "switch to X" is entered on the list, may I ask about the reasoning behind having "switch to FM" on the list? Is it because the switch is such an individual and intuitive process and these types of things really benefit from being on an AF list?<br><br>Did you consider not having "switch to FM" as an item on the list, but rather just as a rule of the system. . . i.e switch to FM whenever you feel the need to take a look at the beginning of the list? I'm curious about its development, because it might help me understand how to properly implement it.<br><br>Thanks!<br>--Joseph<br><br></div>
