<div class="content">I stumbled across a piece of software entitled: Opus Domini. It was mentioned in the "The Hit List" Google group. <br><br>As previous mentioned, 7 Habits had a huge impact on my personal and professional life in 2001. However using PlanPlus soured the entire experience, causing me to look elsewhere (GTD --> AF --> GSD --> DWM --> etc., etc). Until this morning, I never thought I'd return to the 7 Habits methodology... I'm now reconsidering. <br><br>MAS Link - <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opus-domini/id416244215?mt=12" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opus-domini/id416244215?mt=12</a><br>Website - <a href="http://www.piso13.com/Piso13/Opus_Domini.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.piso13.com/Piso13/Opus_Domini.html</a></div>

<div class="content">I was surprised to find that this is a free download. It has a very pretty, simple, paper-like interface, complete with animated page flips that you can hear. It automatically copies iCal events into the calendar, which is nice. Not sure I'll use it, but the price is right!</div>

<div class="content">I like 7 Habits the book, but not the ABC123 system.  I haven't really learned the system but my impression is the "low value" stuff never gets done, and that's not right.  See this sites Home page for why.<br><br>For SF, I like to put some A1 in column 2 and get it going.  I also like to add random tasks to review commitments and be sure the important stuff is properly in there.</div>

<div class="content"><<I like 7 Habits the book, but not the ABC123 system>><br><br>Agreed - that type of organizing never worked for me. <br><br><<but my impression is the "low value" stuff never gets done, and that's not right>><br><br>That's assuming that "low value" or "high value" stuff only get done when there's a system in place. Which clearly is not the case. <br><br>Where 7 Habits shines - particularly Habit 3 "Put 1st things 1st" & Habit 7 "Sharpen the Saw" - is in the weekly planning process. <br><br>But most importantly, as a Family Systems*** therapist & (somewhat) practicing Jew, the underbelly of 7 Habits supports my values. <br><br>*** Dr. Murray Bowen - founder of Family Systems therapy - stated it was a goal for every adult to differentiate Self i.e. become clear on your principles, and take daily actions on those principles. I've often wondered if Dr. Bowen & Dr. Covey knew each other.</div>
