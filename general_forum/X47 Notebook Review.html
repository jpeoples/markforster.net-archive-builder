<div class="content">I posted a review of the X47 notebook system, which I just received in the mail from Germany this past Tuesday, on my blog at <a href="http://opensourcetogo.blogspot.com/2009/03/notebook-pr0n.html" rel="nofollow">http://opensourcetogo.blogspot.com/2009/03/notebook-pr0n.html</a><br><br>I've got a bunch of photos, but, in short, it's a terrific system if you don't mind the cost. The cheaper version, the X17, seems quite usable as well...</div>

<div class="content">Great blog post Lefty!  The planner is a thing of beauty and I can see the features better from your blog than I could from the website.  I applaud you for having the perserverance to navigate the website.  I gave up on it after 15 minutes of not knowing where to click.  <br>I decided that having the prettiest notebook really wouldn't make ME more productive - I tried that with the $250 leather Franklin binder and never used it properly so I'm a little gun shy since now after over 10 years of keeping it in a box, I'm going to declutter it.<br></div>
