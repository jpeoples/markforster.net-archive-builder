<div class="content">Mark and All,<br><br>I am now a convert and finding AF to be outstanding -- a perfect blend of flexibility and yet the structure that I need.  I plan on writing a detailed description of how this is working in my world as a professor of microbiology at a major research university in the USA.  As many of you have seen from my previous posts, I have a 65+ hour a week job that is taxing at best.  Suffice it to say now that this new system is weathering my workload in a grand style!  <br><br>Stay tuned for more later...<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>I am interested in more details regarding your usage of AF, especially how you use it in an organizational setting. I like AF's simplicity and I've adapted it quite well into my life as an IT manager for a healthcare organization. I look forward to seeing how AF handles a month's worth of work.<br><br>My personal account is documented in the following post:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623632" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623632</a><br><br>Best regards,<br>Cliff</div>
