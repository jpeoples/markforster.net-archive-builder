<div class="content">For the past few years, I've been tinkering w/ different ways to reverse engineer a flowchart or mindmap. To start w/ a blank page, and tell a story via thoughts, next actions, frustrations, lessons learned, while working towards a goal, project outcome, etc. To that end, I've created a worksheet, some basic symbols, and now looking for some real time feedback. I'd be willing to provide some basic coaching (how and whys of using this system) in return for some feedback. <br><br>If interested, please send me an email at: avrum AT nadigel DOT com<br><br>Thanks.</div>
