<div class="meta">2017-10-15 21:28</div>
<div class="content">Hi Everyone,<br><br>I have been so happy with an ad-hoc system I have been using for as long as RAF has been out, that I had to share.  I call it Random RAF.<br><br>I use a paper notebook as a catch-all list and I add a line with today's date. I use a randomizer that (as Mark recommends) has a max of the number of lines on a page. Then as you do in Mark's random system, you start at the first page and use the randomizer to pick the line the task is on. When you land on a task, you have three options, Do, Defer, or Delete. You must do one of those things. When done, cross out, add to teh end of the book if needed and continue from where you left off. When you reach the end of the book, you go back to the start. Crossed out items are "slides" which mean that the odds of doing earlier items are greater than later ones.<br><br>Why do I call this Random RAF? Aside from stealing the Do, Defer, Delete rule. I have one more rule, I do not leave my work until the day before yesterday is completely crossed out. But I have found I don't need to do it as a block or stop the randomizer because of the slide, those items get addressed a little faster than other items, and I have almost always cleared out that day during the course of my workday. On days where I have many meetings, that page may linger a day, but likely there will only be a few items not hit by the randomizer.<br><br>That's the whole system. I played with notation for must do today items, but I find it is not necessary, if the randomizer does't hit a priority item, I see them as I count down the lines on a page and do them when needed. <br><br>This balances everything I need in a system, enough structure, but unstructured, a system to keep the list manageable, and a  guarantee that items I don't want to get done or are important but not urgent will get addressed in short time.  I've tried the simple scanning ideas, but honestly, when I want to work I often get decision paralysis. Here I just look at one item at at time (picked randomly) and say, yes, now, no later, or no, never, freeing up my decision and scanning time to just do or no do.<br><br>Works for me!</div>

<div class="content">I find this approach works fine, but skip the dice.  Just do an AF1 scan and pick anything that stands out to Delete or Defer.  If none, change the question to Do.  Carry on!</div>

<div class="content">The thing about the dice though is that it can remove/diminish resistance so I can see the usefulness of that.</div>

<div class="content">Here is my nascent theory on why randomizing is often superior to "standing out".<br><br>For decisions that matter, there is something about the random selection that triggers a faster, deeper intuitive response even than the "standing out" process. I think this is partially explained by the phenomenon of "revealed preferences" in relation to "flipism" -- see here for more -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipism#Flipism_in_decision-making" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipism#Flipism_in_decision-making</a><br><br>In other words, as soon as the coin toss reveals the decision, you know intuitively and blindingly fast if it's the wrong decision. It makes the right decision "jump out".<br><br>But I think there's an even deeper reason explaining how randomized methods make resistance disappear. *** For most tasks, priority really doesn't matter. ***  Trying to choose the right priority is usually trying to be more accurate than the noise.  It doesn't matter.  Any time spent on prioritization is wasted time -- except for the few decisions and tasks that really matter.<br><br>If priority doesn't matter, then ANY process, including the "standing out" method, that introduces prioritization overhead for every task, introduces waste and resistance into the system.<br><br>Taken together, it works really well:<br>(1) If randomizer chooses the wrong thing, you know it immediately, and can just go do the right thing.<br>(2) Otherwise just do what randomizer tells you to do. Better yet - defer, delete, or do. This gives you the flexibility to defer tasks that aren't ready for some reason; delete tasks that don't matter any more; and do.<br><br>So I am really interested in giving vegheadjones' new system a good try. But I'm currently doing something else with no-list that has similar effects. :-)</div>

<div class="content">This is it. I don't know why I didn't think of it before - the DDD really is helping keep the list to a manageable size and I have always loved the Random method. I find when I fully "engage" in the random method I'm automatically fully engaged in whatever task I'm working on. I've already seen an increase in the quality of my work and a decrease in stress. In the past when I used the random method, resistance would slowly build up because I didn't have the option to delete or defer tasks. I think this small combination of RAF and random will be wonderful. Thank for the insight, Vegheadjones! Seraphim, interested in your no-list system as well.</div>

<div class="content">I think you are dead-on Seraphim with your post.  Prioritization is an extra layer of stress.  And I am the same way Paul, when I use the randomized and do, I am more engaged.</div>

<div class="content">Basically I've been using no-list for getting started on the right things for the day -- zeroing in on the top two or three things that really matter. <br><br>(I don't think the particular mechanics make any difference -- any no-list system will do. The point is to rely on your intuition -- you already know what you need to do, just give it a few moments' reflection before firing up the calendar and email and reminders etc. and getting sucked into the void.)<br><br>But then, when I would get tired, or interrupted, or distracted, and my intuition isn't working very well, I would do things like email, clearing reminders, clearing out action items from my meeting minutes in OneNote, and any other odds and ends that came to mind, following no particular system. And try to get back into a good flow with stuff that really matters. But not worry too much about the details, since I had already made good progress on the stuff that really matters.<br><br>This afternoon, I decided to try Vegheadjones' Random RAF when I got into that "tired zone", and it worked great!  The resistance melted away, and I got a LOT of stuff cleared. Even though I was tired, I wanted to keep going and going. Randomizer methods always seem to trigger that.<br><br>This can be their downside, too, at least for me. There is such momentum to charge forward, I don't want to slow down too much if I come to a task that requires too much time or thought. <br><br>No-list for deeper work, and Random RAF for more fragmented work, was a great combination today. No-list got me focused on the stuff that really matters when I had the energy and attention to focus on it and get it a good flow.  And Random RAF helped me be more systematic and resistance-free when I was tired and get a high volume of work done.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, <br><br>this combination of having a no list system for the important and urgent tasks and the long list system for the many small tasks might really help me to keep working inside a system. It resembles the situations which often appear (when using a long list system) where I feel that I cannot follow the rules of the system anymore (because of project pressure, additional unplanned work, etc.) and start to just follow my intuition. Then I get the impression that I have broken the rules, thus it becomes difficult to go back to the system. <br><br>In your system this is not breaking the rules but following the rules: Switch to a no list system when priorities are obvious, switch to a long list system when you have to do a lot of small things and when you need the "guidance" of the long list - and don't feel like breaking rules. <br><br>Great! I'll give it a try.</div>

<div class="content">@vegheadjones: "...if the randomizer does't hit a priority item, I see them as I count down the lines on a page and do them when needed."<br><br>You can actually call that rule "Divert", i.e. divert from your randomizing/counting and do the urgent thing to be done. Therefore you have four D's, in keeping with the theme.<br><br>This seems really tempting, I'm going to try the system out.</div>

<div class="content">Wowi I agree with you. If I feel that I must go against the system rules, I start to lose faith in the system, and ultimately this leads to resisting the system.<br><br>But lately I've been approaching it differently. My "system" is just to use my best intuition and reason and whatever other capacities I can bring to bear to my current reality. The method I use at any given time is a tactical decision. Using no-list for thinking, deep work, "current initiative" work, etc., is a tactical decision. And switching to randomizer is a tactical decision. Deciding how to manage my calendar and meetings is a tactical decision. I'd prefer to develop these into useful habits so the decision what to do in any given situation is more-or-less automatic, but still reserve the freedom to override my habits with whatever my reason and intuition etc. guide me to do. I think this is what we all do anyway -- but sometimes we wish we could just turn it all over to a simple algorithm completely. I wonder why we do that.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, I think there are several reasons to do that.<br><br>One is clearly a morally upright one: better focus. You know it, if you have written down your stuff and put it over there, you can better concentrate on whatever we are doing over here.<br><br>Also, fear of doing the wrong thing.<br><br>Also, well, a lot of the things we have to do, wen don't really want to do. So we try to help ourselves over that by maintaining a system.<br><br>Also, geekdom, having all those cool gadgets and stationary, wann use them for something cool, Mr. Special Agent Topster, right?<br><br><br>What else?</div>

<div class="content">Great article on Decision Making - I'm going to be sharing this one! I don't remember running across it before! <br><br>(I just held the pencil for 1 second without dropping it, each time, so I didn't find the exercise very enlightening. I'll have to try it with a more consequential decision and see what happens!)<br><br>In my obtuse post you cited, I was trying to say something like this: Sometimes we try to elevate a tactical method (such as algorithmic time-management systems) into a complete framework for our lives. But this has ultimately proven to be disappointing, or at least unsustainable. It doesn't get us to the point of revealing our deep intuitions, which is where we find the way to the most impactful results in our lives, as you describe in your Making Decisions article.<br><br>The No-List methods have helped me with this more than any of your other methods. I always like to start my day with this. It gets me in touch with the stuff circulating below the surface in my mind, heart, and gut, and helps me get it out in the open and make it actionable.<br><br>The Random method is also helpful in a different way -- it eliminates the decision and just elicits an immediate response. I think this is also a way of prompting our intuitions to reveal themselves. The responses are usually something like these, and they are immediate:<br>- "This is wrong!" -> OK, stop and try to identify what's right<br>- "Delete!" -> This isn't needed, get rid of it<br>- "Defer!" -> I really can't do this right now - do it later<br>- "Do!" -> Just get it done, and quickly!<br><br>I think this is even faster and more accurate than the Standing Out method. Perhaps the fact that it relies on random selection is obfuscating what is really happening under the surface. It is really working with your intuition in a deep and immediate way.<br><br>I always try to start with the no-list approach and sustain it as long as I can. But when my day is too fractured or doesn't have enough discretionary time, or when I just start to feel tired and "wandering", I've been switching to the random method. Together, these give me a "fast, flexible, systematic" combination that keeps me focused on the things that matter, and help me keep up with all the maintenance and little details that need to be dealt with.<br><br>The TOC Thinking Processes are really helpful here, too, especially when my intuitions are pulling me in different conflicting directions. They help verbalize the intuitions and put it into a logical framework so I can see what's really going on. This isn't meant to rationalize the intuitions -- coming up with the "reasons" -- but rather to clarify the logical dependencies and conflicts to help figure out what the intuition is really saying, validate the logic of it more rigorously, and pre-emptively identify and avert undesirable side effects of decisions and actions. The Evaporating Cloud conflict diagram is especially easy and fast to use, and has an amazing ability to resolve those intractable vicious circles.</div>

<div class="content">By the way, I've been reading the book Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform our Lives<br><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Messy-Power-Disorder-Transform-Lives/dp/1594634793" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://smile.amazon.com/Messy-Power-Disorder-Transform-Lives/dp/1594634793</a><br><br>It makes many observations relevant to this discussion, how randomness can be very healthy for sparking new ideas and solutions. Similar to Taleb's observations how antifragile systems are made stronger by random stresses.  I think these are additional factors that make the random methods so strangely effective. <br><br>In fact, it makes me wonder, if perhaps "standing out" might be susceptible to "confirmation bias" and other self-reinforcing negative effects? That had never occurred to me before, but perhaps it can help explain how some list systems that use the "standing out" method were susceptible to processing large amounts of trivia while leaving high-resistance work to languish.</div>

<div class="content">One last thing Mark as I read your experiment again. You wrote:<br><br>Books which are Done or Deferred will be replaced in their original position. <br><br>When I do Random RAF, I adopt two principles from you that run counter to that: 1) From your Random method, if I do, defer or delete I cross it off and that become a slide. This puts pressure on the earlier items. It also puts tasks that I am still doing at the end of the list, in the case of the difficult books, it would reduce the probability of them being read again soon. 2) As you had said in your instructions for RAF, when an item is deferred it does not go on the end of the list but on the calendar for a future date. So if you landed on one of your 25 books and got a visceral "NO!" reaction, but you felt that you want to read it later, it should not stay on your current random list.</div>

He says that they make antifragile systems stronger. Random stresses on fragile systems will break them, not strengthen them.<br><br>In fact it's relatively easy to break the Random System - I've done it several times. You just add more and more difficult things to your list and one day resistance will hit you like a sledgehammer. The system is fragile.<br><br>Now what happens in that situation with Simple Scanning? Nothing. The system will survive quite happily because you don't have to do any of the really difficult things - least of all at a difficult time.

<div class="content">Interesting experiment with the books. Simple scanning got a lot accomplished. Randomizer weeded the list. Both very useful.<br><br>One thing is missing from the experiment: Pressure. It looks to me like the books on your list are for entertainment, learning languages you are interested in, and understanding the human condition. All things chosen by you. That's very different from things required by your family, today's job, or your future career. Would that difference of pressure would make a difference in resistance?<br><br>I use them both, usually starting with Simple Scanning. Simple Scanning doesn't work when I'm unable to settle down and work, or when whatever choice I make is wrong because something else feels more important (usually a sign of overwhelm). In those cases, Randomizer often breaks the block. I sometimes make it more powerful by taking a few minutes to prepare myself to accept the results (Buddhist Equanimity), or praying that God direct the dice.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket, <br><br><<One thing is missing from the experiment: Pressure...Simple Scanning doesn't work when I'm unable to settle down and work, or when whatever choice I make is wrong because something else feels more important (usually a sign of overwhelm).>><br><br>To be honest, it seems that in such instances you do have an inkling of the things you have to do but because of the pressure you are not clear on what exactly those things are.  In such instances Simple Scanning might not work because the voices in your head and heart clamor for your attention too loudly for you to notice the things that "stand out" in the list.  You then use Randomizer to at least get you going but you might be hit and miss on what you need to do, but hey at least you use DDD so you move on if it's a miss, right? <br><br>I think in such instances probably it's best to try out the Panic List, also called, as Seraphim wisely pointed out, AF2.<br><br><a href="../blog/Thoughts on the Long List - The Panic List.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/10/5/thoughts-on-the-long-list-the-panic-list.html</a><br><br>You do not need to use a different piece of paper or notebook from your other main list because you can go stalactite/stalagmite.<br><br>1) Abandon your main list for now.<br>2) Starting from the bottom of the last page of your main list, list three or four tasks that are currently giving you pressure.  What are the voices in your heart and mind clamoring for you to do?<br>3) Scan from the last item of this short list and do whatever stands out.<br>4) Keep on adding tasks that are pressuring you whenever you realize them.  If the main and short lists meet somewhere in the middle of the page, draw a line between them and go to the next page.<br>5) Once you finish an item start scanning again from the last item of your short list.  If needed and they are not that urgent anymore, add them to your main list.<br>6) Keep on doing it until you have done them all, then go back to your main list.<br><br>I have to attest that this works at least for me, because I got through a need for it just now, and it worked great.  I then remembered your post here and I just had to share it with you.<br><br>Now I am trying to think of clear, objective criteria for using PL/AF2.

<div class="content">Reading over Mark's book experiment, I had a different reaction.  It seemed to me the random method was effective, though in a different way than simple scanning.  Scanning got some books read, while random got some books removed from consideration.

You just add more and more difficult things to your list and one day resistance will hit you like a sledgehammer. The system is fragile >><br>I stopped using your original Randomizer method precisely for the same reason. The combination of Randomizer and RAF that VegHeadJones describes gives different results. I found when I combined it with No-List, it gave even better results (for me).<br><br>No-List always gets to the heart of whatever is on my mind -- whether conscious/rational or unconscious/intuitive -- and that has always had the same feel of "rightness" as "standing out" but taken to a deeper, more engaging level -- more visceral, more alive, more in-the-present. I think it uses the same positive mechanism as "standing out" -- recognizing the things that are important and valuable, even if I can't articulate WHY they are important and valuable. <br><br>One problem with No-List (for me at least) is that it can be mentally exhausting. When I'm tired, it's much harder to get going with it. Or sometimes I just don't get any traction with it -- it feels like I am having an "off day". <br><br>Those are the times I turn to Random RAF. It seems to engage the brain much differently. When it selects a task, I almost always just do it or delete it immediately. It isn't a deliberative or even meditative process at all. It's very fast. I can process 20-30+ tasks very quickly before I hit a task that gives me any kind of pause. Random RAF gives me an easy way to deal with it -- just defer it. It's probably giving me pause for a good reason. Once I realize I am pausing and deliberating, I just defer it and move on. This isn't so much a conscious decision as making an observation.<br><br>Actually that's true with almost all of this. With No-List, I am observing what comes to mind, what arises out of the depths, and writing it down where I can see it and intuit my way through it to decide where to focus. But even this "deciding" is really a matter of trying to find the thing that "stands out", that "feels right" -- again, it's a matter of observation, not so much rational decision-making. <br><br>The same is true with Random RAF (at least for me). I'm not *deciding* whether to "do, delete, or defer". Like I wrote above, if it's do or delete, it's just obvious, and it gets done. If it's defer, again, it's obvious (by the fact that I'm pausing over it), and once I realize that's what I'm doing, I defer.  <br><br>Also with Random RAF, I am doing things that I might otherwise not ever choose to do. Either because I just don't want to do it, or because it doesn't seem important, or whatever. But with Random RAF, most of the time, I just do it. Or it is now obvious it's not needed, so it's deleted. <br><br>I am trying to say that it selects different stuff than "standing out" does. It makes me look at things that would not stand out. This makes a lot of things get closure much faster, by either getting done or getting deleted.<br><br>These two approaches (No-List and Random RAF) work really well together for another reason. At the end of the day, I can look over all the stuff I've deferred -- it's easy, I just look at the last page or so of work. This gives my unconscious mind fodder to process overnight, so when I start No-List the next day, some of that stuff just comes up naturally and gets done. So later on, when I am in Random mode, I find a lot of that stuff that was deferred earlier, got deferred because it needed more deliberation and intuiting, and got handled appropriately during the No-List time.<br><br>Anyway, that's what is working for me at the moment. The key thing I am learning is how powerful it can be just to *observe*, rather than try to *decide*. I think Standing Out works on a similar principle, but it doesn't clear the dross as quickly, or process the boring stuff as quickly.<br><br><< You're trying to get past the problem of the Random Method's fragility by introducing a triple choice. >> <br>I've tried to make it clear that (for me at least), it's not so much a matter of conscious choice, or "making a decision". If I find myself thinking about it too long, that means it's a "defer". It's more a matter of the right thing to do appearing almost instantly in my mind.  The change is that I am explicitly allowing myself these three options. <br><br>Following a "standing out" method can also work the same way, for all practical purposes. As you scan, something might jump out at you as "ready to delete". So it gets deleted. (Right? I mean, this is what you do also, right?) And then you carry on looking for whatever stands out. Things that *don't* stand out are deferred. It's not conscious -- it is simply how the system works. The items that don't stand out just stay there on the list, deferred at least for the moment, till you cycle round to them again. The Random RAF method makes this all happen more quickly, at least for me.<br><br><< I suspect that you may have added to the system's fragility, but only time will tell. >><br>You might be right, of course!  But in practice I am finding it to work in exactly the opposite fashion. <br><br><< paralysis >> <br>There was lots of discussion on that. I don't seem to have a problem myself with this, neither with No-List, nor with Random-RAF.

As we scan along, we wait for that special feeling of "Aha! This is what I'm going to do next," no "wanting" involved.

<div class="content">I found a system that's even better than FAF to use with "do every task except the ones that stand out as ones we don’t want to do" (I am going to call this "reverse standing out" for now). And it really is a blast from the past: AF4.<br><br>AF4 lends well into such a system since the Closed List naturally fits with "reverse standing out", where you need to be thorough, while the Open List definitely needs "standing out" because of the need to be flexible in handling urgent stuff which typically are found in it.  It has a natural landmark to signal the change from "reverse standing out" to "standing out", which is the dividing line, and vice versa.  Also, because of the thoroughness of "reverse standing out", you can safely switch from the Closed List to the Active List upon reaching the dividing line without going back to the beginning, and because of its speed (and let me point right now that it is amazing to find a process that is both fast and thorough!) there is little danger of the old disadvantage of AF4 where we bog down when the Open List bloats in size.  Finally, dismissal now actually makes sense and is even a natural consequence of the system, since once you have a pass through the Closed List without doing any task, what obviously will be left in the Closed List are the things you do not want to do.<br><br>1. Once you have a list of things to do, close it with a line.  Everything above this line is the Closed List, while everything below it is the Open List.  You can write new tasks into the Open List anytime.<br>2. Start from the beginning of the Closed List.  Do the tasks in order except those that you do not want to do, then cross them out when you have done what you can for now.  If needed, rewrite them at the end of the Open List. <br>3. Once you reach the dividing line, switch to the Open List.  Starting from the beginning of the Open List, scan down and do the tasks there that "stand out" as things you want to do, then cross them out when you have done what you can for now.  As always, if needed, rewrite them at the end of the Open List. <br>4. Once you reach the end of the Open List, go back to steps 2-4<br>5. Once you go through the Closed List without acting on any one active task, dismiss everything above the dividing line by drawing diagonal lines across the pages of the Closed List, then drawing a new dividing line at the end of the Open List, making it the new Closed List.  Be sure to review the dismissed items once in a while, for example by adding "review dismissed" into your AF4.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster - <br><br><< [Random RAF is] not getting you any faster to the tasks that you do need to be doing now.

<div class="content">nuntym;<br><br>So it's basically identical to AF4, except that you do all the tasks in the closed list in order unless they stand out as not to be done. Is that right?</div>

<div class="content">Usually something like this:<br>1. Write down everything on my mind (on whiteboard or temporary scrap of paper)<br>2. Choose the top few things (by dotting them or something)<br>3. Erase everything else<br>4. If something resists being erased, move it to my Random RAF list.</div>

<div class="content">Bernie:<br><br>The words "want to do next" are my attempt to explain how to do it for people who can't grasp the concept. I don't use any question or description myself.<br><br>As I said in the above story of how I came across the idea of "standing out", I never had any difficulty grasping the author's meaning. It just seemed perfectly natural to me. So when I first introduced the concept in (I think) my description of AF1, I was surprised when quite a lot of people told me that they had difficulty grasping what I meant. <br><br>Since then I feel as if I'm trying to explain the unexplainable. To me, it's as if someone said "Could you please explain the thought processes you go through when you want to move your hand."</div>

I think your most effective description is the one about scanning for something that "feels ready to be done."<br><br><br>Christopher,<br><br>"It's right there in the part you quoted."<br><br>I hadn't noticed! But it's a different "want." Wanting to write "clean out garage" on your list is not the same as wanting to do it next.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym<br><br>The modified AF4 was initially very successful but did not survive until the end of the day. I made good progress through the morning on things that would not have stood out with "normal" scanning. By late afternoon I was anxious to move on to urgent tasks. Af4 is usually good at this type of urgency but I think I was resisting dismissal. <br><br>I wonder if anyone has tried limiting the size of the closed list in AF4 ? Rather than creating the closed list by drawing the line at the end of the open list instead drawing the line after a predetermined number of tasks. Say the oldest 10 or 20.</div>

<div class="content">Caibre65: "Af4 is usually good at this type of urgency but I think I was resisting dismissal."<br><br>Yeah I noticed it was the dismissal process that ruined the system.  I think that means we have to take dismissal out of the equation if we're doing a "Standing out for No" system.<br><br>"I wonder if anyone has tried limiting the size of the closed list in AF4 ?

<div class="content">It just occured to me that a more refined way of doing Randomizer might be changing the DDD's into "Do or Slide", that is, either do it or go down to a task you are OK to do.  Of course, that ruins the dismissal strategy of RAF, but it just might fix the flexibility problems.<br><br>Anyways just throwing out an idea.</div>
