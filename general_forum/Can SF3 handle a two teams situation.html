<div class="content">I'm using SF3 since 2 weeks after 2 years of mostly AF1. I'm now confronted with a situation that raises some questions in my mind.<br><br>I'm currently transitioning from one team to a new one. We have an arrangement where, during a 4 months transition period, I work in my old team on some days of the week and in my new team on the remaining days. (E.g. for March this means Mon, Tue & Thu in the old team and Wed & Fri in new team.) Sometimes there can be exceptions, when I spend some time on an urgent request from one team on a day of the other team. And then I have some activities that are not specific to any of the 2 teams.<br><br>This creates a problem in SF3, especially in Column 2 and with dismissal.<br><br>For Column 2, the rules require that we work on all items before we can turn to the next page. If C2 contains unfinished tasks from Team 1, and I'm on a Team 2 day, then I'm not supposed to work on them that day, and I can't move ahead.<br><br>Similarly, if Column 1 only contains Team 1 activities and I'm on a Team 2 day, this means I should dismiss the page, whereas on a different day I'd just start working on the tasks.<br><br>I thought about drawing a line in the middle of C1, having the both halves of the page reserved for one of the teams, and ignoring the part of the colums that is not relevant that day. But this still leaves the non-team specific tasks: where do I put them? Similarly, having 2 parts in C2 could work for unfinished tasks, but an urgency from the "wrong" team should still be handled by C2 anytime. Using alternating Team 1 and Team 2 pages is essentially similar.<br><br>What would be a good approach to handle this (temporary) situation?</div>

<div class="content">Mark mainly advocates a separate list for separate contexts (view that as a very large context like home and office). Maybe it would profit you to do that?</div>

<div class="content">Not quite, because of 2 things:<br>- some tasks are not team specific and can be done whenever I feel ready or have the opportunity to do them (so they should be on both lists)<br>- there are some limited instances where Team 1 tasks still need to be done on a Team 2 day (and could potentially overflow back into a Team 1 day if unfinished).<br><br>So there is some overlap between the lists. This is amplified by the fact that both teams are very close to each other, both physically and organisationally.</div>

<div class="content">Would it help if you would mark the tasks with T1, T2, and NT (Team 1, Team 2, and Non-Team)? And then ignore T1-tasks on T2-days and vice versa?</div>

<div class="content">Here's an idea, though it's a departure from the rules as written.  Leave the irrelevant items in column 2 as you turn the pages.  When you start a new day, move any now-relevant column2 items to the current page.  It's essentially the same as copying it from page to page as you go, except that it has less overhead.  You just defer pushing the column 2 items forward until the right day arrives.<br><br>I might also suggest getting one of those pens that has 4 different colors and using a different color for T1, T2, and NT. Except those pens aren't very nice to write with.</div>

<div class="content">Nice idea about the colour pen DonR.<br>In fact, there are pens of this type that received awards from the arthritis foundation or something. They are called Dr.Grip I think and that's what I use. They cost about what you'd expect for these pens and writing withbthem is pure bliss!</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>Thanks for the tip about the multicolor Dr.Grip pens.  I found one that has 4 inks plus a mechanical pencil:<br><br><a href="http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/product/view/products_id/2266" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/product/view/products_id/2266</a><br><br>Looks awesome.</div>

Sometimes I am at work and I can't do the personal items in Column 2.<br><br>Mark Forster recommends moving forward Column 2 items that can't physically be done -- so that's the rule I follow.<br><br>However, our situations are slightly different.  I usually have time for both work and personal tasks every day.   In your situation, you may go for a series of days without working on one of your teams.  So, you'd be forced to carry along those unactionable C2 tasks through many pages.  That seems impractical -- lots of rewriting -- and it would also cause C2 to fill up quickly.   <br><br>Maybe you could do this instead:   If you are working for Team 1, then copy your Team 2 items to a special page in the back of your notebook, and enter "Team 2 items" in C2.  Whenever you can't work on your Team 2 items, just copy that task forward to C2 on the next page..   When it comes time to switch from Team 1 to 2, copy your Team 2 tasks to your active C2 from the back of the book, and move your Team 1 C2 tasks to the back of the book.<br><br>It sounds like a lot of rewriting but I have found in practice that these kinds of things take a LOT less time to implement than it takes to describe them.</div>

<div class="content">I've started marking items with M and R for the two teams (first letter of the team name) and with X for cross-team. This facilitates my working through the lists.<br><br>It doesn't solve the fact that the dismissal process is essentially screwed up by this situation though... Maybe I should consider partial dismissal. If I don't work on any C1 items related to the day's team plus the cross-team ones, then I dismiss those, leaving in place the other team's items until they in turn get dismissed on one of their team's days. Not sure how this would work out.<br><br>I didn't get in a situation where I need to dismiss since I started using SF, but I feel the day is approaching fast when I will be...</div>

<div class="content">Marc, you might try something like this.<br><br>Have two lists, one for the days you're sitting with T1, and one for the days you're sitting with T2.<br><br>Don't worry about making the lists mutually exclusive--i.e., it's OK if the same task appears in both lists.  <br><br>At the beginning of a day when you're sitting with T1, do a scan of your complete T2 list and copy any tasks that you think you need to/want to do that day onto the T1 list.  That would include non-team specific tasks.  Then you can work the T1 list without worrying that you're missing something from the other list.<br><br>At the beginning of a day when you're sitting with T2, do the opposite.  Then you can focus on the T2 list until you switch contexts again.  If you encounter items while working the T2 list that were done on one of your T1 days, just cross them off.</div>

<div class="content">I have a similar situation between home and work. When I am in the home "zone" I need to be careful not to drift into scanning mail: when I'm at work I need to watch  that I don't walk the dog.etc etc.<br><br>I find the rules as written work perfectly well. Wen I come to a C2 that I can't do for any reason, including zoning, I usually demote it back to C1.<br><br>I do tag it with a flash of highlighter so that when I next come across it, I know to check whether it is then possible. If it is, I work on it to get it either done or back into C2 on the following page. <br><br>In general, I find that following the rules seems to work even when you think there might be a problem.</div>
