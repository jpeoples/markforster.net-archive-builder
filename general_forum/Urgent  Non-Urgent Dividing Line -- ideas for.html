<div class="content">The teaser for Linenberg's book "Manage Your Workday Now!" suggests a dividing line for "Now Tasks" and "Opportunity Tasks" of:<br><br>- "Would I stay late tonight to do it?"<br><br>That sounded like a good dividing question for Covey's Q1 and Q2, until I realized that most days there's nothing I'd work late to finish. By that rule, most of my work is Q2, and not getting done.<br><br>(Now I'm thinking that I should just leave them all in Q2 and use the dice. Maybe promote the ones with momentum to Q1, since, although I wouldn't work late for them, I want to take advantage of the momentum.)<br><br>So, do we have any other possible dividing lines, to help us focus?</div>

<div class="content">For me, the dividing line is pretty simple:  does it make me nervous to throw this on the list with everything else, where it might take Randomizer several days to select it?   If yes, I have to deal with it as an urgent task.   <br><br>Till yesterday, that would usually mean "do it now until interrupted by something even more pressing, and risk dropping it altogether", or perhaps "add a reminder so this task keeps jumping up in your face" which is essentially the same thing.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Another example:   I'd check my personal email at lunch.   For most of them, I could delete, read & archive, quickly reply, or add to my action list to be handled in the next few days.   But there'd almost always be 1-2 that needed a quicker response (same day or next day), but more time than I could give it at lunch, or perhaps I needed materials I only have at home, to deal with the task.   These tasks stick out like a sore thumb, and I wouldn't know what to do with them.   <br><br>So if they stick out like a sore thumb because of their urgency, maybe that's a good criterion too.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">My 3 questions would be:<br>1. Will my chance for successful result decrease considerably when not done today? (e.g. possible client sent me question yesterday. If I do not answer by today, I decrease probability that he would choose me...)<br>2. Will my resistance increase when not doing this task today/now? (Sometimes I know that I should do it today, because tomorrow it will be more difficult - I will have busy day tomorrow, or the key helpful person might not be there, or I feel that I am in the right mood to do it now - which is not very often....<br>3. Will not doing the task cause more psychological stress than doing it? (e.g. stressful task with lot of anxiety which I know I should deal with immediately. If not, I will think about it whole day and night otherwise...)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket <br>I think you're confused about Q1 and Linenberger's Must do today which he calls Critical Now. When you suggest to promote something to Q1, that doesn't make any sense.  Q1 is defined by both important and ACTUALLY urgent.  You don't want to create those.  Linenberger's opportunity now is triggered by start date which depends on several reviewing cycles.  It is not at all random.  I forgot what he calls it when you choose a few opportunity tasks that you want to focus on today.  In our parlance, they are non-urgent MITs.  You hope to keep work out of Critical Now or Q1 that were created by not getting them done in a more timely fashion.  Even those few from the main list are not Q1 status.  They are normal list items that you chose to give priority to today.  You're free to change your mind and work on other items on the list.  If possible, Q1 should only be other-directed work.  I really like Linenberger's system but I don't have enough tasks to warrant the work and the reviews.  If you don't do the reviews, his system is rendered ineffective.  His job responsibilities and ambitions demand it.  Mine doesn't. Both Covey and Linenberger's systems require frequent reviews, planning and prioritizing.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Daneb<br>I, too, prefer to actively weigh those considerations to help me choose the right work at the right time....or at least in that range.  Besides, I often don't have all that extra impetus to freely work a general list. If (when) I peter out, at least I mostly worked on pertinent work versus low impact work (in the current context).</div>

<div class="content">Interesting and useful replies!<br><br>Learning, Covey's Q1 and Linenberg's Critical Now are both for tasks that need to be done soon. Linenberg's Critical Now is for things that are actually urgent. He suggests "Would I stay late to do them" and "no more than five". Covey doesn't give a time criteria, but I remember them as "fires", and ideally you won't have many.<br><br>Q2 combines Opportunity Now and Over the Horizon, so you have to review the entire list often. Linenberger divides them. Opportunity Now are things you want to get to within 10 days, limited to 20. Over the Horizon are things that can wait longer, no limit. Review ON every day and OtH every week.<br><br>Covey doesn't sub-divide them, but emphasizes that Q2 isn't just about keeping ahead of the fires. The most important Q2 projects improve systems to avoid fires.<br><br>Target Now are the few Opportunity Now things you want to keep in sight more than the rest of them, and that's an advanced stage. (It's in chapter 6, at 17%, Kindle location 837, of Master Your Workday Now. It isn't in One-Minute To Do List.) They are a sub-set of the Opportunity Now. Covey doesn't make that division.<br><br>No system can handle a large number of tasks without regular reviews. The question is how easy is it to schedule the reviews by using the system. Do you have to review every project every week, or does the system easily let you spread them out.<br><br>Allen has the weekly brain dump, where he checks all projects, even those that won't need attention for months.<br><br>Covey has a weekly plan where you ensure you're taking action in each role and toward each goal. (If not taking action, it's by choice, not because you forgot.) I don't remember him spending much time on milestones.<br><br>Linenberg is the only one so far that encourages you to schedule reviews at a longer schedule. If you don't want to open the summer vacation file until March, then you schedule the review for March. If you want to weigh yourself monthly so you don't freak out over daily variation, you put it on your monthly review list. His paper system has one page per frequency. His ToodleDo system just has you categorize it as an Opportunity Now task, but with a start date in the future, with an appropriate repeat rate, then hide all tasks with future start dates. When the date arrives, it will appear in the Opportunity Now section.<br><br>Mark's systems all require regular reviews as well. In the short term, it's through scanning the list. In the long term, it's through reviewing dismissed items or ticklers.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket <br>Yeah, you pretty much have it correctly but you confused me when you said to graduate Q2 to Q1 like it's a good thing.  Since I'm always the rules questioner, I talked to Linenberger about these arbitrary numbers.  He stated that it's a general guideline for the masses.  If you have 18 Q1 phone calls, then it's silly to limit yourself to 5.  His layered review system is what I've been doing for decades so I was glad that I didn't have to ponder something new.  What especially attracted me to his system was that he uses start dates.  I like to start things early so that the deadline is mostly a guide to gauge a timeline.  I also like his idea of choosing 5 or so things that you want to seriously consider today.  No obligation.  Since everything is viewed according to start date, you are free to change your mind and choose from the other week to 2 weeks list.  Again, he used the arbitrary number of limiting view to 20 tasks at a time.  He stated that he choose that because that's the maximum that you can review quickly.  Again, it's a ballpark number.  Where we deviate is that I like a weekly aims list. That's easier for me.  He also promotes tagging if you like to work in projects or general categories.  When he explains the rationale for his system, it makes sense.  He didn't find my variations an insult to the principles of his system.  His whole system is based on the fact that deadlines create the most anxiety.  Not necessarily calendar deadlines.  It could be implied deadlines via your boss, social obligations, etc.  I never realized that until he explained it.  Expectations feel like deadlines.  He's a compassionate and intelligent guy.  I don't know much about Covey or David Allen.  I didn't relate to those systems.</div>

<div class="content">p.s. I like to plan and live my life via my values but I don't do it a la covey's roles. LOL!  David Allen's next action maga lists?  Not for me.  Many times, my task might be > or = 2hours project A.  I might not even know what I'm going to do yet so it would be silly for me to try to write down steps.  Usually I'll work on a project or category intiutively and maybe write a note of what's next or questions created.  Detailed lists overwhelm me. As I stated, many projects involve discovery, creativity and/or learning curve.  Allan's system was inimical to my natural thinking style.  Linenberger's system overlapped my existing system and Mark's DIT based on his overriding principles.  He also likes next actions but I don't adhere to that.  Some days My list might say Appointment X o'clock.  MIT project A > or = 4 hours.  The other stuff I usually just do by habit.  No need to write ingrained stuff.  But I understand his thinking for his situation.  He runs a company, writes and is a speaker.  He's like the POTUS in West Wing.  "What's next?" Many administrators have to think like that.  Between meetings, they can look at their list and it's in units that can fit time between meetings and calls.  Linenberger also emphasizes the importance of social connections and doing things that you enjoy or ignites your passion.  He sees you as an overall well functioning and happy human being.  He's a cool guy.</div>

<div class="content">Covey's roles are things like: wife, housekeeper, parent to R, parent to C, storyteller, education rep for guild. 3-7 is typical. In First Things First, his weekly form has you list a specific thing you'll do in each role. Often, but not always, a role flows directly from a value.<br><br>I've always done something similar to Allen's Next Action, but reading it really helped me refine it. The power isn't in writing down all the steps, but in knowing what the next step is. "Get car fixed" is harder to nail down and do than "call for car appt" or "call Joe for name of his mechanic." Allen was good to read and think about, and I like bits of his systems, but overall there's too much overhead.<br><br>Linenberg and Mark have some overlap, and some places where they start the same then diverge wildly. I'm reading L's chapter on visioning and then spinning the vision. It starts similar to Mark's Dreams, with listing emotional and vivid goals. Mark then has you review and refine daily, and they'll often evolve (money evolving to feel secure is the usual example). L only has one refining step. M has you contrast Future Self with Present Self daily. L has you picture yourself as Future Self several times a day. M sets up tension between FS and PS. L has you vividly imagine yourself as FS.<br><br>I don't have many ingrained routines. Too many other priorities!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Yup, that's Covey.  I don't tie my values to roles.  All of them are reflected as my character traits in every "role". I just don't relate to that at all. I try to do my best by anybody I interact with. I don't need separate roles to do right by people I care about.  Others do relate and did well by it.<br><br>I usually don't need next steps unless it's something I don't do often. I'll write them down for the rare times I need to repeat them.  My memory isn't great all the time.  Many problem solving and creative projects doesn't "have next steps".  It's many times a discovery process and just intuitively following what's in my head.  <br><br>I love my ingrained habits because it cuts down on thinking and deciding and covers most of the bases without thinking about it.  It saves lots and lots of time. I don't have to keep lists or write down stuff to keep up my home, my fitness, my food intake, errands, my pets, my overall work. (review and plan is a great habit.)  With most of that on autopilot, those things are naturally taken care of in the background.  I learned that in the days when I was always super busy.  It allows me extra headroom to focus on what I want, not having to decide when to do chores, ablutions, meals, etc.  The calendar is great for repeating stuff like change the heater filter, etc.  Even then, it feels habituated in a way because it gets done every month (every other month without pets).  I don't know how many times in my life I've heard people debate with themselves whether they are going to do simple stuff like start dinner, clean up, batch maintenance, etc.  My way, I don't have to think about it.  It's done in the background in almost imperceptible units throughout the day with very little thinking at all.  I'd rather use mental energy on things that actually need my brain.  Back then the house, auto, pets, etc had to be taken care of between 17hr shifts, rehearsing or training for tournaments, contests, etc. I didn't have time to think about those things. They were just done by rote.  Now it comes in handy because my brain registers when I HAVE NOT done it because not doing it feels unnatural.  It really helps not to have to actively think or decide that same stuff over and over. Plus, your list is a lot shorter without all of that background stuff. LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Pain spikes and brain damage sometimes screws some of it up. I have ticklers to back up the important stuff.  I'll notice if there any dishes in my sink but I may forget to mop the floors. Ticklers are a good backup just in case my brain fails me. Most of the time I do ok since I've been doing most of this for almost 60 years!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Covey didn't say your values have to be 1:1 to your roles, just that examining your values might affect your roles. Being a good person overall (value) affects how I parent (role). The fact that I try to parent well strongly suggests that I value my children and the future.<br><br>I used to do more routine tasks without thought than I do now. Supper making used to be routine! Oftentimes, now, though, I need a reminder. "That meat you thawed two days ago? I can put off marinating it for another hour while I ..."<br><br>Floor mopping. One of those things that grows quietly and can't be done entirely on schedule (unless my kids stop cooking). I look at it and think, "It's not that bad." The next day I think, "It's disgusting." One day of dirt shouldn't make that much difference!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>LOL about a day's difference on the state of the floors.  There's nothing sweeter than 3 German Shepherds running through the house after digging that black Jersey soil after  a rain or snowfall - NOT and the sand that comes with it.  LOL!  Better yet, add cats bringing into the house rodents and birds that they didn't bother completely killing.  LOL!  Blood and guts splashed on the walls while they furiously shake the thing and then the dogs fighting the cats for it.  LOL!  Life is much more peaceful right now and my floors are much cleaner.  Re: you kids cooking and leaving a mess.  Maybe penalize them by reducing their allowance $X each time.  LOL!  Unfortunately, they won't appreciate your efforts until they get their own place.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">I keep pulling them up the mountain, one step at a time. So far, being able to delegate supper, or her having a good time with her friend, are worth a bit more cleaning. If it's too bad, I make them clean it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>That's wonderful that she helps you with the meals. Knowing how to cook is an important life skill. Also, it relieves you.  Cooking is great fun but doing it a few times each and every day can get a bit old sometimes.</div>
