<div class="content">Mark, first a huge thank you for sharing AutoFocus with us!  <br><br>Also, a big thanks to all of you who have been sharing via this forum about your experiences.  I have been learning from you as well!<br><br>I am a Human Resources Manager, and as such, much of each day is spent fire-fighting.  I have made progress on minimizing (or I should say filtering) the interruptions.  However, in the end, a big part of my job is fighting the fires that must be extinguished the day that they are set.  This constant fire-fighting and internal resistance to my lists have led me to fail so many times with GTD and DIT.  <br><br>About my tweak:<br><br>I am a note-taker by nature.  It helps in my line of work to have documentation about conversations and decisions (just in case down the road we are dealing with a complaint or a lawsuit).  More often than not, whatever I am taking notes about becomes some kind of task for me. (For example, Call Peter to follow-up on theft incident that Paul reported).  I would highlight these actions in my diary and, if important, I would handle them during the day.  If I needed to carry them over to the next day, the actions were written into my AF List.<br><br>My tweak is now I take my notes directly into my AF List.  (Meaning I no longer have a diary and my AF List, I just have the one AF List).  So, now I might have an entry like this:<br><br>Paul - reported he was robbed, suspects proceeds sent to Peter >> Call Peter<br><br>(Let me just clarify that my notes are usually just a line or two in nature.  I would not recommend this tweak if you are taking copious meeting notes, for example.  I would keep those notes separate and then bring back specific tasks to your AF List.)<br><br>However, with this little tweak, I have a feeling that I am in control.  My AF List effectively captures everything that I need to be making progress on.  Plus, I am not flipping back and forth between notebooks.<br><br>Additionally, I find that AF has really helped me routinely process emails.  I am motivated to quickly delete, delegate, or do the little items.  I then add bigger tasks to AF.  With AF, I am motivated to apply "little & often" to these bigger tasks and actually get them done.<br><br>I wanted to also note that I use the tweak suggested by Matt C. about starting each line with a box and filling in the box when a task is completed (as opposed to striking through all of the content of the line).  I find it is much easier to identify on the page the two empty boxes for undone tasks instead of trying to find them amongst the lines that I struck through.  Also, since I am taking some notes into my AF List, I undoubtedly will need to be able to read what I wrote at some future date.  (Matt C., thanks for the very selective "dotting" tweak as well!)<br><br>Onwards and Upwards!<br>hat3</div>
