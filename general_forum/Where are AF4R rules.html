<div class="content">Hi David!<br><br>Glad to hear you are happy with AF4R.  I've been working away all these months with AF4, more or less happily, though finding that it's not too good with keeping me focused on the one or two most important things to do on a particular day.  <br><br>Will be reviewing the AF4R and SF3 avidly.<br><br>Alec</div>
