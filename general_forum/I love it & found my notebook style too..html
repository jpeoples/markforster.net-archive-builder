<div class="content">I have been working on this new system since the 5th, tried about three different list (work, home, personal) and where I should keep these lists.  I have worked with a franklin for over 20 years. So last night after work I went to my  local franklin store and I found the greatest list book-"Three Pads in One -Home, Work, Play" by a company www.knockknock.biz.  I have a conference  today and I am ready to go with my new list making, if fact, had time to send out this quick email.  Thanks,  I love this new list making system AutoFocus.  I call my day of planning once a month (Focus).</div>
