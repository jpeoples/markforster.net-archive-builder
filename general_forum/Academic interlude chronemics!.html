<div class="content">"Chronemics" turns out to be the name for cultural attitudes to time. The subject addresses:<br><br>(1) all time(s) are not the same<br>(2) all times are social constructions<br>(3) the times humanity creates direct the way humanity lives.<br><br>"The way an individual perceives time and the role time plays in their lives is a learned perspective."<br><br>A summary at:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronemics#Polychronic_Time" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronemics#Polychronic_Time</a><br><br>and explored nicely in this BBC documentary:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fz6pl5xo5M" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fz6pl5xo5M</a><br><br>Perhaps this awareness could help us to see that Western-time is one construction amony many and that our culture's conception of time-as-money permeates how we approach living.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Erin.<br><br>I also found Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" chapter 8 interesting. Everyone around Ivan wants time to carry on as normal (lots of references to clocks and appointments) as Ivan reappraises how he has used his own time...</div>
