<div class="content">just watched Midnight in Paris, the Woody Allen romantic comedy/fantasy. reminded me of future self talking to it's future self. or the movie Inception without endless shooting. i'm not saying more as to not spoil plot. just to say, is worth a watch & enjoyable as is really a thought piece on having discoveries and conversations with yourself.</div>

<div class="content">Disregarding his ethics vis-a-vis love/marriage, Woody produces a film a year. If Mr. Allen suggest talking to yourself, than talking to yourself it is!</div>

<div class="content">I suspect he uses the same techniques that are used by magazines, writers of daily blogs or columns, firms making regular product launches, etc.<br><br>These are (highly simplified) that one has a timetable in which an orderly sequence of products is at various stages of development. For a glossy monthly magazine for instance it might be that in August they have:<br><br>September edition going to press<br>October edition being written and designed<br>November edition being researched and planned<br><br>This technique can be highly effective if one is disciplined enough to keep to it. I used to use it for seminars and blog posts. These days it's too much like hard work, though I see with shame that Woody Allen is eight years older than I am so I have no excuse for letting up!</div>

<div class="content"><<I suspect he uses the same techniques>><br><br>My original post was more tongue in cheek. I believe Mr. Allen comes by his hard work honestly. By that I mean, many Ashkenaz Jews of my parents generation (the post-Holocaust generation) have an insatiable drive for success, the neurotic energy somewhat explained as a response to the horrors of the Holocaust. I don't feel like getting into the psychodynamics of it all... but this scene of Woody Allen with his parents -  from Wild Man Blues - should give a small idea of what I'm referring to: <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcXeBpz5Vgs&feature=related" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcXeBpz5Vgs&feature=related</a></div>

<div class="content"><< but this scene of Woody Allen with his parents - from Wild Man Blues - should give a small idea of what I'm referring to: >><br><br>Love the video, Avrum. Thanks for sharing it. From my perspective, what’s missing is the relationship….from what I can tell, Woody Allan wants his parents to see, him. Sure he mirrors them a bit but no mention of what their underlying reasons are for what they say and, he makes no effort to see, them. I think once their part is revealed in the relationship than what becomes obvious is that we’re really all very much alike. As you point out, they are living according to their values, however, neurotic it seems. <br><br>I know you’re probably not looking for a debate on this nor for agreement or disagreement. Just felt like I had to put in my two cents since I work with older adults and have learned a lot about seeing them as people (something I struggle with every day with my 89 y/o mother). Whenever I expect her to be my mother, I’m disappointed. When I have the grace of god to see her as a person, things don’t go so badly.</div>

<div class="content">Best line in the scene:<br><br>Woody's mother: "... but it's so hard to make a living in show business". <br><br>I've always wanted to create a blog highlighting the psycholgical profiles of our favorite productivity authors. I think that would (partially) explain:<br><br>1. What drove them to create these sysems<br>2.  why their systems work so well for them, and others.</div>

<div class="content"><<Best line in the scene:<br>Woody's mother: "... but it's so hard to make a living in show business".>> <br><br>Ditto - I loved that line!<br><br>And, yes, I am driven by the neurosis of the family I grew up in. What else is there!? :-) In fact, I'm working on using my own situation with siblings to create a product that will help other siblings dealing with eldercare.</div>

<div class="content">Well, yes....sort of loss interest after his "daughter" escapade. Still think he's full of talent contrary to what Mom and Dad say. All is well, Avrum, hope we can hook up on Skype one of these days...would love to share projects.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br>I like the sound of that blog! And include some more movies that illustrate "Dreams" and/or "Autofocus" principles? There are lots of America-dream-achievement movies of course but how many would illustrate Pull mode? Maybe the one about the baseball pitch: "build it and they will come"? Can anyone list others that might help us build that barn?</div>

<div class="content">Michael:<br><br><<There are lots of America-dream-achievement movies of course but how many would illustrate Pull mode?>><br><br>I don't think I've ever read an account of the "(wo)man behind the machine" type of stories. For example: S. Covey tells the same story about how he compiled the 7 Habits system. Which is fine. What I'm curious about is: What was S. Covey's childhood like? Poor... wealthy? What were the governing principles in his family? Secular or religious? Same for Tim Ferris, Barbara Sher, etc. <br><br>What I'd love to see is each system broken down by certain criteria, allowing an individual - with no prior knowledge of goal setting - to pick one that reflects their principles, goals, etc. <br><br>.</div>

<div class="content">although I love the responses, this is funny, I was not discussing how Woody Allen is able to make a movie every year. some of you seemed to pick up on this, others not. my fault, was being vague to not spoil plot for those that have not seen.<br><br>SPOILER<br><br>Midnight in Paris is about being obsessed that "things were better" - pick your favorite golden age, than they are now. in this film, the 1920's Paris. The protagonist goes back to the 1920's, science fiction? in his mind? does not really matter, this is all a story vehicle to explore this idea that things were better. from there, he finds characters who believe the golden age was 1890's.<br><br>and that is about it. a very simple sweet film. fun to watch, he meets all of the famous people you'd expect him to meet.<br><br>it was in the concept of thinking about being better in 1920's and from there thinking that 1890's is better and then finding that those in the 1890's wish they lived back in the Renaissance. so, mostly a thought experiment of self in past talking to self in that past. and of course from there, he realizes things about his current self/time.<br><br>preferred this to Inception. it also had mind puzzles, dream within dream within dream ... however, later I was left feeling all only an amusement ride, did not learn anything. with Midnight in Paris I did. oh, and less guns, as in none.</div>
