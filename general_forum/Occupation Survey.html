<div class="content">Having enjoyed the personality type thread, I believe it might be interesting to survey what profession, occupation, trade, calling, métier, users of the AF system are involved in. I'll start.<br>Television Writer/Producer-currently in writing phase. Using AF for work and personal.</div>

<div class="content">I'm an account planner in an advertising agency. (Our department researches, creates, implements and reviews the strategy for a product or brand, we don't actually write the ads).<br><br>I tend not to procrastinate so much at work as I have a supportive team, although there are lots of lastminute panics about presentations. <br><br>But my home life is utter chaos, and my postgraduate degree is a decade behind its original deadline.<br><br>I am using AF in line with some of Mark's other techniques from GED and MYDCT - I found DIT great in theory, but found it hard to implement as it makes too many demands of really hardened procrastinators like myself. My favourite tips of his are the timer technique, 'I'll just get the file out" and halving, all of which work brilliantly with the 'little and often' of AF.<br><br>The biggest revelation of AF for me has been the fact that you get to cross off things you haven't actually 'done' yet - it's totally okay to have just started on a task. For a person who has previously managed to get almost nothing crossed off her 'to do' list before, it's a wonderful feeling.<br><br>I have made a few amendments to AF. I started using the post-it note mini-lists (to buy; to do in town; urgent today) almost immediately, even before it was suggested on this forum. I also use black pen to write the tasks, and cross them out when completed in black pen. If they're still a work in progress, I cross them out in red pen, and note how long I spent on a particular task on that occasion in the margin. If I beat a previous best ever, I reward myself with a treat - a coffee or a magazine. I find this acts as a great motivator as there are still some tasks on my list I'm resisting.<br><br>I haven't yet dismissed any tasks, and I tend not to write down anything I do automatically, such as empty the dishwasher or load the washing machine.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, in my very long (and off-topic!) post, I didn't say that the mini-lists are culled from the AF list - they aren't totally separate lists. <br><br>This is an important point as you have to let the 'air' of AF get to everything on your 'to do' list before you action any of it. <br><br>Eg I have "buy new wardrobe for spare bedroom" on the AF list, but it doesn't appear on the shopping mini-list as my brain has already acknowledged it isn't as important as milk, eggs and printer paper. <br><br>Previous to AF I would have spent hours of my day searching online for the perfect spare-room wardrobe as this would have been so much more fun than heading to Sainsbury's...</div>

<div class="content">Part-time Vicar.  And Mum.  Struggling still to get AF to work for me.  Mainly because I hardly ever to seem to have much 'processing' time either at home or at work.  And I don't get round to looking at the lists!  I'm a chronic procrastinator and 'butterfly mind' ENFP on Myers Briggs.  But I've enjoyed incorporating bits of Mark's wisdom over the years since I first read 'Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play'.</div>

<div class="content">Philosophy professor. No teaching or admin work at my institution in January – just research (my favourite) – so I've yet to try out Autofocus in the full swing of the semester. But it's working extremely well for me so far, and I've often struggled with periods – summers, January in my current job, research leaves – which have little or no externally imposed structure (that is, research-only periods – despite the fact that research is what I care about the most), and Autofocus has definitely been an enormous help with that. <br><br>I'm also using Autofocus for the rest of life, too, and I suspect I'm feeling less stressed than I would be otherwise about the fact that my wife and I are expecting our first child in May. (No stress might be a bit of a tall order for that one....)</div>
