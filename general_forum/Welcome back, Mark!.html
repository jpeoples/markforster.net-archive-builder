<div class="content">Thanks, Bernie.<br><br>No, I found English was more understood than French in the Holy Land.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>It depends what you mean by a holy site - just about everywhere there has some sacred history. Beersheba, Masada, Qumran, Jericho, Lake Tiberias, Capernaum, Mount of the Transfiguration, Mount of the Beatitudes, Source of the Jordan, Vale of Jezreel, Nazareth, Caesarea Philippi, Bethlehem. And at Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, Holy Sepulchre, Dominus Flevit, Gethsemane, Bethphage, Wailing Wall, Temple Mount, St Peter in Gallicantu. <br><br>I think I've probably forgotten a few!<br><br>By the way, there were a lot of Russian Orthodox pilgrims. One nun sung the most beautiful solo in the Church of All Nations on Gethsemane. I recognised it as an Orthodox hymn that I'd heard before, but I haven't been able to find it since my return. What would you consider to be an appropriate hymn?</div>

<div class="content">Mark - I'd guess it would be one of the hymns from Holy Thursday.  My daughter thought it might simply be Tsaritsa Moya Preblagaya, a very popular hymn to the Theotokos that is often sung in Russia or Ukraine -- not really connected to Gethsemene but is just a popular hymn.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>It's not Tsaritsa Moya Preblagaya.<br><br>My guess was the same as yours - that it was one of the Holy Thursday hymns. But I can't find the right one. I expect I'll hear it again some day and recognise it.<br><br>(Later) I found a Youtube version of exactly the same hymn being sung at Gethsemane two years ago. I don't know if it was the same nun, but her costume and voice are identical:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tgHp__nN04" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tgHp__nN04</a><br><br>Maybe you can tell me what the hymn is?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I'm not 100% sure of the beginning of the hymn.  The last half, however,  is <br><br>Покланяемся Страстем Твоим, Христе: покланяемся Страстем Твоим, Христе: покланяемся Страстем Твоим, Христе, покажи нам и славное Твое Воскресение.<br><br>The translation for this is<br><br>We worship Thy Passion, O Christ.  We worship Thy Passion, O Christ.  We worship Thy Passion, O Christ.  Show us also Thy Holy Resurrection!<br><br>This is normally sung on Great Friday Matins (15th Antiphon). <br><br> It may also be sung elsewhere as part of other prayers However,  I cannot make out the words from the first minute or so..</div>

<div class="content">Brilliant, Paul. That's it!<br><br>The title of the hymn is Днесь висит на древе<br><br>What an amazing resource this forum is.<br><br>There's an English language version at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKdgbTXqjUk&feature=related" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKdgbTXqjUk&feature=related</a><br><br>Today He who hung the earth upon the waters is hung on the tree, <br>The King of the angels is decked with a crown of thorns. <br>He who wraps the heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery. <br>He who freed Adam in the Jordan is slapped on the face. <br>The Bridegroom of the Church is affixed to the Cross with nails. <br>The Son of the virgin is pierced by a spear. <br>We worship Thy passion, O Christ. <br>We worship Thy passion, O Christ. <br>We worship Thy passion, O Christ. <br>Show us also Thy glorious resurrection</div>
