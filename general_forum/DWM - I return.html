<div class="content">I humble return to DWM (implemented with The Hit List, using Freedom (to block www use for a specified time), & a pomodoro timer) knowing that I may jump at the next new thing. For now, it's good to be back.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome back, Avrum.  Just out of interest, what system were you using before, and why did you decide to change back to DWM?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum . . . I think I know how you feel . . . I have just come back to AF1, using Andreas's excellent online app . . . right now, I can't imagine why I ever switched to anything else, but I can't deny that this cycle may yet repeat itself again . . . human nature is weak!<br><br>acedia xx</div>

<div class="content">Hi ds. <br><br>Oh, it's very simple. I keep everything in the inbox, and add a due date according to the rules (actually I use 7d - for 7 days - and 1m - 1month). In the view menu, choose "sort by" and "due date". Beautiful. I have four tabs open:<br><br>today<br>inbox<br>complete<br>waiting</div>
