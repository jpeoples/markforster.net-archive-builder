<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>this is kind of a counter topic for "AF4 in Brief". Because you won't find "brief" here. I went a little crazy last night (happens alarmingly often lately) and create the most elaborate documentation of Mark's AF4 demonstration ever (524 pages, 3,4 mb). It shows every single step. And I mean really, really low level. It basically shows how Mark's eyes moved during using the list - or at least should move according to the rules. ;-)<br><br>I'm not sure if it's gonna be of use for anyone, but you can take a look at it: <a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/af4-demo.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/af4-demo.pdf</a><br><br>Perhaps some people will understand the rules better if they are spelled out so graphically. Perhaps I just wasted some time, but I feel good about it. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Just noticed I dropped the task "Name of Firefox Extension" early on. Since I don't want to edit 520+ pages and it never got actioned anyway, I'm currently uploading a version that leaves it out completely. Looking at the sheer size of that document, there will probably be some more errors.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>You are a bona fide nut ;-)  Actually, stepping though that document made it so very clear.  It was like having the demo in 2 minutes!  For someone who did not attend the live demo, this has got to be the best explanation of the system yet.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-6 10:25</div>
<div class="content">Wow! Andreas, you are indeed a total fruitcake!!!! :-)<br><br>I very much agree with Mike!<br><br>For some reason I had the idea that is was only possible to jump up and down twice between the two lists but I now see this can be done many times as long as you action at least one item of closed list in the first pass.<br><br>Thanks for this super efficient demo. The system really makes a lot more sense to me now and I think I will also give this one a go and I'm actually looking forward to it now (before your demo I was quite skeptic about AF4, thinking I would be dismissing like crazy).<br><br>Coooool!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark could do worse than host this thing.  It makes the system SO clear.  Despite all of the ways we have described the system in words, nothing touches this for clarity.  AND, it MUST be correct as it is an exact recording of what went on.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Thank you very much for this! The key to reading the PDF is to display on screen so that one complete page is visible. Then press the "next page" keyboard shortcut (right arrow in Preview for OS X) and keep an eye on the -> arrow :)<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Rob...</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-09-6 11:01</div>
<div class="content">Rob:<br><br>Yes, one page at a time is the key. Most PDF readers offer a fullscreen mode which does that automatically.<br><br>I find it most comfortable to to use the mouse wheel or just hold the "down" key. At least in Adobe reader, I don't know about other programs. I usually use PDF X-Change Viewer, but it flickers in fullscreen mode, Adobe is way better.</div>

I read the rules and thought I understood them, but, it turns out, I had the same misunderstanding that Cruisader mentioned, above, and was equally skeptical.<br><br>Your demo is, by far, clearer than any flow chart or set of rules. Kudos to you!</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>You are an inspired and busy man....many thanks for this, it works brilliantly. As others have said it is excellent to see how the list changes and grows over time, and the level at which Mark is working.<br><br>When you have 5 minutes...I'd certainly love to understand how you created it. I'd imagine that you used the firefox extensions to show all the changes, and then laid out one page in ?Word?, and copied on each time? It's the type of thing that it's always interesting to see how someone does (in less time than it would tkae me).<br><br>Jonathan</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-09-6 16:20</div>
<div class="content">Jonathan,<br><br>I used SiteDelta in the beginning, but realized that it was not good enough, because it only really saved a backup copy when you manually viewed the changes. So I wrote a small script that saved the backups for me. The creation process was pretty much like you described it. I used OpenOffice Writer instead of Word, but a lot of copying&pasting was involved. Its really great when you realize you made a mistake 20 pages ago and you must change them all. ^^</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this. Very clear. And for the 1st time, I can see that AF (all versions) is really a TIME MANAGEMENT system, not just a good to-do list.

That was certainly very instructive for me. Not just regarding AF4, but also on how Mark works his AF list with repeated tasks.<br><br>Analysing his "Email" task that was in column 3 at the start of the day, just after where he left off the day before - p 5 of 526<br><br>I see Mark passes "Email" multiple times as he cycles through the Active List and Backlog; sometimes doing (D), doing & immediately readding (DR), skipping (S) or just adding (A) - pp 16(DR), 36(S), 170(D), 196(A "Check Site Visitors"), 224(D), 306(A "Wash Up"), 501(DR), 522(D) ... ("Email" was readded before end of the day)<br><br>I can imagine Mark doing & immediately readding if he didn't manage to clear his inbox to zero. And when he managed to get his inbox to zero he didn't immediately readd the "Email" task.<br><br>However, I'm wondering what criteria/stimulus makes him add "Email" tasks, when he don't have it on his list. Is it time? After more than 1 hours perhaps? Or is it just intuition?</div>

<div class="content">Andreas, I had some questions from Mark's description, and this answered them all, AND excited me to try it out. I could FEEL how it worked from the demo (which only took a couple of minutes to go through.  I think this should be included with the instructions Mark, for visual learners like most of us.<br>Oh, and I wouldn't play up the 500+ pages element - that almost made me not open it...although I was curious.  It's so intuitive to work through the PDF.<br>One more thing: my day with AF4 today was the closest I've been to 'flow' for a very long time.  I think AF4 captures the strengths of AF1, while allowing you to get to the end quickly when you need to (before thrusting you into the 'harder' bits again).<br>Andreas, thank you.<br>Mark, you're brilliant.<br></div>

<div class="content">What a great PDF! What I didn't get was : was page 316 blank for some reason? And why are all items even if not re-entered counted as actioned?  It seems to me that some items don't get re-entered, not because you don't want to do them but because you realise you cannot do them in the near future. Surely you would want to possible review them later - kind of SDMB?<br><br>If you would normally take days going through the lists. The closed list could be weeks old if you are only picking off the odd thing? And the active list in this time could be growing (I find about 1/2 of my AF items get done on the first pass and others get picked off over time). But your working the open list from the oldest item. So today I added:<br>laundry<br>empty bins <br>clean bedroom<br>clean bathroom<br>check car oil (this one is urgent)<br><br>But these items will be done last on the list, or am I misunderstanding? Its hard to skip to them as they are so close at the end that I would then have done a pass and then be forced to go back to the close list.<br><br>Is my closed list weird? My closed list is either big jobs or items I am dragging my heels on. I know I _should_ do them, I kind of need to do them. But who has a task list only of items they want to do. Life is not that way. When I read the PDF it made me not want to use my current list on it. But I thought the idea was to allow backlogs in there?</div>

You can do one task from the backlog then go through the open list until you reach these tasks, then do all or some of them. Using the "little and often approach", this whole process could be done in a few minutes.</div>

<div class="content">I lost count, but by flipping thorugh the PDF you can see that Mark cycled through his lists many time in that one day.  I'd guess that he was through both lists (i.e. the open list) within an hour or not much more.  With the basic "common sense rule" you could certainly do items out of order if they were urgent.</div>

The reason they are deleted with a highlighter rather than the normal pen-stroke is so that on the next pass you can decide what to do with the deleted tasks (discard, re-enter, etc.)<br></div>

<div class="content">Mark--thanks for this. So on paper, when a task is up for review, and you indicate such with yellow high-lighting yellow, what do you do with it if you do go ahead and complete it? Green over the yellow?? <br><br>Don't mean to get too crazy-detailed here, but I am a paper-person and well, perhaps others are a little stuck here as well :~D<br><br></div>

I use Post-It (plastic "tape flags") on the first and last pages of my list.<br>2. I put a dot (.) on the left margin of the item I am currently working on. <br>3. I put an "x" on the left margin of an item that I decide I no longer want to do (call this "cancelled).<br>4. I put a vertical line on the left margin of an item that I have completed.<br>5. I put a horizontal line (-) on the left margin of the backlog items marked for dismissal. On the next (and final) pass through the backlog, I bisect that horizontal line with a vertical line (and, possibly, re-add the item at the bottom of the list).<br><br>A completed page will have a continuous vertical line down the left hand margin, with the exception of the x's in front of the canceled items.<br><br>I have had a lot of discretionary time during these first two days of AF4.

<div class="content">Reminder: When you post a link, remove the s from https and the link will then click through.<br><br>I will correct links when I see them, but that may not be for some time after posting.</div>

<div class="content">They should fix that.  Some sites you only want to access with a secure link.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Does Squarespace 5 allow custom JavaScript? If yes, I could write you some to recognize https links in comments and forum posts, if you'd like.</div>

<div class="content">Everyone:<br><br>In addition to Kjell's OneDrive share, I re-hosted the PDF here: <a href="http://andreasmaurer.net/public/data/af4-demo.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://andreasmaurer.net/public/data/af4-demo.pdf</a><br><br>Unfortunately, autofocus.cc expired a few years ago and is currently in the hands of Chinese domain grabber, as far as I can tell from whois data. I'd recommend replacing the link in the original post of this thread, since it's unclear how safe it is to visit the site.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>Thanks for the offer. But there are a very limited number of things that can be done with Comments and Forum Posts. There is no way that I am aware of of using custom Javascript or anything else in the Comments.<br><br>I might raise it with Squarespace, but basically they are not interested in updating Squarespace 5 any longer.<br><br>(There's no problem with blog posts. Https links work fine with them.)<br><br><<  I'd recommend replacing the link in the original post of this thread, since it's unclear how safe it is to visit the site.>><br><br>Sorry, I'm not clear where the link you are referring to is to be found.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><< There is no way that I am aware of of using custom Javascript or anything else in the Comments. >><br><br>Oh, it wouldn't be specifically for the comments, it would be a general option to add custom javascript, probably to the site header. To make sure it works on the comments would be the job of the script.<br><br><< Sorry, I'm not clear where the link you are referring to is to be found. >><br><br>I'm referring to the link in the first post of this forum thread, which is almost 9 years old - namely <a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/af4-demo.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/af4-demo.pdf</a> - that has stopped working a few years ago, which now caused this thread to rise back to the top. My suggestion that you edit this post and replace the link with Kjell's or my own, or - probably the best long term solution - host the file yourself. The same link is also used in the AF4 instructions blog post, equally broken there.</div>
