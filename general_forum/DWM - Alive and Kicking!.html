<div class="content">Created a new thread for DWM users. <br><br>I'm approaching the 2 month mark of using DWM with Omnifocus. <br><br>Anyone else doing the day/week/month shuffle?</div>

<div class="content">I've had a year where I've read all three of Mark's books and  tried several of Mark's systems. Though I really liked both AF2 and Superfocus I've gone back to DWM2. All Mark's systems have something to offer but I'm at my most relaxed and productive when using DWM2.</div>

<div class="content">Hi there, <br><br>I actually posted, but it didn't pop up...<br><br>In summary - I use Omnifocus and [pick your time management method].  Basically, I just haven't been able to stick consistently to a system. DIT was probably the one I stuck to most. I would be intrigued as to your setup Avrum with Omnifocus and DWM.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Simon</div>

<div class="content">Simon - <br><br>The video is coming! However I'm waiting for Omnifocus 2.0 to drop (probably early Feb 2013). In the meantime, I've survived a few 30 day periods by taking Dismissal & Little and Often very seriously.</div>

<div class="content">With the arrival of our newborn, DWM (and all productivity) took a nose dive. I'm back to implementing DWM with Omnifocus (and using a paper journal for sketching, project updates and journaling).</div>

<div class="content">Oh no, I have a baby on its way in 3 weeks. Clearly my productivity systems are going to go into a tailspin!</div>

<div class="content">Simon - <br><br>Bit of advice: The more established your rituals, habits, tools and systems pre-baby, the more able you'll bounce back as things return to your (new) normal. <br><br>For the first few days, I had running lists on the back of envelope. Worked like a charm. <br><br>Good luck!</div>
