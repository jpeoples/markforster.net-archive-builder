<div class="content">I just purchased a notebook to start working on AF1. I currently have been using a combination of GTD adn DIT, but I like the fact that AF1 has elements of the closed list effect (one thing I loved about DIT when I did it) but also seems to have very little system overhead involved. <br><br>One thing that I had missed up until this point is the suggestion to have separate notebooks for Home and Office. I like this concept because it keeps you FOCUSED where you need to be, but I am struggling to understand the implementation. <br><br>Does AF1 suggest carrying both notebooks with you at all times? For example, would I bring my HOME notebook to work with me and collect any HOME related thoughts in that notebook in that context? <br><br>How have people been working with the 2 notebook concept?<br><br>Any thoughts would be great.</div>

<div class="content">AF1 doesn't Require 2 books but many people do work that way, myself included.  I recommend a small capture tool for when you aren't with the right book. In my case I have a business card holder and write notes on cards. A PDA also works<br><br>or you can carry your books with you. You could even merge the two into one, say front for work and back for home.</div>

<div class="content">In any of the AF versions and with DWM, I have maintained 2 notebooks.  I do essentially what Alan does.  I have a small pocket notepad that I _always_ carry with me to write down stuff.  When I get to work, I open my list and transfer anything from my notepad that applies to work.  Likewise, when I get home I open my notepad and list and transfer anything that applies to my home list.</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>In a previous manual/paper version, I used the back of the notebook, but you can even try using the back upside-down for home stuff so that both work and home look "normal".<br><br>However in my new manual DWM approach, I am trying the following in an A5 notebook:<br><br>For work I write down the tasks on the right-hand page only.<br>For home/other, I use the back of that same sheet, ie a left-hand page, starting at the bottom of that page.<br>This keeps the two contexts (I have several more!) separate, so when I want to scan work items, I just look at the right-hand pages; for home the left-hand pages.<br><br>Before someone asks why i don't write home stuff opposite the right-hand page for that date, it's because I rip out the first sheet when that date has gone by and everything on it left undone is dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">Erik, I tried maintaining two running books for a while before I abandoned AF.  While it does keep you FOCUSED, it also had a haphazard effect for me in that I would be at home and remember a few things that needed to go to the work list and vice versa.  I found that to be annoying.  I do always carry around a post-it for such events, but then I ended up transcribing the tasks for each notebook, etc.  So I think if you're working in AF and you have a lot of free flow between your home and work space, or just don't like being annoyed in having to remember specific tasks to add to different workstations, a one-list system is optimal.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you everyone for sharing your thoughts on this. I think that I will take a test drive with the two notebook approach. So far I can see the great focus that the separation can provide. I realize that everyone's mileage may vary due to how blended one keeps their personal/work lives. Currently for personal stuff I will be using a small 5x7 inch notebook that I like because of its portable size. My work notebook will consist of a binder that I found in the supply closet and some loose leaf paper.  So, in all, a very inexpensive experiment with the 2 notebooks. I liked the suggestions involving a hack that keeps both lives in one book, but given my set of circumstances, it might be liberating to leave the work book at WORK!  :)<br><br>Thanks again.<br>Erik</div>

<div class="content">I forgot to mention, I do have a 3x5 card in my wallet for capture, so that will help if there is any cross-over thoughts that need to get captured.</div>

<div class="content">Erik:<br><br>"One thing that I had missed up until this point is the suggestion to have separate notebooks for Home and Office.

In fact, I would say that AF ain't so much as focusing me, but bringing the world into focus around me and highlighting where I can be most useful in it.<br><br>Some people find two separate notebooks useful, others not.<br><br>To think that your situation is similar to others' is a leap of faith.<br><br>The simple solution is to try both. Give each an honest try (few months). Some of the tips and pointers above might help you decide which might be best to start with or maintain, but ultimately experience will bear this out for you.<br><br>My suggestion overall is to give whatever choice you choose some time. Try AF as it is, before bending it to focus on what you think needs focusing on. That already exists; it is called a to-do list.<br><br>I use one notebook FWIW. And I do take back and forth from work. And I use a "satellite" notebook (folded up piece of paper) when carrying the larger notebook doesn't make sense.<br><br>This is what I have come to with experience.</div>

<div class="content">I am not doing AF, but I use a steno book for work and one for home.  It works great.  I have both of them near me at all times, as I am also always thinking of things that need to be on one of the lists.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">When I was doing AF, I used the "stalactite / stalagmite" method:   write work tasks from the bottom of the page going down, and write home tasks from the bottom of the page going up, and draw a horizontal line across the page where they meet.<br><br>This way, the two areas are separated so you can focus, but you only need one notebook and can still see both areas any time you need.</div>

<div class="content">Oops, sorry, it should have read:<br><br>write work tasks from the TOP of the page going down, and write home tasks from the bottom of the page going up, and draw a horizontal line across the page where they meet</div>

<div class="content">The other simple hack is to use a notebook one direction for work and flip it over and go the other direction for home or personal.  This works for lists.  Obviously if you are also using the notebook for notes you would want to rip out, you need to make sure there is nothing on the back of a page.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>
