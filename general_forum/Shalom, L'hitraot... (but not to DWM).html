<div class="content">Perhaps every "system" has a law of diminishing returns. Lately, there is a tone of nastiness that is impacting my ability to grow/learn from this forum. At times, I find myself getting caught up in the mudslinging. Clearly it's time to leave. <br><br>Perhaps this is all and good. I have a modified DWM, and it seems to keep me on track. What else can I hope for from a productivity system? <br><br>I will continue to peruse the back articles, and check back to see if a new system emerges (they always do). <br><br>Thanks to all the good people who've helped clarify Mark's system(s) to me. You made the transition from GTD to AF/DIT/DWM a smooth one, and without too much cognitive dissonance.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry to see you go, avrum.<br><br>As you say, the key thing is to get the system working for yourself. I hope you'll visit from time to time. This is, after all, more of a conversation between friends than a support database.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>You're being selfish ;-))))) by depriving the rest of us of your views which many of us have enjoyed!<br><br>Will is right, once you get it working for yourself, maybe you need the forum less, rather than not at all.<br><br>Go and keep well,<br><br>RogerJ</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Not for you to apologise, the rest of the gang got too het up.<br><br>How about a 24 hour stand-off/cool-down, no new posts or replies till 18h00 GMT tomorrow?  <br><br>No!  Because if we can't deal with this sort of issue, there's not much hope for the UN et all.<br><br>A luta continua, the struggle continues.<br><br>R</div>

<div class="content">Huh? What happened? Mudslinging? Maybe I was not paying attention...<br><br>I hate to see you go Avrum, as during my lurking months (which actually has not finished yet ^____^) your ideas and comments were very helpful.<br><br>I hope that changes in the near future.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym<br><br>"Huh? What happened? Mudslinging? Maybe I was not paying attention..."<br><br>You probably were paying attention, but had a reasonable reaction. The use of "mudslinging" here would fall under the definition of "hyperbole".</div>

<div class="content">Group Norm,<br><br>I'm inclined to agree with you, and with Avrum, but please don't tag me as a fence-sitter, forums need a bit of give-and-take.<br><br>Keep posting, both of you, preferably on topic, well, for most of the time.<br><br>RogerJ</div>
