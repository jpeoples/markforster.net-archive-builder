<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">We all want to make sure that the new SFv3 lives up to its promise, so let's all give Mark some additional ideas for stress-testing the system before its release.<br><br>For example, some of us (i.e., myself) have an issue with being attracted to every new idea that comes along (cleverly disguised as an overwhelming number of tasks).  Therefore, I would suggest that Mark use a Random Task Generator (such as a spouse, child, in-law, former colleague, local non-profit organization, etc.) to add 10 to 50 additional semi-relevant tasks to his list every day.   Will the Focus still be Super with the additional task load?   Will the system continue to produce the Results That Matter?<br><br>Another idea:  Work ahead on your Tickler file.  Mark uses Outlook reminders for this -- so just look ahead in your Task list for reminders scheduled to appear in the next week or two, and enter them a bit early into your List.     See how it handles the temporal dissonance.<br><br>Another idea:  Periodically "lose" your list by running it through the laundry; locking it up in a safe-deposit box for a day or two; pulling out a few pages at random to start a campfire; giving it to small child for half an hour, together with some markers or crayons; etc.<br><br>Another idea:  Go on an unexpected trip for 2-3 days and leave your List at home.  Or simulate a knock-down illness by entering items in your list with your off-hand (e.g., left hand for right-handers) using a dull pencil.  <br><br><br>Any other ideas?</div>

<div class="content">Wow, that really would make Mark's life difficult Seraphim!  Sounds cruel ;-)<br><br>I admit though there is the concern that his context doesn't correlate with others. Myself I wonder how it deals with 15 random interruptions during the day.</div>

<div class="content">I really don't see the point of this. <br><br>Mark will test - and use his every day activties in order to do that, then he shares his ideas with us all free of charge, then it is up to us to see if it works for us.  From previous posts we know that different systems work for different people/circumstances. I think it is our responsibilty to see if this new system will work for us - not his.</div>

<div class="content">This is really good, Seraphim!  Alan, I am anxious to see how the system holds up in my world too.  Multiple projects, all important, many tasks, graduate students, Post-Docs, multiple levels of commitment through my college to the university to nationally.  And then there are my service commitments to my community, etc.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">So do I <br>Just let me test it for a week with about a 40 calls per day, 50 emails, 10 to 20 things to follow, <br>30 projects and 3 new business opportunities per day i can tell you the system will be soonly tested LOL.  for the moment the only one which resist to the struggle is AF4 revised... The others never resisted to the fire except may be AF4 which i kepts for 15 day but let finaly because it was hard to maintain. <br>Anyway I love Mark systems and this forum for 2 reasons<br>1. because they are on paper<br>2. Because whatever happen we all share together and try to find the best way to do things even it is often like looking for the graal. :-)))</div>

<div class="content">Allison:  My post was mostly tongue-in-cheek.  <br><br>Mark is making some unprecedented claims about SAFv3, and is also taking an unusually long time between "announce" and "release".  Part of that is just for fun, and part of it is marketing -- and in any case, I thoroughly enjoy Mark's suspense-building techniques.  :-)    It's fun!!   And it makes for a more interesting list!!<br><br>But with Mark's unprecedented success with SAFv3, and Mark's unprecedented claims, and Mark's not opening up the system for "beta testing" (at least not as early as with the other AF systems) -- it seemed to me that ***Mark*** might want to put it through some extra rigor.<br><br>Like Alan said, "there is the concern that his context doesn't correlate with others", and these were just some (fun) ideas for "stress testing" the system under some different (and typically difficult) circumstances.</div>

<div class="content">At the end of the day, guys, each one of us fills 24 hours a day with some sort of activity and not a second more and not a second less.</div>

<div class="content">Yip.  And the question of interest is to how to decide moment by moment which activities get in.  This question is complicated by the frequency of new tasks, perceived as urgent and important, pressing to get in.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry Seraphim - I probably need a humour upgrade at the moment!</div>

<div class="content">Mark wrote:<br><<<At the end of the day, guys, each one of us fills 24 hours a day with some sort of activity and not a second more and not a second less.>>><br><br>Yes, of course.  If someone is already implicitly aware of this fact, and is really good at pre-filtering things so that "extra" stuff doesn't get onto the list, then one really wouldn't need much of a TM system to help sort it all out.<br><br>One thing I'm looking for in a TM system is to help me sort this stuff out -- to systematically teach me the habits of saying NO and of realizing the limitations on what I can really do.  <br><br>DWM was very good at this.  More than any of the other systems, it helped curb this tendency of mine to take on too much, and it helped teach me better habits and better ways of evaluating new commitments.   <br><br>I guess I'm wondering how SAFv3 handles this -- hence the "stress test" ideas.   If SAFv3 requires a "you only have 24 hrs in a day" pre-filter, that will limit its effectiveness for me.</div>
