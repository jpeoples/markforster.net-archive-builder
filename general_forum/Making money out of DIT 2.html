<div class="content">Depends on the content.  How long?  What's the table of contents?  For eBooks, I generally expect about 20 pages, and would pay a couple dollars [to you, that's 1 pound] on the rare occasion I find the topic useful.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Mark,<br><br>bought DIT today from Amazon for 9.98 EUR.<br><br>Let's say DIT2 ist just a supplement for DIT (so you need to buy DIT for fully understanding DIT2). The price range i think would be fair is 5.99 EUR - 7.99 EUR, assuming the ebook has more than 10 pages of real content.<br><br>If DIT2 is a complete book on it's own, i would be willing to pay 9.99 - 12.99 EUR.<br><br>If DIT2 is a supplement for DIT plus all the collected wisdom from your webpage and forum, i would pay up to 9.99 EUR.<br><br><br>scameronde</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I wholeheartedly echo David and Avrum's comments. Other than that it would be difficult to estimate an appropriate price without details of the product being offered.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-01-25 16:26</div>
<div class="content">I fear you're right Mark.  Although I would pay more for your particular book, eBooks aren't big money makers unless they are marketed, or funnel people into some other money maker.  You need to get a bigger audience somehow.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-01-25 16:31</div>
<div class="content">"You need to get a bigger audience somehow."<br><br>This is true. But Mark seems to lack the required narcissism and new-age charisma to draw in a large audience.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-01-25 16:31</div>
<div class="content">I would pay $20 for your average paper book.  Free 1-chapter eBooks are a good way to advertise that book.<br><br>Tell a little about your system, explain something useful, and then promise the real book has the rest.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-01-25 16:35</div>
<div class="content"><<would pay a couple dollars [to you, that's 1 pound]>><br><br>You would pay about 1,60$/1 pound? A little on the cheap side, don't you think?  scameronde's prices seem more realistic.<br><br>Anyway, Mark, if you're concerned about the relation between effort and profit, you can still simply put up a paypal donation button and be done with it. Your regulars will donate generously, newcomers may donate more or less generously when they like what you offer them here. It's better than nothing and comes with minimal effort on your part.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Andreas. <br><br>I'm sure I received much, much more than $50 worth of benefit from AF (and this site). However, for now, I'd be willing to donate $50 & I'm in the process of purchasing DIT.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>Thanks for the renewed suggestion re Donations Button. I'll give it some thought.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - I'd be willing to pay £5 for the instructions - I would only be expecting instructions similar to those produced for AF, not a full e-book.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-01-25 17:43</div>
<div class="content">One thing to consider is that there are a lot of lurkers on here that just read but don't feel like they have a lot to offer (and thus don't post) but would gladly donate.<br><br>I guess since I'm posting here I might as well give my two cents on what I think you should do.<br><br>1.  Publish the instructions (let's say as a 5 page ebook) with a suggested minimum donation (e.g. $5) I think this is really important, many people won't donate if they don't have an amount.<br>2.  Ask people to only spread the instructions via the website or if they summarize in a blog post to also include a link for more details and donations.<br>3.  Finally (and here's the key to making this a success) tell everyone that you will work on a full book (self or publisher published) if you get a certain number of minimum donations(say 1000 or 5000 or whatever.)  This can act as kind of a publisher's advance by giving you upfront cash, while also showing you that enough people are interested to justify the time and effort put in to a real book.  This also makes all the regulars feel empowered since they can go out and tweet about it to encourage people to read the instructions (and hopefully donate) in order to get a potential book out of it.<br><br>Anyway just some thoughts.  Hopefully you can derive something of value here.  And thanks again to you Mark for the systems and also to all the regulars for the great discussions!<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Regarding "there are only about 20-30 regulars" -- Are you basing that on who comments or statistics from your site?  I've only posted twice but I check the site daily.  I wonder how many other lurkers are here?  You might have a wider audience than you think.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all for the suggestions. Perhaps we'd better keep the discussion for when I actually have some instructions to sell! At the moment it's still very much a work in progress.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I do believe that you are deserving of compensation for your great insights and tinkering.  However I would also be hesitant to push the e-book thing for a couple of reasons.  First, releasing systems free does not create nearly the expectation that someone who pays may expect.  I'm not talking strictly about forum members, but potential new members and the public at large.  We all see you creating new things, tinkering with them and understand the amount of time that goes into it-someone who stumbles upon the ebook and buys it will not have that background.  As you've conceded before, one time management system doesn't do it for everyone and AF certainly didn't work for me.  <br>Second, although you test these systems, I think you'd agree that they become better when done open source so others can troubleshoot them and find problems.  <br>Maybe the happy medium is a brief period where it is free to download or a donate button as others have mentioned.</div>

<div class="content">Regarding expectations - I have the Zen-to-done ebook.  It's pretty fullsome - I edited it into Word becuase I wanted to print it out and read it and make notes and it comes to over 35 pages of text. I was very happy with what I got for my money. I think it is all about managing people's expectations.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-01-25 19:30</div>
<div class="content">I think it's challenging for some people to pay for "value received" from something such as an eBook versus the "size" of that same thing (e.g. page count, chapters, etc.).  A 5-page eBook may not be worth $5, if you can buy a 50-page eBook from someone else for the same price.  But the value received from a 5-page Mark Forster eBook could easily offer over $500 in value to the reader, if taken to heart.<br><br>In reality, I expect most productivity eBooks available today fall short of their authors' revenue expectations, and just create another mess to be managed by their own productivity system. :-)<br><br>Charging for something that used to be free can also polarize Mark's fan base.  I understand that DIT was not free, but AF is, and Mark would likely take a hit in popularity from the casual visitor.<br><br>Better to sod it and enjoy a stress-free retirement...</div>

<div class="content">Mark - You could open a thread inviting all 'lurkers' to send a post letting you know they're there, and asking how often they read the forum? Or would that overwhelm the system (as I expect there are lots)?  It would be an interesting exercise, whether or not you used the information to decide about charging.   For my part, I'd be more than willing to give a donation and/or buy the DIT2 book if you write one.   Best wishes.</div>

<div class="content">I actually sold my ebook which was 11 pages for $5 us and made a reasonable amount of sales.  When I look back at the time spent writing, editing and promoting, I am sure I lost money, but it was a fun and valuable experience.<br><br>Mark it is pretty easy to use some of the ebook and pdf file hosts which charge either a small flat fee or percentage of sales.  Once it is set up it can sell forever via a link.<br><br>I decided to make all of my content free as the time management niche is hard to monetize unless you do the full blown GTD route with an organization, DVDs, training and a series of books etc and really promote it.  Someone on here told me simplicity does not sell well and they are right.  When you tell people to be a GTD black belt takes two years versus using my simple system on a legal pad or  AF or DIT, you loose lots of people who like the "cache" of GTD and the complexities of it.<br><br>That said, I would gladly pay or donate up to $10 for the new instructions as to me it is not the length of the content but the quality of the ideas that matter.  Mark has given enough away for free to convince me his ideas are very worthwhile and to buy DIT and I will gladly pay for the next set of ideas. <br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

Ask people for their e-mail and country, give them an opportunity to subscribe to the newsletter and don't just offer a donation button, but integrate it within the process from putting the download in your shopping basket till downloading the book.

<div class="content">Yes, I am an occasional lurker/poster and would be willing to make a good donation for the DIT2. BTW, did anyone happen to notice the price for "How to Make Your Dreams Come True" on AmazonUS? $165 new and $69 used. I ordered it from AmazonUK for 20usd, now I see the price has gone up. Not bad for a time management book. I'm guessing it's out of print in the US. Good Luck with DIT2! Looks like you have a good following.
