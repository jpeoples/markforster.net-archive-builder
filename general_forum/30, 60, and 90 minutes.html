<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Other discussions on this forum have talked about lengths of time to work on projects or tasks.<br><br>I've recently adopted coach Garrick van Buren's 30-60-90 minute framework. He explains it on his blog at https://garrickvanburen.com/30-60-90/ (with a handy 2x2 matrix that we productivity types love).<br><br>The breakdown is:<br><br>- 30 minutes for a small, known* task.<br>- 60 minutes for a small, unknown task.<br>- 60 minutes for a large, known* task.<br>- 90 minutes for a large, unknown task.<br>- Tasks taking longer than 90 minutes should be broken up into more smaller, more specific tasks.<br>    *known = something you’ve done before and can confidently complete within minutes<br><br>When planning my day, I've found this breakdown to be pretty useful and accurate when estimating what I can get done in a day. I do not hyperschedule every hour of my day, but I do know what usually needs to be done and, if it's a familiar or unfamiliar task, about how much time to allot it. They serve as good rules of thumb.<br><br>I will usually allot either 30 or 60 minutes to churn through items on my task list, and that feels about right.</div>

<div class="content">That was an interesting read.<br>I've been having some success with timeboxing my work into 45 minute units for a few days now.</div>
