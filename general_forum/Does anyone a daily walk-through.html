<div class="content">Today I was concentrated on one important task, doing almost nothing else. In the evening, I felt the impulse to go through all pages to make sure I did not overlook something.<br><br>Is this un-trusting the system? Or reasonable?<br><br>I had the idea that maybe it would be useful to go through all lists one time in the mornung to look for tasks that jump to my eye as "do me today" and to write these on the famous index card. Is anyone doing this? Is this a useful routine or am I breaking the closed lists principle?<br><br>Any comments welcome.</div>

<div class="content">I do something similar AndreasE.  If I go two days without making it through all my active pages I scan all of them for must-do items.  If I find a few I move them to the last page, mark the 'old' ones as done, and begin work on that last page.</div>

<div class="content">I do that quite often, in particular if I have busy days full of meetings or time-bound work where I nearly don't work from the list. It is a fun activity when commuting and nothing for reading is urgent. And, of course, if I come across an urgent task, it goes on the famous index card.<br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">The instructions say that you should read the whole list through whenever you have been away from it for an extended period. I would also recommend reading it through whenever you feel that you have lost track of what's on it for whatever reason.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Just for clearness' sake: Did I get the initial instructions right - and your comment here - to mean that I go through all active pages (i.e. "the whole list") whenever I have been away from it for an extended period of time?</div>
