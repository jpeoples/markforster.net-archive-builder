<div class="content">This forum is quite a gold mine of actionable information. Mark's approach to time management is unlike any other guy out there.<br><br>Each of Mark's systems has an attribute unique to that particular system such as the 'intuition' in AF1 , 'Closed Lists" in DIT, 'Structured Procrastination' in FV etc. A lot of the commentators here must have tested most if not all of the systems mentioned here.<br><br>If so, then which system would you all say encourages "starting" the most? Which system would be the most conducive to build momentum or an upward spiral easily?</div>

<div class="content">Jeb:<br><br>Thanks for the question. I hope it will start a good discussion.<br><br>For the record I think the most useful general system for both the requirements you mention is the original Autofocus. It is an easy system to use, is motivating, self-limiting - and I personally can use it for long periods without getting tired of it.<br><br>It's only limitation is that it's not good with urgent tasks. But this is easily overcome by using the rule "If it needs doing now, do it now."</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I agree that AF1 is the best system for pushing oneself out of a slump. My usual combo is combining methods such as halving and timeboxing with AF1 to keep going.<br><br>The system works brilliantly if one follows the rules regarding dismissal to the letter. Otherwise it just degenerates into a never ending long list, that is finally abandoned in frustration.<br><br>Am eager to know the opinions of others.</div>

<div class="content">My recent forays have shown me that if you want to start momentum, No Lists are hard to beat.  Don't know much about their sustaining momentum though.  I would say one of the best of them is the Next Hour of Your Life,<br><br><a href="../blog/The Next Hour of Your Life.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/7/2/the-next-hour-of-your-life.html</a><br><br>If you have a lot of tasks that need to be started and you do not know how to, Randomizer cannot be beat.<br><br><a href="../blog/Random Time Management.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html</a><br><br>I am curious though, how did you find Mark Forster's forums and website?</div>

<div class="content">I stumbled upon Mark;s first book(GED) on Amazon and since the title looked interesting, I bought it. It was unlike the generic  and "one size fits all" productivity advice that you find online nowadays.<br><br>A simple google search of Mark's name revealed this blog and the forums to me. As far as No-List systems are concerned they are indeed useful in urgent situations and a tool that I use frequently for projects.But I doubt their usefulness in approaching a task that I am resisting strongly.<br><br>I've always been a lazy and disorganized person since high school and have always required the support of systems, structures and forcing functions that make it easier for me to do the right thing. I hate muscling through work with pure willpower and hence am a great fan of Mark's approaches.</div>
