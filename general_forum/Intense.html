<div class="content">I very rarely get a cold, but I've got one now.  The same think happened to Mark F, also some weeks after immersion in SuperFocus.   <br><br>It could be a fluke, of course.  But I wonder if the addictive, immersive quality of Superfocus may not be a cause of overstretch, and whether special precautions may not be valuable to stop one's mental and physical condition getting fried.</div>

<div class="content">Working too hard is always a cause of stress deteriorating health. It's important to rest occasionally and relax. I recommend days of not working the list.<br><br>I haven't tried but it might make sense to add "how do I feel?" to SF, and also stuff like "relax a while, it's going to be fine".  With SF there's always something to do, but sometimes not-doing is a good choice.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps we should also add "Have I blinked recently?", "Am I breathing?", "Do I stink and need to take a shower?, "Am I hungry?", "Am I thirsty?"...SF3 can definitely manage all of our activities.<br><br>(said with sly grin)<br><br>:-)</div>

<div class="content">SF doesn't need to be filled with intensive work tasks.   You can also put recreational things on there.   Mark's 9-mile walks are a good example.</div>

<div class="content">I had been working 3 days without a chance to even look at the list when I followed that with a day where I didn't get enough water drunk (less than 1/2 what I normally drink in a day) and got sick the very next day with another low fluid day, slightly better than the one before but still below par.  In my case I can't say it was SF that caused it as I was resting from that, but possibly the stress of my other job had something to do with it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark's rule is "Don'r put it on the list if you would do it anyway". Do if you find that you're a smelly dehydrated, stressed out mess then yes, do put some appropriate activities on the list.<br><br>Although the superfocus rules talk about "tasks", I decided on "activities" above: it is not all work.</div>
