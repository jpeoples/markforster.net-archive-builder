<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-9 2:12</div>
<div class="content">I started on Monday, with two lists:  a work list & a home list.  My work list started slowly as I have many repetitive tasks and a lot of reactionary type work, but I think it's starting to work for me (thanks to some of your clarifying comments here).  However, the home list is a disaster.  <br><br>I seem to have some kind of trauma with master task lists from past attempts with GTD - the last time I wrote one list of everything that I had to do, it was about 10 pages long and freaked me out so much that I got nothing done and just felt awful for months.  For me, home is challenging as I have very, very little unscheduled time yet a lot of tasks.  But as far as AF goes, just the thought of listing everything has me frozen with stress.  Any suggestions for how to deal with this?  <br><br>Many thanks, Lisa F.</div>

<div class="content">I appologise up front for the long reply and you are free to jump to the end <br><br>:))   JUST write the list.  And the first item can be ""write the list""  then stop if you need to.<br>I found I was scared to write on the list as well, as previous experience was like you, pages of stuff to do... I became imobilised and overwhelmed and gave up. <br>But AF seems to work for me and I'll give you an example of what happened to me.<br><br>We need to rip up our carpets and recover?? or varnish?? or lino?? or carpet?? aahhh by this time I'm stressed, let alone sorting out which of the millions of carpets to choose from..<br>Then what do we do for the 7 cats who grow hair with the main purpose of shedding it on the carpet..<br>And what about the noise and coolness in winter of varnished floors.<br>I think you get the idea of how overwhelmed I turned the job into.<br><br>I listed ""ring about varnish options"" <br>Now this is a job I have done twice before last year and then when I get told all the options AND how hard it is AND we have to be out of the house for a week for the smell and curing etc. I gave up.<br><br>This time I rang around and again started to feel stressed with making a decision<br>Then a bell rang (in my head) that made it totally different.<br>My list said ""ring""  NOT ""make a decision""<br>I totally relaxed, carried on ringing and then listed <br>"" Decide on flooring"" <br><br>A bit spiritual so ignore if you need to... I'm sure AF changes and relaxes the way I think about tasks and this then also releases something that gets stuff done. The next day a supplier returned my call and told me about a natural varnish... no smell... next day can move back in<br>All my problems were solved.<br><br>So I'd say just jump in and write the list and then forget it and just AF your way thru the list.<br><br>Hope this helps and you can get started<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Lisa:<br><br>Margherita has given some sound advice. All I would add is that you don't have to write down everything when you start the list. The method I recommend is to start with a few items and just add items as you think of them or they come up. That way the list grows organically in a non-scary manner!</div>

<div class="content">Lisa - the same thing happened to me on Monday morning. The list was vast, much longer than any list I had ever produced using DIT, and full of all sorts of things that I've been putting off for months (or over a year, in one case). I stuck with it and by Wednesday I had Dismissed about half of the things on the first three pages for a later review and all the urgent and important stuff was getting done. <br><br>Stick with it - it does work.<br></div>
