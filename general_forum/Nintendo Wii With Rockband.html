<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content"><a href=<a href="http://www.offersfine.com/rl_cmprwm.php?ct=706z2><size>2]<b>Get" rel="nofollow">http://www.offersfine.com/rl_cmprwm.php?ct=706z2><size>2]<b>Get</a> your own Nintendo Wii</b></size></a><br>The games console with one of the strangest names on the planet (it's pronounced 'wee') is also one of the most innovative. In fact, with its potential to change the face of the gaming landscape, Wii may be on the verge of a new era, if you'll pardon the pun.<br>The $400 Wii package comprises a square white console unit and stand that plugs into your TV or AV receiver, a wireless sensor bar that connects to the console and receives wireless commands from the battery-powered paddle-style Wiimote controller. Basic composite cables are supplied, but if you have a plasma or LCD the $50 component cable options will deliver better picture quality. The console also supports an SD slot, USB port and a DVD drive for games.<br>Games data can be saved to SD memory cards, which weren't officially released at the time of publication, but in lieu of their arrival, GameCube memory cards will suffice. The USB port can't be used to save games either, but will enable future hardware upgrades such as a hard drive or DVD player, although no announcements have been made to this effect.<br>Despite its DVD drive, the console is not a DVD player (a modification chip is required if you want to watch movies). Nor is it the high definition, hard drive-toting, networked multimedia online multiplayer gaming machine that is the Xbox 360 or forthcoming Playstation 3. Instead, it presents as the most affordable 'next generation' games machine available and, certainly, lacks for no important ingredients if you want to have fun.</div>

<div class="content">I find 15-20 lines works best, although I do end up dismissing a lot of important tasks.</div>
