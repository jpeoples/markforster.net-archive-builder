<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>As you know i hardly struggle to find a working system. I have so many things to do and so many projects that i had a lot of difficulties to find the right thing to do at the right time. <br><br>I finally found something wich works since 3 days and share it immediatly with you ;)) It's the basic method and the beginning of my new organisation. <br> <br>My objective was to colllect and do all my stuff in a real trusted system and be able to handlle it everywhere.<br>So I chose Omnifocus. With it i can manage my projects, i can chose the date to begin things and to put dead line only when it is necessary.<br><br>My secont objectif was to collect my stuff during the day like a Inbox and do things wich i could do in less than 2 mn or urgent things if the need to be done ASAP. <br>I chose AF on paper for it capacity to follow things and intuition processing wich make me efficient on the right tasks. <br><br>Now I explain how i deal with these tools:<br><br>1. During the day i note on my spiral notebook every incoming information and treat them with the AF way. (read twice, report ...) and cross them as they are done. I also note info in omnifocus in the in box if i know that maybe I w'ont do it today...<br><br>2. At night i close AF. I report all undone things in Omnifocus. With dates, comments, links... and cross items in AF.<br>3. Then i do a daily review on omnifocus. Simplify every thing, eliminate unusefull stuff, cross things done, working on my projects in a GTD way. I use flag for every item wich have to be followed during my day, I use + for every item i need to do the next day. I put the name of all person concerned by my items so that i can search easely what's about what when i'll have them on the phone (i have a lot of calls)<br>4. I cross every item in AF so that i will start with a blank page the next morning. I delete and clean all my emails. I report important delay or project name in ical. <br><br>Then all my stuff in in omnifocus. All my projects are followed. All my start & end dates are Ok on omnifocus and during the day i have a + perspective (stuff to do), the search field (for people) the start perspective for everything to start at a date, and a deadline for everything which has a real deadline.<br><br>In the morning when i arrive at my desk i put on paper all my mind items. As i sleept my spirit in creative and goes straight to the point. I put of my brain all stuff wich curse me. <br>then  i make my routine task again treat emails, have a look on my my appointments, read my contexts in omnifocus...<br><br>Then i begin my day and open omnifocus. <br>I read all my context wich are classified by projects add + and flags if necessary<br>report on AF what must absolutly be done. <br>Cross what needs to be<br><br>Then i have on my desk My autofocus spiral notebook with a clean list all my intuition items reported (ideas from the past night) and all my rationnal tasks reported from Omnifocus.<br><br>During the day i treat my AF and context list wich remains open on my computer in the AF way (read twice) rename in OF, report in AF and cross both little by little. <br>If i have to have a look on my project i go on OF all my project is there, plan and clean with all my document linked. <br><br>And when i have finished i just cross all my unusefull items on AF before reporting them on Omnifocus <br><br>I can tell you folks it's a bomb. I can now follow my stuff, take it on appointments and work everywhere with my iphone and omnifocus, sync it with mobileme and do the right thing at the right time. <br><br>What is amusing is that in fact since i do this i never missed an important or urgent item and it bluff my clients when i have them on call and report in 1 mn all the stuff and projects we have together, (just because i put their name in AF ar the right item). <br><br>Hope this will help.</div>

<div class="content">This looks very interesting.  But I think I'll have to read it a few times before I get it.</div>
