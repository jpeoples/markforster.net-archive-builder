<div class="content">Could anyone on the forum who regularly journals share their experience? By 'journalling' I mean writing for a period of, say, 10 minutes without stopping to think, and doing this several times a day. Mark has waxed lyrical about this at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/10/17/road-test-journalling-revisited.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/10/17/road-test-journalling-revisited.html.</a> Before giving this a go I'd like to know how others have found it.<br><br>TIA,<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">I do. Not exactly the way you and Mark describe it, but still based on the morning pages Mark refers to (I stop after one A5 page, which already takes half an hour - I write smaller than usual and even for the usual stuff I get remarks about the size of my writing). One page is done in the morning (that's what traveling in a train is good for ;-) ), and during the day, I add whatever I think about and want to write down.<br><br>Experiences? I can't stop anymore, and I fully agree with Mark's point about avoiding the two extremes.<br><br>About the link in Chris' post: remove the trailing dot to fix it ...</div>

<div class="content">I journal.  I try to do the morning pages, as per the Artist's Way, although I'm not absolutely consistent.  I remember the author saying that you can throw the pages away after writing them if you want, which then puts the focus on the process that you go through in journaling rather than the journal pages as a product.  Although I keep the pages, I try to approach these pages as throw aways, which loosens up my thinking.  I think the point of doing the morning pages is to get things flowing, to get in touch with yourself on whatever level you're present.  I find this extraordinarily helpful.<br><br>I also like to read about other methods or goals of journaling, such as general problem solving and working through work problems.  If I'm blocked about something at work, I might stop and do some journaling on it in my Google docs and have found this also extraordinarily helpful and have been able to work through things this way.  It can release a lot of energy to do this, I've found.<br><br>Here are a couple of other links I find helpful about journaling:<br><a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2004/10/journaling-as-a-problem-solving-tool/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2004/10/journaling-as-a-problem-solving-tool/</a><br><a href="http://litemind.com/journal-to-the-self/" rel="nofollow">http://litemind.com/journal-to-the-self/</a></div>

<div class="content">I journal, but do so for sketching and drawing a la Danny Gregory - <a href="http://dannygregory.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dannygregory.com/</a><br><br>Side note: If you want to draw, but can't, won't, etc., etc., treat yourself to Danny's The Creative License. It's the only book that helped me beat resistance, move beyond stick-figure drawings, and draw for over 3 years (and counting). The book is truly a blessing.</div>

<div class="content">Oh sorry Balfour!  I didn't realize from your link on litemind that it was the same book!   I think I just saw the Steve Pavlina reference and my brain glazed over.  My apologies.<br><br>I used to journal daily, but it seemed to exacerbate my depression and procrastination.  The only way I could make it work as it should was by following a guided book like the Journal to the Self.  Come to think of it, I haven't journaled once since Jan. 5.</div>

One book on my "to-read" list is James Pennebaker's "Writing to Heal: A guided journal for Recovering from Trauma & Emotional Upheaval." He's a psychologist /researcher who has shown that "writing about emotional experiences can have tangible health benefits.' Here is a link to an interesting article about his work and what he recommends (and doesn't) in terms of journaling:<br><br><a href="http://www.utexas.edu/features/2005/writing/" rel="nofollow">http://www.utexas.edu/features/2005/writing/</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum,<br><br>I did not assume that depression was a choice, actually.

<div class="content">And in answer to the OP, I think morning pages are worth trying. I used to do it. But of the many creativity-enhancing techniques out there, I can only choose a few. I opt for meditation, mind-mapping and the odd journal entry when the spirit moves me. I used to burn up all my writing drive in morning pages, and not end up writing the things I wanted to/needed to; and I never seemed able to mine the pages for ideas later on; life was too full and I didn't enjoy returning to them. YMMV - give it a go and see.<br><br>In addition, the whole Artist's Way wasn't for me in the end. She tells you to do exercises like take yourself on a weekly Artist's date. At the time I lived alone, worked alone, and didn't need to do one more thing alone. She says her morning pages are her meditation. I'm sorry, but though they may alter consciousness, for me they can't replace the power of meditation. For someone who has trouble thinking divergently/acting spontaneously/ or other barriers I can't think of, it would be great. For me, I needed to stop doing Artist's Way, and actually do art. <br>Sorry for my negativity - it really was this strong a realisation for me at the time.</div>

<div class="content">Savitri,<br><br>I have to agree that meditation is perhaps the most powerful tool in my kit.  It stabilizes my life and keeps me focused, centered, and aware of what is important.<br><br>I never did get the artists way thing either.  I have not identified why, it just seemd a bit contrived.  It worked for her but I just did not see how it would work for me.<br><br>And your last observation is really golden.  "If you would be a writer ... write!"  It is so obvious.</div>

<div class="content">OBTW, one way in which journaling really helps is when I have strong dreams.  The whole "state depending memory" business wipes out any good information I get from dreams a few moments after I awaken.  If I start describing the dream IMMEDIATELY, it transitions the thoughts into the fully awake state so I can have them there and think more about what they are telling me.  Very helpful at times.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting subject, certainly with the, dreaming - first thing in the morning, aspect that brings it closer to automaticity. But I think that automaticity is a (interesting) technique of the past.<br><br>"Too often, uncoached free writers grow unable to move beyond their daily journal entries to more formal prose.

<div class="content">Mike, I do agree that dream journalling can be a powerful process. It doesn't fit my lifestyle right now, but if I have a very impressive dream, I try to capture some images of it in a journal. I also think there are times in life when we are closer to the unconscious - I journalled when I was pregnant, but haven't recently. Maybe I should! It doesn't have to be Morning Pages.<br><br>I have also used a dream image as central image in a mindmap with really profound results. The dream and the essay I was working on seemed to interact, and the mindmap drew that all out; also helping me retain the rich feeling of the dream - and in a more pleasurable way for me than just writing.<br><br>Damien, that's very interesting - who's Boyce? I think this used to be the case for me; being stuck at free-writing.</div>

<div class="content">>> but if I have a very impressive dream, I try to capture some images of it in a journal<br><br>Ah, dreaming. It's a sad state of affairs that most psychotherapy programs ignore dreams.  Hell, my wife finished a 5 year psychiatry program - in a hospital that supports psychodynamic psychotherapy - without learning much about dreams. <br><br>I never paid much attention to dreams. However a year or so before I got married, I had a particular anxious/troubling dream. I was very fortunate to have a therapist who was trained in, and respected, dream work. He taught me not to get too caught up in the content, stick with the emotive texture, and ponder the events leading up to the dream. Moreover, because we worked together for a couple of years, he had a solid understanding of the snares and goblins with which I struggled. It would not be too preposterous to suggest that one disturbing dream, and a qualified therapist, provided a commitment-phobic mid-30s male to cautiously embrace emotional intimacy. The result: Married in 2006 to, what I believe is, my bashert - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashert." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashert.</a> <br><br>Cue sappy orchestral score.</div>

<div class="content">Savitri <br><br>I misspelled Robert Boice, among other grammatical ... surprises.  The excerpt is from "Procrastination and blocking" (an academic study of productive and blocked academic writers), although my guess is that his main research on automaticity and free-writing is older, as it is just mentioned over two pages.<br></div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>I always thought dream analysis was dumb.  And I still do, the way some people do it.  I don't believe that dreams have a universal "language", and yet there is a kind of universality to some elements.  I think that the closer you get to basic emotions in a dream the closer you get to a "message" of some kind.  I do believe that Freud had it right when he uttered that famous cigar line.<br><br>I think dream work is most successful if you (as a therapist) don't analyze it but just ask the patient what HE thinks it all means.  After all it is HIS dream so HE is probably best qualified to say what it means.  It is also likely that he will miss the obvious point of it some times, but sometimes all it takes is a few well phrased questions.<br><br>As for my dreams, they seem to come from two sources that I can think of right now.  Either I'm struggling with something in my life and I'm getting feedback from my subconscious; or I've been trying to solve some kind of intellectual problem ... and that really amounts to the same process so maybe it is actually only one source.<br><br>Sometimes I'll wake up thinking: "WOW, what a bizarre dream that was.  Who knew elephants could fly Boeing 74s's"  I will wonder about that a moment and then forget it.  Most often, I'll remain in a quasi sleep state as I am about to wake up ... it seems for hours while some long thing plays out.  It is those that are the most interesting to me.  They usually have the answer to something I've been puzzling over.  If I don't keep them going as I wake, they are lost.  So I start writing immediately, going over and over the story line until I'm fully awake and the story is now part of my waking sate and I can properly analyze it.<br><br>Interesting stuff.</div>

<div class="content">>> I always thought dream analysis was dumb.<br>Yowzee, tell us how you really feel Mike :) I'd say that people who analyze their dreams vis dream dictionaries aren't aware (or have access to) the more subtle forms of dream work. <br><br>>> I don't believe that dreams have a universal "language", <br><br>I agree. The metaphors and symbols that appear in our dreams have to do with our cultural/environmental surroundings. Hence, living in an urban city, it is rare that snakes and horses would appear in my dream. <br><br>>> you (as a therapist) don't analyze it but just ask the patient what HE thinks it all means<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Mike... it would seem we have much more in common than our previous discussion would suggest. <br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks to everyone for this rich seam of experience and information. I'm now starting to do what I knew I'd have to do anyway: try it for myself. I've made it my current initiative, in my standard way: assigning 15 minutes at the beginning of the day for a five-day stretch, and then seeing where to go from there. And this first morning has just consisted of thinking around the topic - running way over the 15-minute limit - and reading over this thread, and generally psyching myself up to launch into the activity. I'll let you know how it goes. <br><br>I'm intrigued by the negative - or at least, less positive - experiences of journalling. I suppose I feel they give me permission to opt out of the activity later without feeling I've mis-handled something that any right-thinking person should benefit from.<br><br>I'll let you know how it goes.<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br>Chris</div>

There are many reasons people journal:<br><br>- Develop creativity (Artist's Way)<br>- Keep track of life's events<br>- Record personal development<br>- Record travel experiences<br>- Analyze dreams<br>- Think about and solve problems<br><br>I believe that if you understand WHY you want to journal, you'll know better HOW you want  to do it and WHAT to expect of the experience.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris, <br><br>Just to clarify, I don't think journaling is at all bad in any way.  However, I'm an Enneagram type 5, and that type tends to "go inside" when under stress.  That would lead me to ruminate and withdraw further from the world and into my own mind and I'd build mountains out of molehills - which free-journaling made worse.  That's why I would suggest guided journaling for anyone who has that tendency.  For a couple of years, I also did a simple evening journal technique of listing and writing about everything I was grateful for.  That was a great experience.  Ruminative, yet in a positive way.<br><br>I also did sentence completion every morning for another couple of years based on Nathaniel Branden's books.  It was tremendously helpful, I can't say enough good things about it.  It should take about 10 minutes a day.  Here's an example:<br><br><a href="http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/instructions.html#" rel="nofollow">http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/instructions.html#</a><br><br>For anyone who's interested in having more vivid dreams, I found melatonin is a dream enhancer.  You use it to fall asleep more easily - unfortunately that's not my problem when it comes to sleep :-), and it boosts serotonin levels.  When using it, it was the only time I would even remember my dreams.  Sadly, they weren't as fascinating as elephants flying airplanes.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike - and also Jim, whose post I saw just after writing what's below:  thanks for this. I decided to answer by doing this morning's journalling as a response. Here it is - but minimally tidied up for intelligibility and because I can't bear to show my typos to the world:<br><br>---<br><br>Mike suggests several possible motives for wanting to journal and suggests I get clear about why I want to do it before I set out on the practice. Well, the one that rings true, I think, is solving a problem - the problem of self-reflection, of getting an overview of myself, my life and where I'm going. It's all too easy to live from day to day and from task to task, without drawing [I meant "consulting"!] a roadmap - or without even drawing one to begin with.  It's especially easy with a TM system like AF, which enables me to process and dispose of all sorts of ideas, projects and provisional or tentative goals and feel clear and light about the way they're being handled. If I forget to include the task "Stand on mountain-top and survey my life", I may never notice the lack. In fact, I see journalling as leading into regular diary-keeping, which I've only practised fitfully throughout my life.<br><br>As for creativity, which Mike also mentions as a possible aim of journalling -  well, I suppose I imagine that I'll always be able to find ways of being creative in any particular project I take on. But I'm not sure that's necessarily true.  Take the case of guiding at XYZ. Being sunk in the mire of preparing for it, I'm not doing it with the simple efficiency and practicality that I always find it so easy to imagine myself commending to someone else. Obvious cue for an exercise: imagine myself as Head Guide, giving advice to a starter like me.<br><br>---<br><br>I typed that with the PC screen switched off. It came out like this - a bit formal, a bit over-polished. Well, writing is my trade, and I was conscious of addressing the piece to this thread of the forum. So it's not actually a piece of let-it-rip, full-blooded journalling!<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Chris<br><br>Thanks so much for taking the risk in revealing what's in your journalling.<br><br>It may help you for me to say that the drift of your journal is to become objective, to take an overview of your life, to detach and look back at yourself as from the point of view of another.<br><br>You may find that it is even more helpful and revealing to you if you are more subjective:  What's actually going on in me at the moment?  How would I name my true feelings?  Let me articulate these "inner stirrings".<br><br>If you sense there might be value in this approach, I would not encourage you to share it on the forum.

<div class="content">Jim hit the nail on the head, I think.<br><br>One other thought: do you think you might benefit by a traditional goal setting exercise?  I benefited greatly from following exactly the program in Allan Lakein's book.  I did that in the very early '70's and it has made all the difference.  I have updated my long term goals list every year on my birthday and I consult it monthly when I do my monthly review.<br><br>In case you've not read about it it is quite a thorough exercise.  It takes several days of work (on and off, leaving some time for percolation) to get the list in good shape, then much longer to hone it to a fine edge ;-)<br><br>I won't describe the exercise here (unless you really want me to) but the output of it is a prioritized list of your long term goals.  Being who I am (of course ;-) MY output was that list broken down by time period into the following periods:<br><br>- Lifetime<br>- 20 years<br>- 10 years<br>- 5 years<br>- 3 years<br>- 2 years<br>- 1 year<br>- 6 months<br>- 3 months<br>- Next Month<br>- This Month<br>- Next Week<br>- This Week<br><br>As you can see, I spend a lot of time in the present looking at goals which drive my current task list, but those are derived from the longer time periods.  My weekly review centers on the last three buckets and my list of current projects and actions.  My priorities are top down and kept in alignment by my monthly review which looks at the whole structure and concentrates on the yearly and monthly time frame.<br><br>So, as a concrete example:<br><br>At the top I might have broad generalizations about living an adventurous life.  The I ask myself what I mean by that and it would generate some goals in the 20 year time frame (like maybe "Climb Mt. Everest ;-).  But what would I have to do by the 10 year mark to make that happen?  And so on.  As it gets more near term (one year or less, mostly) I am in what would be called the "project" level.  And projects have monthly milestones which I can only reach by completing some things this week or next ... and then I'm at the action level.  So, what I am going to do today is governed by my long term goals or life's necessities.  For example, my schedule for today is:<br><br>- Read for about four hours (which is in my lifetime learning program, in general, and some specific sub goals in particular ... such as languages and history)<br><br>- Go to hardware store for materials for project which will improve my home which leads to happiness with my current living environment as well as equity appreciation which leads to long term financial goals<br><br>- Mop the kitchen floor -- which I can link back in a similar way but really just comes down to those pesky things one has to do ;-)<br><br>O.K.  I hear the chorus laughing that no one plans their life that far in advance ... after all, things change and who would want to plan for what might never happen?  Well, I do, and I can tell you that my lifetime goals have been remarkably stable and I'm on track for most of them.  Some have now changed in scope a bit.  (Age takes it toll ;-)  But in some incarnation or other, my goals have either been accomplished or I'm on track to accomplishing them.  Now, when they are hauling my remains off to a hole in the ground somewhere will they be saying "Poor sap, he enver did reach  his goal of climbing Mt. Everest!"?  Yes, I'm sure some will see it that way.  But I'm reminded of Feynman ... "Tuva or Bust!"  I really got that!  LOL ;-)<br><br>The whole point of goals is not to reach them, but to journey toward them.<br><br>Just some early morning ramblings ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Jim, Mike - <br><br>In haste (gotta get to bed) - thanks for your thoughtful replies.<br><br>Jim - don't worry - I won't be journalling in public!<br><br>Mike, I'm impressed by your ability to carry through with that top-down planning. I've given up on that so many times  -  I couldn't even face weekly reviews. It's been a relief to discover the AF approach.That's not to say I'll never check out Allan Lakein.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I've been following this discussion w/ keen interest ! (Learning: hope you are feeling better!! Also following your thoughts on the other thread very closely!) <br><br>Through the years I've done intense journalling on and off. Currently, for getting a grasp on my own "bigger picture" I've been using mindmaps (Novamind) to do my journalling and just keep reviewing and growing my mindmaps so I can "see" better. Some issues look differently from one day/week/month to the next and "journalling" via a mindmap really helps me to view a particular problem over time .. seeing the challenges which come up, the solutions I've tried, the progress, insights or complications I see now which I couldn't see before, etc. And the advantage is that I can see it all in a "big picture" format. I particularly like using Novamind because I can have various related maps all in the same file, (just click on a tab to view another) plus the program is flexible enough to be able to add long text blocks (which can be hidden or not) and of course they can be as large as I want. <br><br>Anyway, thanks to everyone for their contributions to this very interesting discussion!</div>

<div class="content">I journal daily using a form I learned from Mark's book 'How to make your dreams come true'.<br><br>I dialog with my 'future' self. The 'present' me writes about my dreams, aspirations and worries. My future self (who is wise and detached) responds by making observations and asking questions.<br><br>It sounds mad I know, but it is very effective and produces surprising insights and solutions I never knew I had in me! Its great fun too.<br><br>My dad passed away recently and I realised that a large part of my 'future' self's personality was modelled on my father. That could be good or bad - I think its good as my father was one of the wisest men I knew.<br><br>Respect<br>Paul<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Paul<br><br>I too have found Mark's "future self" methods incredibly helpful - journalling in that way really does produce a lot more insight than "reflective contemplation" (or whinging!)</div>

<div class="content">"I suspect more than one!! "<br><br>True. Though two of the largest schools of non-dynamic psychotherapy (CBT & Family Systems Therapy) were founded by therapists who were analysts (Dr Murray Bowen) or influenced by pscyhoanalysis (Dr. Albert Ellis). <br><br>I always get a chuckle when my marital clients report that they've turned into their parents. The very thing they SWORE wouldn't happen.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>I spent a few days in a beach condo with my parents last week & my husband said that I reverted back to childhood where I was cooking & cleaning the whole time I was there.  <br><br>Wow, there's something I could journal on for days!  :-)<br><br>Thanks for this thread.  It gave me quite a few new ways to journal that I had never thought of before.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to everyone for their contributions to this thread. I've just read over the 10-minute journallings that I've done first thing in the morning over the past few days, and it's reminded me of the value of diary entries of any kind. They're full of detail that I'd already forgotten in that short span of time. <br><br>They're quite conventional pieces of prose - not the sort of wild stream of consciousness I expected and rather hoped for. But then, I haven't yet tried any of the suggestions made by people above.  And their value as fragments of memory remains. <br><br>The problem now is that I only have one beginning-of-the-day slot each day and other initiatives will be filling it. So I will have to use Autofocus principles to make diary entries sporadically but reliably, if I can. <br><br><br>Chris</div>
