<div class="content">Michael B:<br><br>Has it actually been produced yet? My experience of kickstarter campaigns is that they are either extremely disappointing when they finally arrive or never arrive at all. Therefore I don't support them any longer, which is sad.<br><br>I also think I've seen similar advertised as a normal commercial product though I can't put my finger on it at the moment.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>"Has it actually been produced yet?"<br><br>Looks like prototypes have been produced. The rest ship out this April.<br><br>From Rocketbook's Kickstarter Page: <br><br>"When we launched a second campaign, our planning and conservative estimates paid off and we delivered 4 months early. It was amazing to exceed our backers expectations and that is our goal again for this campaign.<br><br>We have crowdfunded notebooks before and feel we have reduced our risks ahead of time by:<br><br>1. 16 months of research & development to determine the ideal synthetic paper and coating formulation for ideal writing experience and greatest durability <br>2. Creating and socializing prototypes <br>3. Determining raw material providers <br>4. Finalize all quotes for our first production run funded by this Kickstarter campaign <br>5. We are already set up with a fulfillment provider who will handle the packing and shipping of rewards and who ships our other products every day."</div>

<div class="content">Notebooks: I alternate between Black n' Red A6 or A5 casebound, and Clairefontaine 1951 A6, a wonderful soft-cover notebook for £1.50.<br><br>Pencil: Pentel P205 mechanical pencil  (about £3-5) with Pentel Ain Stein 4B leads. There is no better mech pencil, in my view, and I own them all. These 4B leads are almost as dark as black ink, and though a true luxury to write with are as cheap as chips.<br><br>Pens: Jinhao fountain pens from Ebay with their nibs replaced by a top-notch JoWo one. As good as fountain pens costing £150 or more, for about £14 all-in.</div>
