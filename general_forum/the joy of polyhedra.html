<div class="content">I was using a randomizer range of 1-20, since I have 20 lines in my pocket notebook.   I ordered an icosahedron (20-sided die) from Amazon, and started using it yesterday.  It DOUBLES the gamification aspect of the randomizer!   It is just so much fun to roll a real 20-sided die, instead of clicking "Again!" on randomizer.org.   It reminds me of my gaming days as a teenager.  <br><br>You can even get a "pound of dice" for $20:  multiple d20, d12, d8, d4, d10, d100, and basically use whatever combination you want.    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chessex-001LBCHX-Pound-O-Dice/dp/B008C0KXYS" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Chessex-001LBCHX-Pound-O-Dice/dp/B008C0KXYS</a><br><br>But a single d20 works fine for me.   I got it as part of a standard set of polyhedra:   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015IPGB4" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015IPGB4</a></div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Agreed!  I'm using the same: 20-sided die and 20-lined notepad. I find using dice adds a novelty factor to the work which, for me, staves off any resistance even that bit further.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Go to any gaming or comic book store. They'll have all sorts of dice for much cheaper than Amazon shipping. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, and "10's" are in the classic kits. "10's" is actually 10-sided 10, 20, 30,...which you combine with the 10 to get 100. You can also get several other sizes. Search for "gaming dice" (and turn on safe-search).<br><br>All the small devices have free dice apps. The Venn diagram of programmers vs gamers has much overlap! Mine lets me define any type of dice, load a dice "bag" (when my rogue throws 5 darts, I throw all 5 darts plus the "to hit" at once) and adjust the outcome (+1 to the total, or +1 to each die, or...). But, yeah, there's something about having one chance in the middle of a heated battle, physically rolling the dice, watching one of them fall off the table onto the bumpy carpet, and debating which side is up.</div>

<div class="content">Ah, I use Amazon Prime so never even thought about the shipping.  Plus, the nearest gaming store is 75 miles from my home.  We get everything but regular groceries on Amazon.  :-)<br><br>Which reminds me...   Mark, have you ever considered adding an "enter Amazon through this widget" to your site?   It's another way to generate revenue and I'm sure lots of us here use Amazon and wouldn't mind the trouble of linking to Amazon through your site.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>Thanks for the opening.  Mark, do you provide a means other than paypal for donations?</div>

But it didn't produce much income so I didn't bother to reinstate it when I weeded out the site margin a couple of years ago.</div>
