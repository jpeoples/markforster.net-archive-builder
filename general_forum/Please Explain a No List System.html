<div class="content">I have read much of the discussions and am having trouble understanding the concept.  If you are writing down things that have yet to be done how is it a no list system?  Realistically, there is no way to know the thing on the "no-list" will in fact be completed.  It seems to me these are just systems with shorter lists.<br><br>Isn't a true no list system just that, using one's memory to decide what to do next without looking at a list of possibilities?  <br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br>No, it's not a matter of using one's memory to decide what to do next. It's a matter of using one's brain to decide what to do next. It's not primarily an exercise in memory; it's an exercise in your knowing what the important things in your life and work are and getting on with them.<br><br>Although it's called "no-list" it's usual (but not essential) to work with a short buffer of not more than five tasks.<br><br>These two blog postings should help you to understand further.<br><br><a href="../blog/What is a no list system.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/12/what-is-a-no-list-system.html</a><br><br><a href="../blog/Effect on the Brain.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/10/effect-on-the-brain.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thanks for the links.  But, in reality when we are deciding what to do next, we are selecting the item from a list which may exist on paper or in our brain unless of course the task just came into existence like your boss just walked into your office and asked you to do something.<br><br>I personally do not mind having a "catch all" list as I like the idea of not having to remember things, it creates too much drain on me.  <br><br>This just may not be the system for me, but glad if it is working for others.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br><<  iI personally do not mind having a "catch all" list as I like the idea of not having to remember things, it creates too much drain on me. >><br><br>I think most people's experience is that having a massive list with more things on it than you can possibly do is pretty draining too. And those who have converted to a "no-list" approach seem to be claiming that they forget to do less things than with the catch-all approach.<br><br>However if you are happier with a catch-all list then stick with it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, Gerry,<br><br>I am still struggling with this.  I think we are essentially shifting the question from "which task should I do next?" to "what task should I do next?". The inputs are necessarily more complex than a simple list of predefined candidates. They will include:<br>- feelings about which of our commitments are at risk (or which are opportunities for overdelivery)<br>- recognised opportunities<br>- upcoming deadlines<br>- energy levels<br>- who and what is available to help<br>- level of challenge<br>- level of fun<br>- perceived resistance<br>- perceived attraction.<br>...<br><br>The goal is more to support focus on individual tasks than to ensure that you get through as many of the right tasks as possible.<br><br>For me, the jury is out. I slightly worry that without more guidance on which tasks to select, we will be at risk from all of the well known biases and dysfunctional heuristics. But I am still questioning, thinking and learning.</div>

<div class="content">Will,<br><br><br>Interesting question. For me the issue is universal capture or not.  For me, the idea that a list exists somewhere with all of what must be done is comforting not overwhelming since I know I have a poor memory.  It would be massively distracting for me to wonder if I will remember that something needs to be done as opposed to knowing that even if I forget the list has it.<br><br>I do think that some type of filtering system to "match" the amount of work to a time frame to complete it is good.  So it seems to me that the unit of a day or even an hour and selecting the amount of work and even listing it can be helpful.  But, I also firmly believe that only we can actually select the next task that needs to be done and no system actually selects it for us unless that system is a random one - like rolling dice or pulling from a hat.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry,<br><br>I suppose the key difference here is that with a no-list system, you only capture things that relate to your commitments in some way. <br><br>You can still have accumulating lists relating to your commitments. but they support your attention focus system rather than driving it.</div>

<div class="content">From Will's list, I found the FVP was particularly good at this (the first two being about acting at the most opportune time, including when someone is available that you need to talk to, etc.):<br><br>- recognised opportunities<br>- who and what is available to help<br>- perceived attraction (with the question "what do I want to do more than X?"<br><br>At least, if you remember something you needed to ask someone while you are reviewing your list while they are nearby.</div>

<div class="content">What I found since moving away from a catch all list to a no list is the following:<br>- I am lot more engaged in what I am doing<br>- More clarity on what I am currently busy with<br>- More deliberate in starting something new<br>- Not being a chained to me to do list<br>- Can visualize what I need to do the next day/week<br>- Building trust in your own intuition and not relying on a list<br><br>My advice is to do jump in and try it out for 2 weeks. Only then can you experience the liberating effect. You need to experience it for yourself and not overthink it.</div>
