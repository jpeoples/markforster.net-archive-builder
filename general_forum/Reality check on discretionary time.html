<div class="content">There's a post on stats started by Lynn, which gave rise to a few questions for me.<br><br>If someone has a home notebook with 25 active pages and 30 tasks per page, and 50% of these tasks are complete, there's a potential 375 tasks remaining to do.  If these tasks take an average of 20 minutes to do - which is probably a fairly conservative estimate, there are 7500 minutes or 125 hours of potential tasks in the book at this time.  That's about 4 hours a day for a month - assuming nothing else was added and no time off of the book was taken.   <br><br>Where am I going with this?  If you didn't want the tasks to linger in the book for over a month, you've got to have either less tasks/things you've committed to or more discretionary time.  If you 've got a regular 50+ hour/week job including commute time - it just isn't possible to commit to a whole lot.  <br><br>I was just doing the math to figure out how to reinforce to myself that dumping tasks into the book is very bad.  Does the logic seem sound to you all?<br></div>

<div class="content">This approach seems to assume that dismissing tasks is something you would seek to avoid wherever possible. Personally, though, I wouldn't want any disincentive to dump tasks into the book because for me, it's crucial to the "mind like water" thing - the sense that I am not relying on my brain to remember stuff I need to do. The solution, surely, is just to be willing to dismiss a huge amount of stuff. (And/or to move it temporarily onto a someday list, which I'm doing, in a GTDish way.)</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Ludlow. I like being able to dump everything in my notebook and letting AF handle them. There used to be a lot of things I knew I wanted to do or felt I needed to do. And I was always beating myself for not getting around to most of them. Putting them in my AF notebook has put them in a new perspective. I've realized I don't want or need to do some of them as much as I thought. I've realized that, realistically, I won't be able to get all of those things done, and that's okay because I'm not Superwoman, and there's only so much I can do. So there's no more beating myself up over every little thing I'm not doing.<br><br>That's the thing. Even if you don't write something down, it'll probably be on your mind somewhere, nagging at you. By writing it down, you get it out of your head and into a place where you can evaluate it, and possibly dismiss it. But it'll still be there for you to reconsider later. (Which is why I like the idea of using physical notebooks, and storing them to look over later.)<br><br>Also, I think if you use AF with the attitude that you are not going to dismiss anything, or that dismissing is somehow bad, you're in trouble. I look at dismissed items as my Someday/Maybe list, only one that was created organically rather than me trying to evaluate things before. Dismissed items are things I might get to at some point (because dismissed doesn't mean deleted), but my mind is telling me it's okay to let them go for now.</div>

<div class="content">I find that a lot of the items on my list take only a few minutes.  Some take longer.  Others take a very long time but are worked on several times and crossed off each time.  While it may look daunting, it may be that you have dumped everything in your life onto your list rather than put on just those things that occur to you as you go.</div>

<div class="content">All I can add is that I have a lot of active pages, a lot of active items, and a few panic items, but I am really not worried by how much I have on my list.  The main thing is that I am making progress - some days I add more than I clear, some days I clear more than I add.  I know that my "problem" is shortage of discretionery time but as that is not changeable I would much rather be working with a system that enables me to get things done rather than with one that doesn't!.<br><br>OK so I still have hundreds of items outstanding but I also have well over 1000 items cleared!  That does it for me!</div>

<div class="content">Oh, I don't have a problem dismissing - I've got over 130 items dismissed already.  Most of them are a " someday I'll " kind of dismiss, a few are decisions I made not to do something period.  However, most of them really didn't belong on the list right now to begin with.  And I've got a lot of stuff done, no complaints from me there.<br><br>I want to achieve peace  through actually resolving issues, not just by identifying them.  I've seen too many re-engineering / restructuring projects with a lot of identification of issues and no resolution.  I've wasted too much of my life daydreaming, planning and thinking and not enough doing.<br><br>Say I put everything into my book and basically do a brain dump of everything that I think I may vaguely feel like doing in the next couple of months (don't laugh - I really did this!)  Having this discordant list of a wide range of tasks (even though many of them were on the same basic project), made me feel more like "mind like raging class 5 rafting river".   Initially, I was euphoric, thinking "wow!  I can get everything done I've ever wanted to do!"  Then reality hit about how little time there actually is unless you want to be working all the time.<br><br>I am trying to follow Mark's advice to not dump into the system but allow it to grow organically - which led me to focus on a specific project within the overall project and get it done.  Seeing a tiny bit of progress but no completion in 100 different areas isn't very motivating.<br><br>I still have a bit of a problem in understanding what Mark means by "organic growth" of the list, since the only place I've heard of organic growth is in the business world and it means to grow via focusing on the core business - increasing sales, cutting costs, improving customer service etc., not growth via mergers / takeovers etc.   So if I take that concept and apply it to my list, I shouldn't be doing an "acquisition" / taking on of another project other than my existing projects unless I have my core business running well enough (ie not much backlog?)  - and if there isn't a vacuum because I've filled it full of 150 hours of things I thought I wanted to do in the next month, then I'd better start dismissing or clearing that backlog.  <br><br>I really don't mind things taking longer than I envision that they should in my 'ideal (unrealistic) world', but seeing that since the day I wrote "garage door opener installation" on Jan. 5, it's been just over 2 months filled with delay after delay is disheartening.  Between trying to find the right opener to the weather being too cold for the door company contractors, it was finally installed 1.5 months after I bought it, but still isn't working properly yet.   It's just confirmation that some things take a longer time to do than you initially think.  If I had had less items on my list though, and only had 10 active pages - I could possibly have crossed it off 2 months ago and been able to park my car in the garage where it belongs since it's been -30.<br>  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>You really should have been crossing off the garage door thing several times, going by what you said.  As soon as you make a call you have "worked on it" and it NEEDS to get crossed off, and rewritten at the end ... possibly reworded.<br><br>By "organically" I think Mark just means that you should not "plan" what you put onto the list, but rather just add things as they come up.  Look, I made the same mistake you did, I did a dump onto the list and that has resulted in some very tough things to handle.  Some of them I just took off again so that I could get the list working as it should.  Now I realize that if I just do "something" on the tough things I can cross them off and put them back on at the bottom.  If nothing else, that mixes them up ... IOW, when I was doing my "dump", things tended to cluster.  I need to work on the attic and there are about a dozen things to do there (add ceiling lights for the top floor, ceiling fans, insulation, wire mesh to keep the critters out, etc.).  So when that occured to me, I about filled a page with todos for that one thing alone.  Bad idea.  Very depressing.  I reworked the list to just have:<br><br>"Work on attic (April)"<br><br>I put the approximate date I want to start work based on the weather.  So now I ignore it because of the date but I'm doing some planning every time I see the item.  Is there something on sale I need at the hardware store?  Are there any good ideas in any of the home magazines?  When will my wife not be out of town on April weekends?  (I'm not dumb enough to go up there and mess with electricity with no backup in case I fry myself ;-)  The real upside is that I don't have to look at line after line of depressingly hard work ahead of me.<br><br>Now, the actual WORK is not lessened, just the psychological impact of the list.  The work on the attic is going to be hard long back breaking hours in a cramped space.  I expect that it will take several partial weekends ... and that is if I plan it right and get my supplies ahead of time.  So I get the disappointment you experience with the garage door.  Nothing fixes that except being able to handle it as best you can and not letting the list itself get in the way.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I agree with Mike that the garage door task should have been crossed off and relisted but perhaps you already did that?  Also agree with the explanation of growing the list organically.<br><br>Basically it is just adding a few tasks to start with as they come to mind.  If you imagine them as seeds you would not want to then stifle them by dumping a whole heap of old soil (backlog) on top.  As you go on and the list starts to grow, you may want to add some compost in the form of a few backlog items, but not too much.  If the tasks start clumping together you might want to thin them out by a few small steps, or by rephrasing and moving to the end of the list.  No doubt a few new ideas will also germinate along the way, adding more colour to your new garden. :-)<br><br>And of course there's always those blue skies you mentioned ..... :-)<br><br>(You can probably tell it's getting late!)<br></div>

<div class="content">Part of this, I guess, is just the unfortunate emotional effect of SEEING the truth about a situation that was there all along - that you want to do more than you have time to do - but that we manage to avoid thinking about too much when we're not using a system like AF! <br><br>Then again, if there's a weak point in AF for me so far, it's that it seems to place a bit too much trust in my intuition - it seems to imagine that if a task is just a bit of pointless filler, something I think might be sort-of-fun-to-do, I will resist doing it and it will be weeded out by the dismissal process. Unfortunately I am perfectly capable of having these filler items "stand out" and take up time! I fear the only solution to this is an occasional review where my rational brain is put back fully in the driving-seat, and decides to park a whole lot of stuff on the back burner (someday list, etc).</div>

<div class="content">I like your idea Mark, it sounds like you're doing a combination of scheduling and AF.  The little and often led to the garage door task being reentered many times, and then because I wouldn't see it for a week at a time, was put off.  It was never an *urgent* job, it just led to the realization that I've had that if I put a large number of things on the list, and therefore end up with a large number of pages, the fact is that I will not get to some of these projects in a shorter time frame - unless I use an approach like the Current Initiative or similar.  <br><br>You're right Ludlow, a lot of what I did was necessary - cleaning, decluttering, etc., but because an item like the garage door was so obvious - and irritating, I know that if I was in *push* mode, it likely would have been done a lot sooner.<br><br>If you guys only knew how many times I have crossed out and reentered "check kijiji for flooring nailer".  Eventually, I'll give up and just buy retail and re-sell it when the job is done. :-)<br><br>On a positive note though, thanks to AF, my new dishwasher arrived today which I had put off buying for about a year - so the *do dishes* task will be gone and will free up some time for other stuff!  Now to make a current initiative to get the darn thing installed... OFF the list - this one's URGENT!<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline it might simply be that you are committing yourself to more than it's sensible to do. Autofocus can reveal that problem. It won't magically solve it!<br><br>It sounds like your garage door lock is simply not a problem for you right now, so every time you look at solving it it feels like a chore -- it won't be a fun job to do, and you subconsciously know that once it's done your life won't be any more fun anyway.<br><br>In such a case, I would simply dismiss the task. Having it on the list is making you feel bad.<br><br>Now if the lock on the garage door really matters then at some point it will occur to you again, and you'll write it on your list again. Eventually, it will get done if it matters. If it doesn't matter, why waste time working on it, or emotional energy feeling bad about it?<br><br>Jacqueline, did you post on another thread about how you were planning some kind of road trip soon, and needed to get the house in good order before you could go? Or am I confusing you with somebody else?</div>

<div class="content">Interesting discussion. <br><br>I'll just remind you what the instructions say:<br><br>"DO expect things to move at different rates. Some things will move fast, some slowly, some will stop for a period, and some will be rejected altogether. This is how it’s supposed to work."</div>

<div class="content">Yes David, I will be selling this house hopefully by December and want to have it completely renovated in that time - it's a big job.<br><br>Mark, I've made good progress in other areas, I haven't just been sitting around twiddling my thumbs like I used to - so I don't mind terribly that this particular project moved along slower than I thought it "should" - I'm just having the feeling that I'm falling behind on the overall schedule and it's worrying me.<br></div>
