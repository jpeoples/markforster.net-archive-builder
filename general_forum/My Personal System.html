<div class="content">Greetings!<br><br>I’m new to Mark Forster and really loving what I’m reading about over the past week<br><br>I thought I’d share a new system that I’ve been using:<br><br>3 Main Lists - each list is kept in a spiral notebook that stays open on my desk<br><br><br>1. Projects: This list shows 1 current big project for work. The 1 page just has tasks associated with this project. Subsequent projects are kept on a running “up next list” on the second page. I personally benefit from a hard limit on active projects to prevent myself for having 5-10 things on the go that don’t get finished.<br><br>2. Routines: This is a simple list of daily/weekly routines that come from the main areas of life I want to put conscious attention into keeping up with. Exercise, Nutrition, Musical Practice, Home Cleaning etc There are 1-2 tasks from each of these areas. This list is sort of like a weekly checklist to keep a birds eye view on these tasks and prevents re-writing them daily.<br><br>3. Admin/General Task List: This list is similar to the DIT task list, and I’ve been using the DIT principles since reading Mark’s book. Just a simple closed list, and using the Manana principle to put tasks into tomorrow.<br><br>The real reason I find this system useful is that whenever I attempt to collapse these three areas into one overarching system or list, I’m less mindful about how I engage with these different areas. By creating 3 distinct categories it makes looking at my day much easier and I can use timeblocks if I need to or just use a more natural approach of rotating which of the 3 buckets I engage with.<br><br>I’ve found that on some days I benefit from a technique where I work on each area for 5-10 minutes and rotate them - or on some days when the feeling is right I can dive into a project block that is much longer, or chain together a series of Routine tasks and knock them down.<br><br>One seemingly trivial but super important part of this system is how having three separate spiral note books that stay open on my desk supports this. I tried running this with everything tucked away in a single notebook or in different spots in Apple Reminders etc but having 3 separate notebooks - 1 dedicated to each category of work really seems to make the system stick into my life better. No opening notebooks or tabs on a computer - the spreads are always available on my desk when it’s time to jump into one of them<br><br>I personally have been quite impressed with how resilient this system is and how straight to the point it is.<br><br>You can probably see how excited I was to find Mark’s work as I’ve naturally played around with many systems that are in the same spirit of his creative approaches to task/time management!<br><br>- Beau</div>

<div class="content">I think this is a good example of working with what works for you.   I have often felt that the advice to have one list to rule them all is difficult.  Having separate lists/notebooks that align with your mode makes sense to me.</div>
