<div class="content">I'm interested in specific things which you have achieved through using AF which you probably wouldn't have achieved if you hadn't used it.</div>

<div class="content">I've accomplished some small to medium-sized projects:<br>1) a multimedia presentation for a big fundraising event<br>2) a paper proposal for an academic conference <br>3) multiple smaller craft projects finished<br>4) reviewed multiple abstracts for an academic conference<br><br>I think for me, though, the bigger difference has come in no longer letting little things slip through the cracks - I'm FAMOUS for procrastinating things like paperwork, e-mails, little errands, and most especially PHONE CALLS.  Those are getting *done* now instead of hanging over my head for weeks at a time.</div>

<div class="content">I don't think I'm necessarily more effective at work, but the contrast between my work life, which worked well and my home life, where I procrastinated constantly has been a source of anxiety and depression for me for many years.  <br><br>In the 4 1/2 YEARS I've lived in this house (which I purchased with the intent to renovate and sell at a profit) prior to AF I accomplished the following:<br><br>- painted 2 ceilings<br>- painted two rooms<br>- painted the front door<br>- finished the front steps<br>- hardwood flooring purchased and sitting in the garage<br>- lights, paint, shelving, various other stuff, bought but never used, sitting in the garage or storage room<br><br>In the 3 months since beginning AF on January 5, I have accomplished the following:<br><br>- large office bookshelves painted - lots of moulding so a fairly time consuming job, also one wall with fairly intricate paneling<br>- two sets of stair railings primed and painted<br>- new dishwasher and 2 toilets installed<br>- new garage door opener installed<br>- carpets removed from 1/2 the house (and carpet tacks too!)<br>- several upstairs rooms painted and lower bathroom as well<br>- laundry room cleaned  <br>- furnace room cleaned<br>- casings and baseboards removed from 4 rooms and halls<br>- popcorn ceiling removed from 1 large room<br>- highly annoying mdf that was screwed AND glued down pulled up from front door entrance<br>- most of the basement painted (about 1200 s.f.).<br>- hardwood flooring acclimating in the house, until I find the nailer I'm looking for<br>- currently working on the main bathroom vanity, I have the old one 1/2 pulled apart<br><br>Other things accomplished at home include:<br> - about 25 trunk loads of donated stuff taken to goodwill or the recycling center (about 1/2 of my book collection too which amounted to a lot of boxes) and at least 10 garbage bags full of clothes as well as all my "baby stuff" disposed of (my baby is 8 years old)<br>- a bunch of stuff disposed of on freecycle <br>- a neater home with the main areas clean or within 5 minutes of being company ready<br>- fulfilled the request of a 2007 tax audit which I had procrastinated on for 5 months prior to AF but got finished within 2 weeks with AF (had to wait for stuff to come in the mail)<br>- current year taxes done and ready to push the button to file online (I don't want to file until my 2007 audit is cleared) - in contrast to last year when I filed late, but justified it because I got a refund<br>- several ski and snowshoing weekends with friends and family (none this winter prior to AF)<br>- entire DVD collection (~300) catalogued and put into binders<br>- watched 2 seasons of Dexter - had the first season for over a year...<br>- started knitting a scarf for a good friend (I've had the supplies for over 2 years)<br>- I've been the first in my neighbourhood to have my sidewalk shoveled rather than the last - sometimes I'm even out there before it stops snowing :-)<br>- a much cleaner car<br>- I've spent more time with my kids and it's been time that's focused more on them<br>- sent my dad's birthday card on time vs. prior years where I would phone him (probably a couple of days late) because I procrastinated<br><br>I do think the qualitative ways my life has improved has been more important in many ways though - I would say my desire to have a glass of wine (or two or three) to relax at home has been reduced to 1/10 of "normal".  I haven't felt cranky or depressed once since I started using AF and this was an almost daily occurrence before.  In fact, I think I avoided being at home as much as possible.  I've been far less introspective in the last 3 months, stopped planning more than I've been doing, have had days and even whole weekends where I didn't escape into reading.  I now have a desire to finish things I've started and not go along with the novelty of something new - just to the point of buying the supplies, but not actually doing anything with them.  I previously could never *make* myself do housework etc. except for Saturday or Sunday mornings, now I do a bit every day and don't resent it and don't feel overwhelmed by it.  <br><br>I should mention that since starting AF, I have been working one full time job as well as putting in about 15 hours a week on a consulting contract - and a 1.75 hour daily commute.  Prior to this, I only had one job, where I occasionally worked overtime, but not on a regular basis.</div>

<div class="content">Gad, in comparison to that I blush ;-)<br><br>I have not done anything particularly different, I have just done more.  There were a number of areas in which things kind of "drifted" ... getting done, but not necessarily on a timely schedule.  That is more under control now as I am continually reminded and catch things before they get out of control.<br><br>I have a better understanding of what is on my plate and manage it better.  IOW, I had not realized how many things I was trying to do and so felt disappointed when things did not get done.  Now I see how much there is and understand that there is just too much on my list and am able to logically decide things to eliminate.  (In this regard I guess I have one step added to my system ... sometimes when I go through a page I just cross off (dismiss) something even though it does not need to be dismissed by the rule.  I just realize that I am NOT going to do it so I don't let it hang around a minute longer.  (Decisions are our friends! ;-)<br><br>Finally, my overall productivity has improved.  I had planned to keep metrics on AF and here is where I anticipated using them, but I decided to trash that Idea some time ago.  I realized that the metrics would not help me in any way and I did not like the overhead and the complexity it added to the basic simplicity of the system.  I had started adding start and end dates and all of that.  I gave it up along with my beloved tags ;-)<br><br>To summarize, AF has provided me with two things: increased productivity and better understanding and control.</div>

<div class="content">I'll play! Been doing Autofocus since Feb 1 after many years of GTD. Here's what I like about AF--<br><br>Much less set up time, no more breaking down each item to it's "next action" and no more determining if it is a next action, someday/maybe, etc. No more contexts for me either. I use to spend about an hour a day on "processing" alone-- now practically zero.<br><br>No more weekly review. Going through my open pages once a day or so and keeping a separate project and goal list obviates my need for a weekly review (something I had a hard time doing anyway).<br><br>Difficult tasks get done quicker. Do a little, cross it off, write it at the end. It works!<br><br>Simple tasks get done quicker. I used to fill guilty doing "simple" tasks when the more complex (and usually more important ones) did not get done. I would sometimes fall into a state of overwhelm where its relief was procrastination. Now I just move to a task that does not show resistance.<br><br>And lastly-- I like paper. Who would have thunk? I am a messy guy with horrible handwriting, who bough a Palm III when it first came out intending never to have to write reminders and such on paper again. But I love it. I use a standard spiral notebook, have no method towards what pens I use and write as messy as I want. It's liberating! Plus I feel a bit like a mad scientist when I look at my notebook from afar. I think my next notebook will be a hardbound lab book to complete the mad scientist motif.</div>

<div class="content">I have not yet made it through one pass of my list (I started in the beta phase) as my list grows by more tasks each day than I complete. However, I am currently on maternity leave so the majority of my day is spent looking after my daughter and it is isn't practical to include nappy changes and feeds into my list.<br><br>What I've found is when I have some time I can pick up the list and start on something and it doesn't matter if I have to stop because its just added again. Although my task completion is random depending on the current page it does mean I manage to complete things as well as baby tasks. Today I've tidied the house, researched into some software, did some work clearing up my computer by deleting emails, old software, temporary files and internet cache. Oh yes and catching up on the forum here is a task as well.</div>

<div class="content">I have not achieved any task in particular that I wouldn't have without AF. This is because I have been taking courses, so the majority of my important tasks have hard deadlines and not completing them is not really an option :-) However, I feel I have achieved some mental breakthroughs:<br><br>1) Not all tasks need to be done. (Unfortunately this doesn't apply to coursework ;-)<br>2) I do not need to plan every detail of my day in order to be productive.<br>3) In fact, planning (and many other "organizational" tasks) is often not worth the time I put in. Even my filing system has simplified. <br>4) I have limited time and energy during the day. I accept this, and work with it. This has given me an incredible sense of inner calm compared to the stress and frustration I used to feel.<br><br>More often than not over the last few months I have not had much discretionary time (or energy...) for AF due to a huge number of urgent tasks - assignments, presentations, meeting preparations. And yet I find myself applying the AF philosophy everywhere now. Project due tomorrow? I look at my project list and use AF to get through it. Need to clean my place before guests come? Create a mental to do list and AF my way through it. You could say I am just planning on the fly but it is deceptively organized and efficient compared to what I used to do (plan, then re-plan, then re-plan again, then panic). And it feels organic, natural. Perhaps I am a hippie at heart...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>You aught to frame your post!  It's truly inspiring!  It actually choked me up...... KUDOS TO YOU!!!!  EXCELLENT WORK!!!!!  I'm ashamed to admit that I couldn't make autofocus work for me except for tasks that don't fit it my usual system.  I AM TRULY AMAZED with what you accomplished both with your home and your personal endeavors!  Thanks for sharing your beautiful story.  I'm SURE Mark is QUITE PLEASED with how you worked his autofocus in such a STELLAR manner!<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Almond, that's exactly it!  You're at peace because you're doing what you *can* - and now you know the limits of what you can do and still have a happy, moderately balanced life.  <br>I've always been quite hard on myself vis-a-vis expectations, but in using AF, I'm realizing that I'm not procrastinating per se, I just am all too human and need a break once in awhile.  Before, I never felt I deserved a break at home because I KNEW I was procrastinating on stuff that was important.  So, yes, I did relax, etc., but it never felt right because there was always this amorphous cloud hanging over my time at home.  Of course I wanted to be at work all the time because that was the only time I felt good about myself.<br>Whew!  <br>Just want to say thanks, learning as I go - for contributing to my clean(er) :-) house - I camp a lot so the term "leave no footprint" really resonated for me.  (((hugs)))<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>I love my life best when I'm outdoors in any capacity!  I miss camping sorely.....please enjoy it twice as much for me!  I think part of the reason we detest some of our house chores is because they are more boring inside.  Washing your dishes in a basin filled with creek water is much more fun than loading a dishwasher....and outdoorswe don't have to chase crumbs.  We're feeding critters!  LOL!  And cleaning the campsite is a reverent ritual whereas running the vac can be a boring nuisance!.......There's something magical about taking care of our home when it's thousands of acres of God's country!  LOL!  <br>Rereading your post just chokes me up!  Your spiritual revelations are truly inspiring.  <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Using AF has pushed me to give myself things now that will make my life easier by identifying things that I found particularly time consuming or that I resisted doing and pushed me into resolving the issues rather than just pushing past my resistance.<br><br>For example, I had a recurring task to do the dishes on my list as my dishwasher has been broken for the last year or so.  I was going to put in all new appliances prior to selling the house, and wanted them to be brand new just prior to the sale.  Yet, I would put off doing the dishes until they piled up to where it was a big job.  I realized that spending the money now to make this task less onerous for me and less time consuming was a good investment, not a waste of money.  I installed new toilets for the same reason - it was impossible to keep the old ones clean.  <br><br>I also bought a new bike as mine had been broken for about 3 years and I was using my oldest son's bike which was far too big for me.  But I realized I wanted to spend quality time with my youngest son out biking and running the dog (spending "fun time" with my son is on my list and he loves to bike).  So today, I bought a beach cruiser!<br><br>I've also purchased a new battery for my robotic vacuum!<br><br></div>
