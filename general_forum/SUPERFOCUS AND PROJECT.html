<div class="content">I feel very well with superfocus V3 . My task are perfectly managed and realised. But I still have some difficulties about my projects. I need to see at a glance the purpous of my projects and the way I gona do them. <br><br>So I created a new master piece in my organization ie taking a new note book and  I put all my projects in the way i do with superfocus tasks. <br><br>The result is amazing. It is very easy to manage and easy to make them advance. I dont put any tasks in this project list but the aim I have and the way I will do it. Professionals projects are on the front and the personal projects start on the back.<br><br>All this dont take much time and is very easy. And it's less messy than letting them in superfocus. I just write on my SF task book read project on notebook and it's ok.</div>

<div class="content">Let me see if I understand you.  Instead of the normal SF page:<br>Task 1<br>Task 2<br>Task 3<br><br>You have this instead:<br>Project 1 Goal- How<br>Project 2 Goal - How<br>Project 3 Goal - How<br><br>and follow SF rules for picking projects and working on projects.<br>Back in the task book you will have<br>Task 1<br>Task 2<br>Read project book<br>Task 4<br><br><br>How many project entries do you have?</div>

<div class="content">Yes Alan that's right. <br>The purpous of the project notebook is to have a guidline about my projects because when I just reported in my task book it was very difficult to look at them at a glance. <br><br>I dont know yet if this will work it is just a try <br><br>I have about 20 professionnal projects and 10 personnal</div>

<div class="content">My apologies; I don't quite understand and I'm very curious as project organization is something that I would like to incorporate into my use of Superfocus. <br><br>Jupiter, do you mind giving me a few examples of how this works? What is the "how" that you write for each project? Thank you in advance!</div>

<div class="content">For awhile I did something similar with AF. I cycled through the list of my projects, not tasks,  As I came to each project, I worked on it until I felt I was ready to move on.  I trusted my mind to tell me when I got to a project what the most important task to move the project forward as and for how long to do it.  It actually worked pretty well.  Is this the type of approach you are using?</div>

<div class="content">@caitirilt The system is indeed simple here is an example<br>Buiding X get all what i can get about the buiding (taxes, pictures, plans and so on). See on my data base how could be interested by the building and may offer much money)<br><br>the process is to treat each project as an SF task<br><br>@Gerry<br>Yes. The point is that it is very easy for following project. But un easy when I work on my SF task book. So I began for some major project to include them directly in my SF task book as an underlined project and it is much better. I can so easily re formulate the project little by little and it's very easy. I also add some tasks just as think about or examine this things to force me to do things.</div>

<div class="content">Dear Jupiter,<br><br>Thanks for your reply! So for building x "getting all you can about the building (taxes, pictures, plans and so on)" is the ultimate goal of the project (as opposed to the next action, as it might be in GTD)?</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, <br><br>This is what I do in my SF3 alternative system. My task management notebook has entries that are either tasks or the names of projects. The tasks associated with the project are together on another sheet of paper.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">@ caitirilt<br>YES - IT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL. <br>About GTD, I use to like the system and at the beginning of it as i am a business maker i even thought i could make it teach in France. But little by little I quit something. It began with the context, then the next action, then omnifocus and all digital ways and finally i discovered AF1, then AF4 and THEN at last SFV3 which is my favorite system. <br><br>@2Mc<br>"This is what I do in my SF3 alternative system. My task management notebook has entries that are either tasks or the names of projects. The tasks associated with the project are together on another sheet of paper".<br><br>I have tried many things - doing a special project list apart from SF, including the project's name itself in my SFV3 list and finally it's the last option which works better for me.<br>I stil have some projects apart which can be in paper folders, in digital folders and files or even on paper files. They may include tasks but i realized for most of my project it was better to have a real paper folder and sole sheets of paper in the dossier including tasks or relative documents. I keep SF for what I really work on. And when there is something which is between such as something i want to do but i don't really know when i just pu it on a someday may be list which is on my paper notebook.</div>
