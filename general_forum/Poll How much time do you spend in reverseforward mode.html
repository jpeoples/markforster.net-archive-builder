<div class="content">Hi all<br>Although I'm not an AF'er, I'd think that the inexorable line of doom forces attention to those affected items that are actually culled  Forward Mode tasks. Therefore, even staying in Reverse mode would force some tasks from the beginning of the list to be addressed, yes?<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Unless things change when my job becomes less hectic, I am starting to think that all-reverse is better than RAF. Here's my thinking:<br><br>Right now, the only time I use forward mode is when I realize it's getting too close to the end of the day and I still haven't worked on the item(s) marked for dismissal. So I change to forward mode to work on that which is so marked. Once they are addressed, I quickly revert to reverse mode. Since that is the only time I use forward mode, I would be better off getting to the marked-for-dismissal item(s) by sticking to reverse mode, because it forces me to go though every page before I reach the marked-for-dismissal page. If anything, I am more likely to get some of the middle pages worked on by staying in pure reverse mode, than I would if I were to do RAF.</div>

<div class="content">I couldn't switch to Forward Mode not even a single time :-(<br><br>I switched to Review Mode a few times, but mostly I'm in Reverse Mode. My urgent, newest stuff takes most of my time, which doesn't surprise me at all.<br><br>When I put some tasks for review (most of the candidates, sadly), I realize that even if they are important, they have less priority, so I'm relatively fine with it.<br><br>The worst part is when the "Switch to FM" and "Switch to RM" tasks are about to get dismissed!! <br><br>It happened a few times already. What should I do in those cases? I cross them off and re-enter them at the end.<br><br>I'm even thinking about scheduling a weekly session for Review Mode.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I think this discussion is confirming what I was already finding through my own experience - that Revised Autofocus doesn't work as well as I hoped it would.<br><br>However I still think that a combination of an open list for more immediate tasks and a closed list to mop up the ones missed by the open list is very powerful. So I have now developed a new method which retains this combination but provides a balanced emphasis on both. So far for me it is working incredibly well, and one of the things that has really impressed me is how it continues to remain balanced even when I am pressed for time.<br><br>I also intend that it should retain a dismissal/review process, but I haven't yet finalised how that will work. I've got an idea which might make it much more powerful - but haven't yet had the chance to test it out.</div>

<div class="content">After just 4 days of RAF (after using AF1 since day1), I'm finding something similar: only moving to forward mode to make sure the items earmarked for review get addressed. For me, this illustrates that the urgent always gets the upper hand, given half the chance. One of the beauties of the original AF (or AF1) is that it forces you to go through and actually work on non-urgent items in order to get to the urgent ones, thereby making things move forward that in most other situations get sidetracked.<br><br>So I'm going to give RAF still a chance for a week or 2, and if the situation doesn't improve, I'll go back to the original AF -- unless the Revised RAF (RRAF?) provides a better way.</div>

<div class="content">I'm very curious about your new method Mark, but wanted to say that I like RAF quite a bit. Like others I don't spend much time in Forward mode compared to reverse, but I think that is how it should be. Most of my work is urgent and important, many of the tasks I get that day need to be done that day and Reverse handles this well.<br><br>I try to hit Forward mode once a day, usually for a half hour maximum. It is my favorite part of the day though, and this way I always get at least some important things done that at what feels to be a more leisurely pace.</div>

<div class="content">I think the main problem I have been finding with Revised AF is that the middle of the list tends to stagnate. Neither Forward nor Reverse mode seems to be able to keep it moving.  So by the time something gets within the normal range of Forward Mode it may have been hanging around on the list for a long time. There's nothing necessarily wrong with some stuff being on the list for a long time, but it needs to be the right stuff and not just everything which hasn't been processed by Reverse Mode.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I have had a similar experience with RAF. I never get very far back into the list in Reverse Mode, and don't get far forward in Forward Mode, so the stuff in between gets old. However, I don't think this is a problem -- it would have got done when it was first put on the list if it was urgent, and will be done or dismissed eventually.<br><br>I probably spend about 75% of my time in Reverse, and 25% in Forward mode. Time for Review Mode is negligible -- perhaps 5 minutes a week.<br><br>Forward Mode is great -- I do my most worthwhile work in Forward Mode. AF1 was good for this, too, but at the expense of urgent stuff being missed. RAF works well for me at the moment, and I'm looking forward to finding out how it can be bettered.</div>

<div class="content">I'm finding my time dominated by Reverse Mode.  I thought it was because I've been dealing with a lot of urgent tasks lately, and doing a lot of overtime.  But now I think, like others have said, that the "tyranny of the urgent" just takes over and prevents "Forward Mode" from feeling ready to be done.<br><br>And when I do switch to Forward Mode, I usually stay there a VERY short time -- looking at just one or two pages, before nothing feels ready to be done and I switch back to Reverse.  <br><br>If I do happen to stay in Forward Mode longer, like I did yesterday, it's usually because I come to those neglected middle pages.  Half the items on those pages aren't even applicable any more, because they got re-entered later during the regular course of things, and got dealt with in Reverse Mode.  So I mark them all as completed and look for anything interesting that's left on the page.  Might find one or two things, take a small action, and then add the item to the end.  <br><br>Yesterday I spent about an hour or two doing that, going through about 50 pages in the neglected middle, till I finally found a page that didn't have anything ready to be done.  It felt a bit like AF1, but somehow I didn't really get anything important done.<br><br>Here is what really stood out for me.  It seems that Forward Mode is designed to be where you spend most of your time, after all your urgent stuff has been dealt with in Reverse Mode and you feel enough on top of your urgent tasks that it's OK to switch to Forward.  Forward Mode is really supposed to help you work on the "important" tasks-- some of which are big projects that are hard to break down into manageable chunks.  <br><br>AF1 dealt with these things really well, especially when using the "little and often" approach.  But Forward Mode doesn't seem to have the same effect.  I really don't feel patient enough to settle in and work in Forward Mode long enough to do any effective or meaningful work on the important stuff.  I keep itching to get back to Reverse Mode -- the siren call of urgency keeps beckoning.  And eventually I heed its call, before I've been in Forward Mode long enough to really get into the swing of things.<br><br>Also, I really do miss the AF1 dismissal process.  It just seemed really intuitive and effective.  Instead of dismissing, Forward Mode just sends you back to Reverse Mode when nothing feels ready to be done.  At first I liked this, and felt it made sense, because sometimes it seemed nothing felt ready to be done in Forward Mode, because I was getting nervous about urgent things and needed to go take a look at them.  But now, nothing stands out and I switch back to Reverse Mode, just because I like the adrenaline rush of always working on what's urgent.  <br><br>I HAVE been working pretty effectively in RAF.  But I think that's because, lately, I'm doing so much overtime and MUST focus on the urgent things.  Now that some of that urgency is going away, I am feeling nervous, and feeling a bit uneasy that maybe I've been letting other important things go too long without the attention they deserve.  <br><br>It's made me take a serious look at the TRO training and software that has been discussed on a different thread.  I'm holding off on that, since I really don't want to abandon a paper-based approach and always be tied to my computer, and also since I am looking forward to whatever Mark's got percolating for us...  But yes, I am also feeling that my middle pages are getting neglected, and more importantly, the AF1 ability to focus on what's really important doesn't really seem to be working for me in RAF.</div>

<div class="content">One more thing -- yesterday I got into a good groove, getting lots done on several different fronts.  I was working in Reverse Mode, and I was using a timer to make sure I didn't spend too much time on any one task.  <br><br>I had half a dozen urgent things I needed to work on, and I knew they were scattered across my most recent 3-4 pages.  I'd set the timer maybe for 10 minutes, maybe 15 minutes, maybe 30 or 40 minutes, for any one task, whatever felt appropriate at the time. <br><br>I kept finding that I needed to force myself to ignore my most recent page, and keep scanning back a few pages, to make sure I dug out all those items.  Eventually I got them all on my most current page.  <br><br>But that didn't last long, as I quickly started a new page, and after a couple hours, yet another new page.  The tasks on which I needed to focus were again scattered across the last several pages.   And I couldn't just focus on the last page.  It certainly had urgent things that needed attention, but I also knew there were a few other tasks that kept falling to the 2nd and 3rd most recent pages, and I needed to make sure I kept moving them forward as well.   <br><br>Reverse Mode made this somewhat difficult.  I kept wanting to go back to the tasks I had just recently worked on, the ones that were still right in front of me on the last page.  But this wasn't working, and was leaving those other tasks neglected.  I had to keep going hunting for them.  I was really getting a lot done, and moving forward on all this work, but there were just too many to keep in my head at the same time, and I couldn't remember what was already completed and what wasn't.  <br><br>I found myself wishing for AF1 to deal with this.  You work the current page.  If your timer runs out but your task isn't done yet, it gets moved to the last page.  Out of sight for a bit.  Which is nice, because it forces you then to work on something else for a while, till you come to that last page.<br><br>I almost started up a temporary AF1 list just to deal with this particular day's work.  But before I did that, I actually got to the end of this pile of work, and finished off nearly all those tasks, so it became a moot point.<br><br>But again, my key observation from this is that I really miss the AF1 approach.  I really liked the rhythm and balance it provided, the focus on what's really important.  It certainly did have issues with handling truly urgent tasks, and I'm NOT saying that I'm going to go back to AF1.  <br><br>But RAF doesn't actually seem to provide that auto-focus character any more.  It's still effective for getting lots of work done.  But I don't have the confidence that I had with AF1, that the IMPORTANT stuff is getting done "automatically", while the rest is dismissed "automatically".</div>

<div class="content">Here's my visceral assessment. It's more fun to work in reverse. There is less frustration. But, rationally, I know that my long-term good is aided more by working forward. Moment-by-moment, however, I choose my short-term fun over my long-term good. <br><br>Most of my items marked for dismissal are singletons. I am thinking of marking PAGES for dismissal. That might force me to spend more time sorting through dead wood. It won't address the neglect of the middle, but it would help me get rid of the very stale stuff at a more rapid rate.<br><br>If I were Mark, I would just do it for a few weeks and report my results. But, before I try it, I thought I might do some crowdsourcing. Usually someone can uncover some clever tweak that totally escaped me.</div>

<div class="content">Something I posted a couple of months ago which might be of help:<br><br>'You could try treating your AF2 dismissed items as an AF1 list, following AF1 rules.<br><br>So there would be an AF2 section at the end of the list for day-to-day, and and AF1 section above that for longer term.<br><br>If an AF1 item is worked on it would then be added to the bottom of the list in the AF2 section.

<div class="content">Walter wrote: "Maybe the switching should be based on some stricter rule (not when I feel like it)." I agree, in principle, although all of these systems (FC, GTD, AF, AF2, RAF, etc.) are really about us playing motivational games with ourselves. I'll admit that I haven't switched to Forward Mode for a few days now, although I've scanned past the "switch" reminder several times.<br><br>Perhaps just a clarification in the instructions is in order, e.g. "Forward Mode should feel ready to be entered at least once per day; Review Mode should be entered at least once per week." Since we put a date at the first entry each day, it would be easy to stop briefly and consider whether it's time to switch modes, not just if we "feel" like switching.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br><< Have you considered releasing your latest modification as a Beta and letting the very dedicated people here take it through the paces? >><br><br>Well, this is essentially what I have been doing with the previous releases. But one does have to have something to offer at the Beta stage, and I do have to assess minimum functionality (which is pretty high if it is to be better than the previous AFs). In particular I need to test the dismissal process, which is difficult at present because I haven't yet dismissed anything!</div>

I never spend more than 40 minutes on a single task before moving on. Most items are 5 minutes to 10 minutes duration. Perhaps I am using a more fine-grained resolution for my list. Or it may be that most of my work is delegating things to teams and then following-up on progress. I also have a very limited span of uninterrupted time - calls, meetings, colleagues - all have the effect of making short bursts of effort my normal way of working.<br><br>I think I have a fourth mode as well - I call it 'Gathering Mode'. I spend time attending meetings where I gather tasks and I also spend a lot of 'think time' where I mind-map what needs to happen and gather tasks from that process. But I have not measured it yet.

<div class="content">Hi Cruisader,<br><br>Good thread. When I started RAF I'd say I spent 99% of my time in reverse mode, 1% in Forward and none in Review.<br><br>Since then I've liberally scattered "Switch to ... mode" for forward and Review, adding one of each every couple of pages. This has helped me a great deal and RAF is now working very well for me. Percentage-wise I'd say it is now 60% Reverse, 35% Forward and 5% Review.<br><br>Standard approach is Reverse which hits all of the activites added over the past 3-5 days. Moving to Forward mode knocks out tasks from prior to that. Spending time in that mode feels different and I try to stay there as long as possible, and also add a new Switch task to the end of the list when I finish so that I can easily go back in to Forward (once I've done a little Reverse to clear anything urgent/due) and continue on a roll. I like this over AF1 in that then I was missing deadlines - RAF enables me to do both.<br><br>Review mode is occasional for me. "The creeping line of death" (early tasks which get marked for Review) is slow, steady but powerful. A lot of tasks go into it over time, and a few get done. When it feels right to revisit them, which tends to be when there's a few moments peace or when travelling, most stay where they are In Review, and a few make the leap to new tasks (reworded, and with a feel that they wll get done this time).<br><br>It feels like AF1 was a faster yet "scarier" ride, moving the start of the open list much faster than RAF does. I would consider putting a whole page into Review in the future, rather than just the fist block of contiguous tasks (as these are often now only 1-3 items). I prefer Review to Dismiss as a term too, enabling not-yet items to stay put, on review, out of mind but not out of sight.<br><br>Regards<br>Jonathan<br><br></div>

When I wrote the comment "all of these systems are really about us playing motivational games with ourselves," I believe I misspoke. What I should've said was that the way in which we use them effectively involves self-motivational tricks, hacks, strokes, or games.  And I don't mean it disparagingly! One of the best tricks in AF, in my opinion, is your suggestion to make a dot beside the item that stands out. If one uses a pen, you can't erase the dot, so it's a very strong motivator to at least do *something* on that task before moving on.</div>

<div class="content">Cruisader, I don't really follow RAF I'm afraid, so I can't comment on my time split with it.  And I don't use any variation of AF for my full time job.<br><br>I still use a lot of common sense "do this now" for quick responses to emails, I just don't write it down - I think I spend maybe an hour a day doing that.  I pretty much only put larger projects on my list that I can't do right when I get them.  In the morning before I leave for work, I do about 1/2-2 hours of tasks and just randomly pick whatever stands out on the list, then another 2-3 hours of forward mode in the evening, always starting at the first page, not where I left off.   Lots of times that's only 1-2 tasks though.  It seems to help with keeping the list short.  I don't spend every waking moment with the book like some do, for me it's pretty much a work tool.  If I intuitively feel I need a break, I'm pretty capable of intuitively picking a book off my bookshelf or intuitively picking a movie without consulting a list, I don't ever want to be that anal.  <br><br>Re. review mode:  Since I clarified what I was saying "yes" to vs. just putting everything on the list about a month ago, I've only dismissed 1 item after doing a purge of about 130 items.   I have no intention of doing a review because most of what I dismissed in the purges will come up again if it's important.   I look at it like decluttering.  Most people find when they move, they pull out everything they use, then there's a bunch of boxes left in the garage or basement full of junk that they never look at.  It seems pointless to me to go through those boxes periodically looking for things to complicate your life with.  <br><br>Re. other stats:  I only have 6 active pages, one page with 7 open items.  I estimate I add only about 5-7 items/day.  Ideally, I'd like to keep that number steady, just add as many items as I complete in a day.  In total, I have an estimated 83 hours of work and 76 items on my list.  There's ~23 hours of "C" (no large impact on my life/goals) items, and 60 hours of "A" (will move me towards my main goals + family) tasks or peace of mind (like getting a driver's license renewed).  I had thought I had about a week's worth of work to do on my list, but it appears it's more like 2 weeks.  Darn...<br><br></div>
