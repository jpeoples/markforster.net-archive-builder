<div class="content">Zane<br><br>The threads are displayed in order of the most recent comment. So all you have to do is to start with the first thread and work back until you hit a thread in which you have already read the last comment.</div>

<div class="content">I have a method for keeping track of the thread posts (using OneNote but I think you could do the same with Word & PrintScreen)<br><br>I have a blank page in OneNote and use the Screen Clip utility to extract a screenprint of the thread list once I have read all of the threads.  The next time I access the forum I can then easily see the last few threads that I had read and only need to look at posts above that point.  Once I have read up to date again, I go back to my OneNote page, hit the undo button to remove the last screenclip, and then reclip the "new" position.  It takes a matter of seconds to do and makes it a LOT easier ...... <br></div>
