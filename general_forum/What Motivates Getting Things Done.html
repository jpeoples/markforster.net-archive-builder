<div class="content">I’ve recently started reading “What Motivates Getting Things Done” by Dr Mary Lamia. It’s early beginnings, but I think her overall thesis is correct: we are all programmed, from an early age, to use anxiety to get things done in different ways. My hunch is that, there are deep underpinnings that would draw someone to Mark’s more popular list/rule based systems vs Cal Newport’s Time Blocking system vs other advice to just “go with the flow”. <br><br>Here’s a quote from her book, describing the forces beneath our consciousness that leads one to make a to-do list (or not), and proceed to tackle the items on said list (or not):<br><br>“Each day as she enters the office, Judith becomes anxious. Keep in mind that the actual basis of Judith’s anxiety is unknown. The thoughts that arise with the sensations she feels provide an assumed source for her that justifies why she is anxious. For Judith, the thoughts that account for her anxiety have to do with what she needs to get done each day. So the first thing she does is list her pending work-related tasks on a pad of paper […] People with different task-completion styles who live together seem to have a particularly hard time when a situation or circumstance reveals their differences and they do not understand the emotions that motivate each other’s behavior.”<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B073T6HNYT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B073T6HNYT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o00?ie=UTF8&psc=1</a></div>

<div class="content">I wouldn't call that anxiety. I would call that sense of responsibility. The awareness that you as a grown up have duties. That you have to take care of them every day, before you have time to play.<br><br>And yes, we have an upbringing and those adults that took care of us, had their specific ways to induce said sense of responsibility into us.<br><br>Don't know what Lamia's point is, hopefully more than the realization that at some point you are supposed to stand on your own feet.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< People with different task-completion styles who live together seem to have a particularly hard time when a situation or circumstance reveals their differences and they do not understand the emotions that motivate each other’s behavior. >><br><br>Does this mean that Judith is an example of one particular "task-completion" style, and that other people may have quite different motivations?</div>

<div class="content"><<I wouldn't call that anxiety.>><br><br>I guess it depends on how you define anxiety. I would say that anxiety was behind my decision to write my books, the process of writing, etc, etc. My decision to become a family therapist was also related to anxiety, as was my decision to get married and have kids. <br><br>One of her main points is that there are mature (responsible) ways to work with your anxiety, and immature (irresponsible) ways. <br><br>Anyway, I think the book touches on important themes not addressed in most productivity books.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum<br><br>Thanks for flagging this book up. I'm a few chapters in and it's extremely interesting. As an "effective procrastinator" it's already given me quite a few personal insights.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< One of her main points is that there are mature (responsible) ways to work with your anxiety, and immature (irresponsible) ways. >><br><br>Without having read the book, I would say that overall there are two main ways of dealing with anxiety:<br><br>1. Ways which decrease the anxiety.<br>2. Ways which increase the anxiety.<br><br>Whether those necessarily equate to mature vs. immature or responsible vs. irresponsible, I don't know but I suspect it's pretty close.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><< I would say that overall there are two main ways of dealing with anxiety:<br><br>1. Ways which decrease the anxiety.<br>2. Ways which increase the anxiety.>><br><br>I would agree with you. Though I think it's important to mention that I work from a different theoretical orientation (Family Systems Theory) than Dr. Lamia.<br><br>She does mention that procrastinators, and non procrastinators, both have their anxiety reduced based on their preferred means of getting things done.</div>

<div class="content">It seems to me that ways to increase anxiety are those that ignore or avoid the issue.  Ways to decrease all involve addressing the source of anxiety.  This could be by leaving the situation or by fixing the problem or by other means, but it tends to be deliberate.</div>

<div class="content">As for me, I get a remarkable satisfaction eliminating points in my to-do list one by one :)</div>
