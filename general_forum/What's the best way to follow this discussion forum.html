<div class="content">Maybe some of you have figured out a good way to follow along in this forum.  I've been doing a round about work around of opening the posts that are updated that day, then scrolling down to the point where it is new/or new to me.<br><br>But this seems inefficient.<br><br>...and makes it hard for me to get to my closed list!! :)<br><br>Lena<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Lena<br><br>I don't have an answer for you on this at the moment, but I am contacting the Squarespace staff to see if there is any way that you can subscribe to new posts - rather like an RSS feed. <br><br>I'll let you know the answer.</div>

<div class="content">Unfortunately the reply is that this feature is currently unavailable, but they have noted my request for possible future action.<br><br>However most days the new posts relate to only one or two topics, so hopefully it isn't too big a problem. (For those who haven't noticed, the topics are arranged in order of the latest update, not in order of the first posting, so it's easy to see where the new stuff is).<br><br>One final suggestion, Lena. Put "Check MF's Discussion Forum" on your closed list - then you won't have to feel guilty about not getting to it!</div>
