<div class="content">There are these portions of the day, when your mind starts to wander…<br><br>… during the commute, when you are humming along the radio tune that you became to hate because they play it too often… …or when taking a shower… …or when cooking…<br><br>… and so on.<br><br>I noticed that my mind changed here. <br><br>I guess because of years long training via Tony Robbins RPM method, Covey's Weekly Compass and Roles, and GTD's Areas of Focus, my mind would start to wander through each of these "Level 2" items. <br><br>While observing myself I could see how my mind had internalized that level and talked itself trough the list…<br><br>Lately I noticed a change. My mind now autofocuses on the items on my AF list (I use Simple Scanning) which are stuck at the beginning of the list. <br><br>My mind uses it's "wandering time" now to sort that part of the list out.</div>
