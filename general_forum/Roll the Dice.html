<div class="content">Sometimes it's easy to decide what to do next. Something's urgent, or the first on the list looks good, or something calls to me, or I feel that something's been missing in my life.<br><br>Other times....<br><br>I make a list of what I want to do in the next few days. I try to put more important ones on top, but it's not strictly necessary. It's rarely more than 20, often under 10.<br><br>Then I roll a die. (Actually, I look at a clock that shows seconds and subtract 20 until I get something between 1 and 20.)<br><br>There's a reason I don't role one die 3 times. Rolling a 6-sided die 3 times gives no 1 or 2, very few 3, but many of 13's.<br><br>I count down unactioned items. When I reach the end of the list, I go back to the top. Tasks on the top are more likely to get action, which is why more important ones go to the top.<br><br>Something about rolling the die takes the decision out of my hands and breaks the analysis-paralysis. Some days I think Someone is guiding the die for me. Other times it's an excuse to work on something I enjoy when I think I should work on something else instead (in which case I usually end up doing nothing).<br><br>I'll often use "first on list" at the start of the day, then roll the die for a few choices, then do the stuff that really should be done before the kids get home.</div>

<div class="content">I do that sometimes too. If I'm using a list online, it's usually in Excel, so I set up a formula to give a random number between 1 and whatever number the last task. The clock idea is interesting too</div>

<div class="content">I would often use a dice (or even multiple tosses of a coin to binary-chop) through my today tasks when using DIT. I saw it as an extreme way of convincing myself that if my only criterion was to get through today's stuff and sequence was irrelevant, then I could surrender all control of sequence.</div>

<div class="content">I remember ads for that movie.<br><br>The difference is, I take full responsibility for loading the list in the first place.<br><br>It's like driving drunk. You choose to drink. You choose to drive drunk. You choose to drastically increase the risk to yourself and others. It's not the beer's fault.<br><br>John, I think you're right. It does force me to think more carefully about "if I let the die make all the decisions, based on this list..." If the list is bad, garbage in = garbage out.<br><br>Further refinement:<br><br>A block of low-priority tasks has appeared. I lump them into one item. If that item is chosen, I roll again to choose between. Depending on the day, I might then remove the rest of that block from the list.<br><br>Some tasks are higher priority, so I mark them in the margin and count them twice. That way I have twice as much chance of doing them. This is both urgent tasks (that I don't want to promote to "just do") and undated tasks that keep getting put off.</div>
