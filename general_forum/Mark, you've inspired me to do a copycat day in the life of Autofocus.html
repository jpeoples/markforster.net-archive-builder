<div class="content">OK, my list might be a lot less fun to do, but here goes:<br><br><a href="http://8020time.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://8020time.blogspot.com/</a><br><br>Hopefully one day when I read instructions from the new and improved version that I understand, I can try it out as well and compare the two.<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>You go girl!  ;-) ;-)<br><br>What's not to understand?<br><br>- One long list<br>- A line demarking a "closed sub list"<br>- Loop through the closed list until you can't do more<br>- Do one pass through the open list portion<br>- Go back and start looping through the closed list again<br>- Lather, rinse, repeat ;-0<br><br>When you make a pass of the closed list and don't do anything (like AF1 here)<br><br>- Draw a line at the end of the open list portion making it the new closed list<br>- Add any closed list items you want to save to the end of the NEW open list (after the line)<br>- Trash the OLD closed list<br><br>It should work fine with your prioritized goal oriented list as well.<br><br>The KEY points, as I see them are:<br><br>- It is ONE LONG LIST (with a "closed" and "open" section)<br>- - You process the first in a continual loop<br>- - You process the second in one single pass<br><br>- Switching is automatic<br>- - From closed to open when you find nothing to do<br>- - From open to closed at the end of one pass<br><br>- There is now only one dismissal rule<br>- - You dismiss ONLY from the closed list when nothing is done on a pass<br>- - You get to KEEP dismissed items if you choose<br><br>- You declare the open list "closed" when you invoke the dismissal rule<br><br>IMO, it is by far the simplest system yet.  No forward and backward.  No different dismissal rules.  No entering dummy reminder tasks to switch directions.  My cats could do this one.  (But alas, the only item on their list today is to sleep until dinner time ;-)<br><br>Give it a shot!   ;-)</div>

<div class="content">OK, giving it a shot - so I'm drawing a line after my whole list that I have now, right?  And that's my closed list?<br>Not sure if I'll get out of it today, but I'll give it a shot!</div>
<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-09-5 13:48</div>
<div class="content">Yup.  Your whole list is the closed list.  Now just circulate and add new below the line you just drew.  Go there only when you find nothing to do on the closed list.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-5 14:20</div>
<div class="content">One hour in, and I'm cheating already by going below the line because it makes sense to do it right then.  Grrr...</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>If you "jump" to an item on the Active List, then what you have done in effect is to say that there are no tasks in the Backlog that feel ready to be done just then. That is actually the signal in any case to move to the Active List.<br><br>The important thing now is to continue from the task you have just done. So if it was early in the Active List continue through the Active List. If it was the last item on the Active List, return to the first task in the Backlog.<br><br>So, as you can see, you didn't cheat at all!</div>

<div class="content">Oh thanks Mark!  There was some new items I wanted to do anyway.  Good to know this is working according to my brain patterns.  (That's a first!)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, Mark,<br><br>That is exactly what happened to me.  I felt like doing something on the open list and went there ... I figured that was fine.  I was also doing some chores around the house and stumbled on other things that I knew were later on the list so I just knocked them off.  The I had lunch (not on my list ;-) and now I'm going to scan the  list to see what I've done and cross them off.  I'll pickup from where I was at the last task.<br><br>So far so good.</div>

<div class="content">Just a question - I keep going off list addressing something current to do - I guess if I were doing this "right", I would write this stuff down, but it seems silly to write it down, then do it, and then cross it off?<br></div>
<h2>Reply by Nicole</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-09-5 22:19</div>
<div class="content">The reason I don't find it silly to write it down and then do it, is that before doing it I continue to go through the list until I reach the end where I just wrote down a new urgent item. That way, I'm sure there's nothing on the list that's become even more urgent than the thing I just wrote down.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>That idea is percolating with me now.  Back at the first of the year, I said I thought it was just stupid to write something down, cross it off, and write it back down again.  As it was silly to write down what had been done.<br><br>Watching Mark actually work his list has gotten me to rethinking all of that.  I would NEVER write "Lunch", on my list.  But I have a feeling that it serves a purpose that I've not yet understood.</div>

<div class="content">Looking at your log, I see that you may not be doing what I'm not doing and Mark is -- working intensively out of the AF list.<br><br>In watching Mark, he seems to just be driven BY the list.  Where as I go and work, then come back ot the list to catch up with where I am, see what is to be done, then go off for a couple of hours, perhaps.  I think this might have a lot to do with the way I see the list and how it works, or does not work for me.<br><br>This is food for thought for me.  I'm going to try looking at the list every time I switch focus tomorrow.  That is going to be tough, but it will be instructive.<br><br>Thanks for posting your time log.  It helped me identify that difference.<br><br>Oh, and I have now met someone who drinks ALMOST as much coffee as I do !  ROTFLMAO ;-)</div>

<div class="content">One way I've looked at writing down and crossing off what I've already done is sort of like DIT's "know what a day's worth of work looks like".  It's also good to remind one's self of what one has done when feeling that the day was a waste (or seeing that it really was - a quick reality check).</div>

The experiment was instructional for me too, as I realized I really hate working from a list all the time.  I never felt like I was really immersing myself in anything, losing track of time and all that good stuff that comes from being in the flow.  Maybe part of it was keeping the log, I'm not sure.<br><br>Tomorrow I will try to work as I do at my job where I don't use a list.<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>No, not a bad thing but a different thing.  I feel that I need to experiment with the way Mark does it and evaluate the effect on me.  As with all else, I suspect compromise might end up being the key.<br><br>As to your blog:  Fascinating.  I learned from that as well.  I have not done a real time log in years.  I can easily do that in conjunction with my experiment in sticking to the list.  I'm going to put a tick mark every twenty minutes and quantify where I spend my time over a whole day.  Today should be interesting.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Mike, I find time logs are really useful, just as money logs can be when you're trying to change spending patterns or calorie logs when you're trying to follow a diet. :-)   I used to do a time log at work every day for years.  I think it's a good exercise to do for about a week and see where the time goes.<br><br>I think this is how the book "The Paradox of Choice - Why More is Less" (which I read yesterday) relates to time management:  having more choice in what to do does not lead to happiness with our choices most of the time.  Having more options makes us question those choices we have made.  Of course, we don't THINK it will, we think we'll be happier with lots of choice - but the science proves us wrong.  <br><br>I think that's why AF1 was more of a "hit" than the other systems, because our choices were limited to whatever was on that single page in front of us.  I felt that it was MUCH harder for me to pick what to do under this system vs. AF1.  Whether you're a maximizer or a satisficer should probably be the criteria for which version of AF would suit a person most.<br><br>I felt kind of confused the whole day, just like I do when I go into a tile store and have hundreds of options to choose from.  I end up walking out because I feel any decision I will make is wrong.  But, as the book says, I am a maximizer (quite high unfortunately), not a satisficer.<br><br>Here's a couple of sites that give the gist of the book:<br><br><a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2006/06/are_you_a_satis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2006/06/are_you_a_satis.html</a><br><br><a href="http://betweenlivingandexisting.blogspot.com/2008/08/maximizer-versus-satisficer.html" rel="nofollow">http://betweenlivingandexisting.blogspot.com/2008/08/maximizer-versus-satisficer.html</a><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Excellent points.  I don't have time to read the links now, but I got that WONDERFUL add-in for FireFox (Read It Later)  I just had to right click the link and click Read It later from the context menu and Voila ... it is queued for me when I have the time to read it.  YeeeHaaa.  At last a really useful tool for us bibleovores ;-)<br><br>I have not experienced the problem you describe yet.  But then I'm running a major experiement today so I don't feel as if I'm making life changing choices ;-)  I'm just pretending I'm Mark for the day (but I'm having a hell of a time with the accent ;-)  I'm also pretending I'm Jacqueline and running a time log.  So far, that has had the effect of making me more accountable.  I think that will be good.<br><br>Didjasee Andreas' PDF?  WOW.  That really made it clear how the system works.  Neato!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike, yes, I looked at Andreas' PDF - awesome stuff when you go through all 400+ pages in about 2 minutes.  But I got a sick feeling in my stomach b/c that's not how I work best.  <br><br>Here's a link for my schedule for today.

<div class="content">It looks as though you are making good progress today.<br><br>I'm still slavishly following the rules in a new notebook and watching what the experience tells me.  So far, I've added quite a few tasks, either because more work needs to be done, or I thought of them as I went.  My chunk size is much smaller than usual for me.  There is something about the system which calls for smaller chunks.  I'm not sure if I like that or not, but I'll keep plugging.<br><br>One thing I hate about the larger book (for this experiment) is that I don't have it with me so when I'm off doing something and I see something else I can do, I still just do it rather than running to get the book to write it down and then waiting for its turn to come up.  This also bothers me.  The upside to the larger book is that when I leave it open it is easy to write things down quickly.  I like that.<br><br>I've also realized that I work better standing up.  I did not notice that I was usually doing that when using my pocket book.  But it is noticeable with the larger book. Our 2" plasma TV went kflooy last week.  It is in the shop and so the mantel over the fireplace is free and I'm able to keep my book there and stand to write in it.  Much nicer than jumping up and down from a chair.  I may revisit the idea of making myself a standing desk.  I've always wanted one and I know I have plans around here somewhere.<br><br>My time long is going well  I had forgotten exactly how to do one, its been so long.  Now I have the kinks worked out and every 10 min my watch beeps and I note what I'm doing and put a tick mark in the appropriate category.  I suppose if I do this for a few days I'll have the categories better sorted out and have a good picture of where my days go.<br><br>My (much too early) impression so far is that my day has been much more productive.  That is to say I've gotten more tasks done, and a few which have been hanging around for a long time.  I think that it is also true that most of them have been C tasks.  That may be an artifact of the way the system works.  It tends to have me writing down things that flit through my head (squirrel moments) and those are always Cs ... or WORSE!  I think I need my planning brain to balance this all out.  But that is for another day.  Today, I'm a slave to Mark's AF4, as written.  We shall see ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I'm a bit fried so I'm going to call it quits for today.  Beside, Fitzgerald is biting at me because he has decided he wants to be fed ... even though it is an hour early and there is still food in his dish!<br><br>Here are my stats for today:<br><br>  7 out of 29 tasks closed from the Closed List<br>17 out of 74 tasks closed from the Open List (starting number)<br>46 tasks added today<br>  0 tasks dismissed today <br><br>There are probably 2 or 3 more things I will do before quitting ... I just want to close the computer for the day and let my mind rest ;-)<br><br>My 10 minute time log shows that most of my day was on list or on the computer.  The two biggest time syncs for the computer were this forum and ordering things for my TV system (HDMI cables, etc.) and some misc. other things I'd put off.<br><br>I did not get to any of my outside tasks today.  I'll probably try to make that my focus for tomorrow.  That should give me some balance and let me knock off about 1/2 dozen tasks from the Closed list.  I really want to reduce those 22 tasks down to something manageable before I hit dismissal.  I'd like to dismiss no more than 6 or so and I'd like to get there tomorrow.  Doable ;-)<br><br>Hope your day went as well.  Looks as though it did.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mike!  Glad the experiment worked for you.  Holy smokes, I thought I had a tendency to dump, but I've never put 46 things down in one day!<br><br>It was a most excellent day full of nothing but A-list and the day just flew by.  Even better, I didn't add a single task.  I did discard one though. :-)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-7 1:04</div>
<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>I would not normally add that many tasks but I was doing the kind of thing Mark does ... I added some fairly small tasks but I had to do that so that I could "level set" the way Mark uses AF4.  Also, realize that with the "little and often" approach, a lot of tasks were partially done and then re-added.  For example a task to copy files to my iPod wound up being done in peices:<br><br>- Find iPod<br>- Find Charging Cable<br>- Charge iPod<br>- Copy Files<br><br>HA!  And I thought I could go straight to the last ;-)  So the single task I set was re-added several times in different ways.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-7 21:05</div>
<div class="content">Mark, I responded in my blog, so you don't have to go there (unless you want to see my pictures!) - here's my response:<br><br>"That implies that I was just messing around for the last 2 months, not doing much of anything, and not following Autofocus - which is SO not true. What Autofocus did help me to do was get to this state (which was a major accomplishment in itself), and get everything prepared to put this Humpty Dumpty back together again.  But I can't deny that if I didn't pre-dismiss when working the system, I often ended up doing a lot of junk tasks that I really could care less about.<br><br>As I am a "maximizer", I can be pretty indecisive if I'm not clear in what I want to "create".   I had tons of entries in my AF list like "buy taps for vanity", whoops, didn't fit "return taps for vanity", "buy taps for vanity" again; "go to Home Depot and look at tile", "go to Totem and look at tile", "go to Home Hardware and look at tile", "go back to Home Depot and get tile".  And basically repeat that cycle of indecisiveness and inaction over and over again with almost everything.  <br><br>Initially I wanted to contract this bathroom out to be done, but then my contractor didn't show up to do the estimate back in July. It was another couple of weeks before I found a picture of the exact bathroom to copy which is similar in layout to my bathroom. <br><br>Given that I am not a satisficer (as it appears most men are!), I have to learn to deliberately channel my "inner man" for projects like this - which shouldn't be that difficult since I do it at work, but I suspect it will take a lot of practice... :-)<br><br>I have also had an issue in the past with following through and finishing personal projects (not at work though, I have a compulsion for closure there). Where Autofocus has helped immeasurably with this in lighting a fire under my butt and getting me started. However - with a major home renovation like I am going through, I think it shows how important project management can be to get a job done on a timely basis and in the right order. I didn't use any project management techniques and I should have. My only reason for not doing that was that I used to plan, plan, plan and never do, do, do. That's not the plan's fault though, it's the user.  <br><br>I'm attaching pictures of some of the things I have done over the last couple of months just to show I haven't just been f-g (or walking) the dog.   That's the perfect tile for a small bathroom, and the beadboard, vanity and lighting is going to be just beautiful.  Aren't my floors pretty that we (almost) finished this month?  That's my bedroom furniture etc. in the middle of the room as it's cleared out, the first coat of paint is on and we're going to do those floors next weekend.  Now just to get those baseboards that don't fit in my car home - problem is the hardware store closes at 6 p.m. and I reach home at ~ 5:55 p.m.  Oh well, that'll be next weeks project."<br><br>Just my guess, but I would imagine that what I'm trying to do with a full-time job, consulting client, home renovations and being a single parent - not to mention the dog! :-)  makes David Drake look like a slacker.  (Not implying that David is!)<br><br>Add to that an inability to sleep more than 5 hours a night for months (which makes me less productive, not more, and less able to focus).<br><br>Sorry Mark, I didn't mean to imply that I was criticizing the system, and I apologize if you read it that way.  I just seem to feel more accomplishment - and contentment - when I immerse myself in a project and follow it through to the end fairly quickly.  In following AF (despite the "do it as long as you feel like"), I found myself always thinking I should always do little and often and keep moving through the list, and maybe that's not the best thing for someone who can be hyper-focused (and likes to be) like me?<br></div>

"<br><br>Here's the thing though - I speak from only about 8 years of experience with myself at work of going home every day feeling good about what I've got done - and I feel best with focusing on just a few things to do and blocking everything else out of my consciousness at the time.

I want to immerse myself in a project, lose track of time and finish the darn thing.  Then step back at the end of the day and say "wow, I did that!"  I just confirmed that to myself yesterday - I went in to work feeling so-so, and came out feeling wonderful.  I haven't been able to lose myself in that client work for so very long and it was loads of fun (to be honest, I didn't want to go home after 8 hours).  I don't think it was necessarily that different from your DIT approach, was it?  All I really did was make a closed list out of my current AF list.<br></div>
