I'm hoping to get in a better groove with this.  It's harder with work because I have more time deadlines (and more resistance to tasks?).</div>

<div class="content">Data are fun.  ;^)<br><br>I have one book for both personal & work - I started out just mixing everything up for a couple of days, then using left pages for personal and right pages for work, and then switched to the front-and-back method which works quite well for me.<br><br>Started on 2/11/09 (has it been a month?  really?)<br>5 pages closed before I switched to separating personal & work...  I don't track times through the pages so I don't have any info on that.<br><br>Work:<br>9 pages total, 5 closed, 1 dismissed, 3 active.  Active pages are 63% completed.  Average about 10 days between opening and closing (including reviewing dismissed tasks) a page.  3 of the 5 closed pages never had any items dismissed from them.<br><br>Personal:  <br>13 pages total, 7 closed, 3 dismissed, 3 active.  Active pages are 46% complete.  Average time between opening and closing pages is about 14 days.  Only 1 page has been completed w/o dismissing any items.<br><br>What this tells me... I have more tasks in my personal life (not surprising as "personal" now includes my work on the planning committee for a big fundraising event next month) and I do many more of my work tasks as they appear on the list.</div>

<div class="content">For Work notebook, I am holding steady at around 300 open tasks +/- 10%.  Feels great.  Feel like I am productive, in control.  <br><br>For Home, I am somewhere around 400 open tasks, and it seems to keep growing.  Feels bad.  I can never find enough time to get everything done.  I don't feel that I have too many commitments -- just not enough time.  I am trying to see how I can reorganize my schedule to make more time for home and family.  And reconsidering some of my commitments.</div>

<div class="content">I don't understand why - like Seraphim - I'm so heavy on the home tasks vs. work tasks - because I have less time at home than work?  Why???  Because much of work isn't discretionary?<br><br>Started Jan. 5 - yay!<br><br>At home:<br>25 pages total<br>3 pages complete<br>About 150 tasks dismissed (most "to do later") - my name is Jacqueline, and I am - er, I mean WAS - a dumper...<br>29 lines per page<br>Out of ~700 tasks total, about 160 outstanding<br>Average time estimated for tasks - about 20 minutes<br>So there's about 50 hours of work contained in my home book right now.  At an average of 1.5 hours "AF time" per day, that's a solid month - without doing anything else.  Eek!<br><br>At work (going from memory here) - started ~ Feb. 20, 7 active pages, one item dismissed.  About 70 open items, 30 lines/pp, so 210 total items, 140 complete.<br><br>It's harder for me at home than at work Lynn - *because* I have deadlines.  Or because I'm German, I don't know. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Here are my stats for the first two weeks of using AF:<br><br>I started using AF on the 28th Febraury using an A5 notebook with 25<br>lines per page. The front half of the book is dedicated to home<br>activities and the second half for work.<br><br>THE HOME SECTION<br><br>I'm halfway through page 14 of the HOME section with 146 items<br>currently open. Here is the distribution of the number of open items<br>per page: 5 20 17 18 17 5 6 9 9 11 10 11 8<br><br>When I started the system I wrote 126 items in the book.<br><br>In total I have added 297 items to the Home section, closed 151 items<br>with 146 items still open.  <br><br>Since the original setup I have added an average of 11 items per day.<br><br>On average I am closing 9 to 10 items a day. At this rate of closing<br>slightly less than what I am adding means my backlog of 151 items will<br>never be cleared!  Solution? Cut back on my commitments and spend more<br>time on clearing the backlog.  I am motivated to close off some of<br>these pages that have 5 items or less.<br><br>Why so many tasks for Home compared to Work? The reason is at home I<br>have many roles. My home tasks are related to personal finance, home<br>maintenance, health and fitness, my Toastmasters activities, reading,<br>DVD watching, contacting friends, home computer activities and<br>personal planning. I am married with one daughter at university,<br>and second daughter in high school.<br><br>THE OFFICE SECTION<br><br>I'm only one third of the way through page 4 of Office Tasks. This<br>section is for my work related activities of a Technical<br>Writer/Courseware developer. My work is project based so a task such<br>as "Update POwerpoints for Classroom module XXX" could take all day.<br><br>I add my lunchtime errands to this section as well, for example,<br>"Return library books" or "Buy Postage Stamps".<br><br>I have added 62 tasks to the office section, closed 47 so there are 15<br>tasks currently open. In these 10 working days, I have closed 4 to 5 a<br>day, but these tend to the lunchtime errands.  Once I have completed a<br>work task, the next one gets copied from my project plan.<br><br>MY SUNDAY CLOSE OFF BLITZ<br><br>On Sunday I was concerned about all the things I need to get done<br>before the end of the weekend. I contemplated writing a "Must do it<br>today Closed List" as if I was using the DIT methodology.<br><br>Instead I reviewed all the home pages, looking these important tasks<br>then writing them on the last page. Once I had done this, I ruled a<br>line to make a closed list.  I felt a lot better having one place to<br>look for these tasks. The fact they were scatted throughout the book<br>is probably an indication of my procrastination.  I haev to confess I<br>didnt get them all completed, but the tasks are still there for me to<br>review this evening.<br><br>I am learning a lot about myself by reviewing the AF task diary and<br>observing my patterns of behaviour.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Charles<br><br>A couple of thoughts came to mind reading your post.  You say "Once I have completed a work task, the next one gets copied from my project plan".  This sounds as if you are limiting the tasks you enter into AF which is in effect limiting the choice of items you have to work with.  In that scenario you may find that you are working longer on a task than you "feel like" because you are deciding rationally to get it done, rather than working with the amount of time your intuition tells you feels right.<br><br>The use of an extracted closed list can get things done, but this should only ever be used for items that absolutely must be done today.  There are times when you will feel uncomfortable with AF and feel that you are not getting things done that you feel you "ought" to do.  The more you learn to trust the system - ie your intuition as to what stands out to be done - the more you come to realise reasons for procrastination.  The major benefits with AF are not the number of tasks you get done but that fact that, through using the system according to the rules, you come to realise why you are procrastinating on certain tasks and what changes need to be made.<br><br>It is great that you are getting so much done, but be aware that the system is more than that ....... try not to override the system except for genuine must do items and see where it leads ....... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Thank you for your most helpful post. Now I realise I am limiting my ability to get many things done because in effect I have two systems in place --- The GTD<br>(master project/lists) for the longer term planning and the AF list boko for the tactical day to day operation.  I often have the nagging feeling of "what have I missed?"<br>and "what is next?".<br><br>I'm going to use my AF book  to write complete projects with the outcome of list of tasks that I thought of at the time.  An example is a task I have of watching all the programs in a set of 3 DVDs. I wrote the names of each program in my AF list so I have a reminder of the bug picture. It doesnt matter if I dont watch them in sequence but I see what you mean by being able to view an entire project<br>then seeing the pieces filled in, something like a jigsaw puzzle.<br><br>The GTD methodology talks about having a master project list. Well, I am about<br>to write my personal project list in the HOME section, and the work projects in the WORD section of the diary.<br><br>Many thanks for your words of wisdom.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Charles<br><br>Glad if my post was of help.  I find that for some projects I will add just the project "eg Watch DVD set" and then pick and choose from the associated tasks in that time, and sometimes I will add some or all of the tasks as individual tasks.  There is no hard and fast rule - just what seems right at the time.  It is helpful to have all of the tasks shown but be careful how you enter batches of tasks.  For example if you enter all of the episodes on one page and just don't have the time to watch any of them on the first pass, then they will be dismissed.  See Mark's blog post on "57 books"<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/12/23/autofocus-the-book-selection.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/12/23/autofocus-the-book-selection.html</a><br><br>With batches of items it is helpful to spread them out.  For example I started AF with some pretty sizeable backlogs.  I have a recurring task to "add backlog items" and periodically will add about 5 to 10 backlog items to a page.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">My spiral-wirebound (at the top) work notebook was started January 8, 2009.

Early in the book there were days that took more than one page. Later in the book there are pages with almost 3 days/page.<br><br>One of Mark's DIT principles was the need, over the long run, to balance incoming commitments with completed work. I think that AF helps me limit what I take on in new commitments. When I start to get behind with AF it becomes almost viscerally apparent. I feel stressed if I have to riffle through tens of pages open items. <br><br>I know I can always put anything in AF and dismiss it if I want and that it is incorrect to limit what I put into it. But I just don't feel like putting more trivial stuff in when my list is so palpably demonstrating to me how far behind I am.<br><br>Conversely, when I have only a small number of active pages I feel much more open to putting new things on my list.</div>

<div class="content">Moises, I have found the same thing, I'm being much more critical about what even gets on the list after dismissing a whole bunch of things that I wasn't committed to.   I'm not taking on things that I'm not totally committed to doing right now.  I'm also feeling more motivated than I have been for years.<br><br>Today, March 25 vs. March 19 above, I'm at (home book):<br><br>Now:  26 total pages (25 before)<br>Now:  5 active pages (20 before)<br>Now:  179  dismissed (124 before)<br><br>Inactive/complete pages are #'s 1-21 and active are 22-26<br>Total open items:  43  <br><br>And only 2 items that I would class as backlog items that I should have done before so it's all current stuff.<br><br>I also don't feel any desire to hop around, do pages out of order or do anything but follow AF according to the guidelines.  I do find that I'm doing a bit more off list than I had in the very beginning, but all little things I wanted to get done relating to projects that I had started and left unfinished.   (eg. instead of just moving the cold intake grate that we took off for painting the wall, I spray painted it too.)<br><br>This must be the TM Nirvana Seraphim was talking about.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Christine, your numbers absolutely floor me.  Do you feel overwhelmed at the volume of open pages and tasks?  I felt overwhelmed and depressed with just 22 open pages.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I really started to feel overwhelmed when I hit 15 active pages and again about 25 but in fact the answer now is no.  I think the reason for that is that I know "why" I have so much to do and that in itself is a major factor.  I do have backlog issues that I am having to work through and they are not going to go away overnight but they are reducing.  Those tasks would be there whether in AF or not, and although I have effectively moved some areas out that are not essential at present, the tasks that are essential are in my lists in quite a small level of detail.  That enables quick action but also keeps me focused on what needs to be done.  <br><br>I know my lists pretty well so not much gets missed accidentally, well I think I can safely say nothing has been missed accidentally for some time - although I have not done some things I "ought" to have done on time.  What I mean is that the things I have missed have not been accidental - rather that I was not prepared to deal with the reasons for resistance ........ AF does not let you off the hook!<br><br>I know that my AF lists will not be at this level for ever and the most important statistic for me is the %cleared.  Whilst addressing my backlog issues I am having to add a lot of tasks - more than I would like but having tried various methods to get around it know that this is how I need to do it at this time.  However, my % cleared is going up which is for me the deciding factor.  My current statistics are: <br><br>Currently on Page 57 - 38 lines to a page.<br><br>Total no of items to date - 2141<br>Completed - 1583<br>% Completed - 73.94%<br><br>1st 25 Pages<br>No of Items - 950<br>Completed - 857<br>% Completed - 90.21%<br><br>1st 50 Pages<br>No of Items - 1900<br>Completed - 1545<br>% Completed - 81.32%<br><br>No of Active Pages - 47<br>No of Open Items - 558<br><br>so as you can see they are actually improving :-)<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I would be interested to get a feel for typically how long people take to cycle through their open pages, which is difficult to extract from the above. I am finding that I am roughly crossing of items from the final page at a similar rate as I am adding them, which makes it quite rare for me to go back to the beginning of the active pages.<br><br>Also, how on earth do Jacqueline and Christine manage to make so many helpful comments on this forum, usually responding to queries almost instantly and still get so much else done?

<div class="content">Jaroslav, I put the finished date on the items on my pages, and my finished dates on p. 1 range from Jan. 5 to Feb. 16.  (42 days) On my last finished page, they range from March 6 - 29 (23 days).   At only 29 lines/pp and every page having something dismissed, that shows how slow I was at finishing up my pages when I had 22 or more outstanding.  Never again.<br><br>To be honest, I use the forum as a part of a task sandwich of fun-work-fun-work .   It seems to work better than my old methods of reading for fun because I can stop doing it more easily and get back into the flow of work easily.  You know I'm getting a lot done if I'm posting.:-)  Type a paragraph (can't be a whole post or I won't get drawn into the task if there's nothing to respond to), go do an item/part of an item on the list, back and forth.

<div class="content">Hi Chris<br><br>I probably circle through my pages about once a week although it can be longer.  I do know what is in my pages though so anything that is urgent is not forgotten.  My problem is that my discretionery time is erratic and I have backlog items.  As I recently took the decision to dump one of my backlog projects into AF it has had a massive impact on my lists but AF is getting it dealt with, and in a far more efficient way than I could have imagined.  I don't honestly believe I could have done this at an earlier stage of using AF because I would not have known how to include it without it overwhelming the system or being dismissed which wasn't an option :-) I'm about half way through my backlog so my numbers are still increasing slightly but will be reducing over the next week ......</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jaroslav<br><br>I actually find posting on the forum a great way to really think about how AF works and also to maintain momentum.  Like Jacqueline I will sometimes switch to the forum part way through a task if I feel I am slowing down but don't feel I reached the end of the "as long as I feel like" period.  It helps me refocus somehow, and often coincides with a "make coffee" task :-)  I also check the forum in the morning and late evening - advantages of working from home.  Not sure I dare post my stats at present or I would panic even more people - but I am feeling so much more in control despite literally hundreds of things to do.  <br><br>I had an email today in respect of a problem with our apartment lease asking for an approx time of when certain things were dealt with.  In the past I would have considered it a real problem to locate the relevant info and it would probably have sat in my inbox for way too long, eventually becoming part of a backlog.  As it was I was able to find information and correspondence (from 2003) to support the case, and scan and email it back almost by return. So - no new backlog :-)<br><br>This is where AF is really making a difference - clearing current stuff, clearing backlog, and creating the right environment to action immediately rather than allow backlogs to build......</div>

<div class="content">Sarah, interesting that your stats are remarkably similar to mine.  Unlike you, I like working on the big projects at work and not breaking them down though. :-)</div>

<div class="content">I'm curious to know how much I can get through in one motivated weekend with AF, so here's my stats at the start of the day (home).  Starting at 7:30 a.m. Saturday morning.<br><br>14 active pages #'s 26-40 - active & (already dsimissed/deleted) tasks per page:<br><br>26 - 1 (1)<br>27 - 7 (1)<br>28 - 4 (2)<br>29 - 3 (0)<br>30 - 9 (1)<br>31 - 16 (0)<br>32 - 15 (1)<br>33 - 14 (0)<br>34 - 17 (0)<br>35 - 13 (0)<br>36 - 13 (0)<br>37 - 17(0)<br>38 - 22 (0)<br>39 - 26 (0)<br>40 - 10 - partial page with 13 items, 3 completed<br><br>Only downside is, I have a visit to one of those kids play centres on page 31 !  Should be interesting anyway... to me at least (or any other accounting / finance types out there.)</div>

<div class="content">End of the weekend, Sunday turned out to be time with my son, so I didn't get done as much as planned.<br>I started at the first active page and worked through.  <br>13 (vs 14 active pages) #'s 29-41 active (vs 26-40) - active & (already dsimissed/deleted) tasks per page:<br><br>26 - 0, 1 vs 1 (1)<br>27 - 0, 3 vs 7 (1)<br>28 - 0, 2 vs 4 (2)<br>29 - 1, 0 vs 3 (0) (why am I resisting playing the piano???)<br>30 - 4, 2 vs 9 (1)<br>31 - 12, 0 vs 16 (0)<br>32 - 13, 0 vs 15 (1) (undismissed)<br>33 - 13, 0 vs 14 (0)<br>34 - 16, 0 vs 17 (0)<br>35 - 13, 0 vs 13 (0) - location specific items I couldn't do on this page<br>36 - 9, 0 vs 13 (0)<br>37 - 16, 0 vs 17(0)<br>38 - 22, 0 vs 22 (0) - again, location specific<br>39 - 22, 0 vs 26 (0)<br>40 - 21, 0 - 8 completed vs 10 - partial page with 13 items, 3 completed<br>41 - 24 items, all not completed<br><br>Darn, I added as many items as I did.  Inputting a backlog isn't fun.<br><br>I don't know why, but even though I worked on many other items, I have a problem with crossing them off as worked on when I haven't finished the job.  I'm afraid that if they are moved to a more recent page, I won't get that urge to complete like I do when they are lingering at the beginning of the active pages.</div>
