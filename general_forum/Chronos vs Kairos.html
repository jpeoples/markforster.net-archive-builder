<div class="content">Two greek words for time capturing 2 dimenions of time: As in<br><br>How long until lunch?<br><br>vs<br><br>Is this the best time to have lunch?<br><br>Time management in the narrow (chronos) sense is the capitalist view of time as money. The latter is perhaps more the layers within a moment, under the surface, available to attention that is redirected from the future and into the moment. More akin to appreciation than a need for results.</div>

<div class="content">Very interesting. I wouldn't see "appreciation" of the moment as a necessary conflict with "need for results."</div>

<div class="content">Duration versus moment, right?</div>

<div class="content">Sometimes it is possible to appreciate the moment while working. I find it goes smoother when I appreciate things rather than complain about the need to do it. Little things, like how well a tool works, or that I'm making progress, or have a new system, or the sun coming in my window, or the opportunity to have this job rather than one that's worse. It's not always possible, but being able to appreciate when I can helps, and it's easier with practice.</div>

<div class="content">Alan: you mean in the philosopher Bergson's sense? I'd agree. Easier to understand would perhaps be T S Eliot's "Four Quartets" in which Eliot expresses the idea of points at which the timeless and eternal intersect the temporal; living with meaning (transcendent) or without hope (temporal).</div>

<div class="content">"Are you come here before time (kairos) to torment us?" Matthew  8:29.<br><br>"And after a long time (chronos) came the master of those servants, and he takes up a reckoning with them." Matthew 25.19.</div>

<div class="content">One of the positive aspects of the current crisis for me is being freed of the obligation to be going places and doing things. Now I've no choice. My use of time is different. More is spent on things that are for my benefit. More is spent in recreation and leisure. To some extent I've increased poise and peace.<br><br>As we've said before on here, time management is really self-management ie time is the watering of our genius, allowing activity to bring satisfaction. Btter to think of time as filling us, rather than us trying to fill time. If we overburden ourselves we don't flourish and we won't feel satisfied. If we think we have to achieve, we probably won't feel fulfilled. An artist in contemplation surely can't feel rushed. Are they not taking time-out?<br><br>“So much of our time is spent in preparation, so much in routine, and so much in retrospect, that the amount of each person’s genius is confined to a very few hours.”<br><br>–Emerson</div>
