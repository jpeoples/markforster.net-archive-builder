<div class="content">How do you handle things like waiting for a return phone call? Several of my items are calls/email to people; once I do my part, I'm waiting for them to get back to me.<br><br>Do you leave this untouched until it's a completely finished task, cross it off and then re-enter at the end of the list or something else?<br><br>thank you.</div>

<div class="content">Ann,<br><br>I enter a new task as 'Check for reply from...' or 'Follow up... if necessary'. Then cross out the original and continue as usual.<br><br>Kirsty</div>

<div class="content">Ann,<br><br>I keep a tickler list and I check it periodically.  I don't need an AF entry to tell me to ... I do so by habit every morning.</div>

<div class="content">I use www.memotome.com and get it to send me an e-mail in a time to remind me to check if the task is done.  I started off using the list but found two things that irritated me:<br><br>1. The task could go into review mode before I could have reasonably expected the other person to have done the task.  (Thinking of waiting for items here)<br><br>2. I only want items on my list that I can do now, not a pile of stuff to do in the future.  This future stuff I just park in memotome but any tickler/bringer forward file would work.<br><br>I prefer not to use my calander for this unless the item has to be done on a particular day.  This avoids cluttering up the calender. I'd much rather get a reminder and go yep its done now or if not done say I need to follow up with X and put that down as a task on my RAF list.</div>

<div class="content">Using TaskPaper... I put an @waiting next to those items. And then I have a "tab view" for @waiting items. Works brilliantly.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Man of Kent,<br><br>When a "Waiting For" task is up for review, I know it is time (perhaps past due) to send a reminder.</div>

<div class="content">I have a Waiting For list (just a text file, leftover from GTD) and a "review waiting for" item on my AF list.</div>

<div class="content">I also use a "Waiting For" list (an idea from GTD) and have an AF task to check it, like Lazy Cat.</div>

<div class="content">If I am expecting a reply "soon", then I put a task on my AF list:  <br><br>"S/R reply from NNN by MM/DD"<br><br>If I don't expect a reply for a while (a week or a month or more), then I put it in my tickler (a 43-files system) or Outlook tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Similar to Mike, I keep a tickler file which is split out into 31 days, and I check each day in that dates file. IfI was expecting a repy to a letter or call, I just drop a reminder or the relevant papers in that day I am expecting it or want to chase up. It's easy and a daily habit!<br><br>I have 12 other files for each month so if it doesn't need to be done for a couple of months I'll put it in that month and at the start of each month I take out that months papers and sli them into the right days for that month</div>
