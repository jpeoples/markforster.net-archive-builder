<div class="content">Haven't read it Mark, but I can tell you that Steve Zaffron was a top trainer with est, and now head of Landmark Education's (Forum) business consulting group.  <br><br>What you might find with some books that are influenced by these kinds of groups is that there's a heavy emphasis on language and that you sometimes have to read them a few times to really get the concepts.<br><br>If you like that book, you might like Benjamin Zander's talk on TED:<br><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion.html</a><br><br>and the book he coauthored with his wife:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Personal/dp/0142001104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269709195&sr=8-1" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Personal/dp/0142001104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269709195&sr=8-1</a><br><br>Also Susan Campbell's book "Getting Real".</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I just remembered an article in Fast Company that I read a few years ago - it's called The Power of Words.  The est / Zaffron stuff was partially based on the work of Fernando Flores, the subject of the article.<br><br><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/21/flores.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/21/flores.html</a><br><br>And another one you might find interesting if you got value out of the book:<br><br><a href="http://www.walden-family.com/public/cqm-journal/rp07900.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.walden-family.com/public/cqm-journal/rp07900.pdf</a></div>
