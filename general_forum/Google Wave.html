<div class="content">I've just been watching the preview video for Google Wave <a href="http://wave.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wave.google.com/</a> . If it's anything like as good as it seems it could supersede email, blogs, twitter, facebook, internet chat, discussion forums, yahoogroups, flickr and just about everything else. Anyone else seen the video? (warning: it's 1hr 20 mins long!)</div>

<div class="content">I planned to watch the video in a kind of fast forward (just to get the core information). I watched every second of 1hr 20 in realtime! Amazing concept. My first thought was "boy, all the things you can do with it. It will change everything.", the second thought was "aheeem, what will it change besides email and discussion forums. nothing.", then after a while i really understood the impact this technology will have. This is the real Web 2.0.<br><br>Imagine your web site, your blog, your forum, your twitts all become one. Instant and interactive when you like it, classic/standard when you need it. (reminds me of AF Mode1 and Mode2 ;-))<br><br>Talking of twitter: all the best wishes to your daughter!</div>

<div class="content">And another potential use for Google Wave: colaborate translation of your revised instructions for Autofocus.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Mark,<br><br>In case an 80-minute video is not your cup of tea, Lifehacker has posted a condensed version here:<br><br><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5285944/the-google-wave-highlight-reel" rel="nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/5285944/the-google-wave-highlight-reel</a><br><br>I'm very excited about Wave, and am looking to replace several legacy software systems here at the office with Wave once it's available.<br><br>-palletguru</div>

<div class="content">Not to mention on-the-fly machine translation! :-) How great is that feature?<br><br>I am extremely excited about this. It's one of those things that will only take off if a huge number of people jump on board, but I think Google have made this a real possibility, since anyone can implement it on their own server if they would like.<br><br>I really hope this replaces the 50-email-long conversations about where to go for dinner!<br><br>I don't see it replacing Facebook, necessarily (though I'll be first on board if it looks like it can). However, I hope the idea of decentralized servers communicating with each other so richly does catch on and the next "facebook" won't own all of my data...</div>

<div class="content">People watching me while I reply an email.... automatic spelling correction without asking me, or me asking it to perform it....<br><br>I just watched the Lifehacker bits, but I can say... I'm not so happy about the direction the internet in general is going. Everything is flashy and gimmicky. Reminds me of Facebook letting everyone know whatever I'm doing, no matter how hard I try to set the privacy options.<br><br>Oh, well... I guess I'm just grumpy because it's 20:30 and I'm still at work.<br><br></div>

It won't all be sitting on Google's servers waiting for those increasingly frivilous writs to start arriving.</div>
