<div class="content">I have now posted a complete re-write of the instructions on my blog. In order to make a coherent whole I have extensively revised the nomenclature.<br><br>The system is now called "The Revised Autofocus System". I intend to quietly drop the "Revised" bit after a while, so you can continue to call it Autofocus or AF.<br><br>AF1 is now called "Forward Mode"<br>AF2 is now called "Reverse Mode"<br>Dismissal is now called "Review Mode". Task are put on notice for review, not dismissal.<br><br>I've also got rid of the expression "standing out" which many people found hard to understand and didn't translate easily into other languages. I now talk about tasks "feeling ready to be done".<br><br>I've also included a pass rule for Forward Mode (AF1) so that you can continue in Forward Mode if your location prevents you from doing any tasks on a particular page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi to all here in the forums, and in particular to Mr. Forster. I just discovered Autofocus about two weeks ago. Talk about an exciting time to walk into the theater - right in the middle of all the action!<br><br>I have been eagerly awaiting the expanded rules for the new system, after having studied AF1, AF2, and the rules for switching. I decided to take a crack at AF2 (without any switching) and have enjoyed using it for the last couple of days. I can't wait to try the new system.<br><br>Anyway, I just wanted to say "hello" and introduce myself, since this seems a friendly sort of forum and an excellent place to share ideas and seek guidance on implementing AF.<br><br>Thank you Mr. Forster for your work!<br>-Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>A ouple of questions about your instructions:<br><br>>>>  <br><br>Reverse Mode<br><br>Starting from the last task on the list, you read each task until you come to one that you feel is ready to be done. You work on this task for as long as you feel like, and then delete the task from the list.  <<<<br><br>And then:<br><br>>>>.<br><br>Forward Mode<br><br>In Forward Mode, you move forward through the list on a page-by-page basis. Go to the first page on which there are any unactioned items. Read through all the unactioned items on the page once without taking action on any of them. Then read through them again and take action on any that feel ready to be done.  <<<<br><br>It might just be left over from the original instructions but in forward mode are you still doing that two pass slow read, quicker read method.  And is it really different in reverse mode ... IOW, there you just read once.<br><br>A small nit, I realize.<br><br>>>> The signal to move back to Reverse Mode is when you come to a page and don’t do any of the tasks on it. This rule does not apply to the last page of the list - the one on which you are currently entering tasks.  <<<<br><br>Is there way one can get "stuck" on a page by no longer having the AF1 dismissal rule? I think this may have been discussed already but I can't find it right now.<br><br>Thanks.  I liked your new write up.  It is so much more clear this way.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>In AF2, the list was read in its entirety at the beginning of each day - I don't see this step in the new instructions. Just to clarify, does this mean after the initial line is drawn to put items 'on notice', you skip right to the end of the list and start working in reverse mode?<br><br>TIA.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I love the new write-up.  It all seems like one streamlined, integrated system.  And I think the language choices to describe the different modes are just perfect.<br><br>I'm really looking forward to giving the new system a try!  Thanks Mark!!!</div>

<div class="content">Am I alone in not loving the new writeup?  <br><br>AF1 was easy to understand.  AF2 was easy to understand.  The combination of them is not as easy to understand.  <br><br>Designers of software and consumer electronics make it a priority to avoid having "modes" in which actions are performed differently or the actions of buttons change.  Yet hear we have exactly that, with forward mode, backward mode and review mode.  I understand it because I followed the unfolding of AF from the start, but I shudder to think what a newcomer would make of it.<br><br>In my own office we offer training programmes, and are very careful not to try to teach all you need to know in one dollop.  You teach a subset, over-train in it, and when the student has mastered that, expose the next bit.  <br><br>I think explaining AF1 (or AF2) , then the other as a variation on it, then AF3 as the two combined, in separate lessons, would make more sense to outsiders.<br><br>This is not a criticism of AF1, 2 or 3, but of the way it is currently explained.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">David C:<br><br>I see what you mean. Since most of us are already experienced Autofocus users, we have no trouble with the new instructions. But for someone who doesn't know anything about AF, it could be overwhelming.<br><br>This could be the opportunity for having a small ebook. "Your First Week with the Autofocus System" or something like that. Starting with Reverse Mode, introducing Forward Mode at Day 3, then adding Review Mode and walking through a Review on the first weekend. Just an idea.</div>

<div class="content">The odd thing is that when AF1 came out I got loads of emails from people asking me to explain bits of the instructions. The same thing happened with AF2. But I've had none of that with the new instructions.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-1 12:39</div>
<div class="content">Absence of emails seeking clarification may mean that everyone finds the new instructions models of crystalline clarity.  <br><br>But it is equally consistent with oldsters understanding the instructions for historic reasons, and newcomers finding them so opaque or daunting that they wander away wihout pursuing the subject any further.</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Mark,<br><br>I'm an ex-computer guy ... I worked in development, documentation, and training, among other things so my comments on this are not just off-the-top.  ;-)<br><br>- Your instructions are much more clear than those for AF1.  I think that is not just a question of our being more familiar ... they simply read more easily.  That said, you're crazy if you don't use Andreas' nice, colored, multi-page flowchart in your release.  It really makes things easier to understand.<br><br>- Multi-mode ... yes, that is very true.  It is to be avoided whenever possible because it makes the user responsible to know what the device is doing ... rather than vice-versa.  OTOH, when manufacturer's try to scale down size, they have to deal with the problem of increasing numbers of functions (and therefore buttons) with less real estate to put them on.  This can only be done by using modes.  My Nikon D70, for example, has more modes than you can shake a stick at ... it seems, but they got it right and things just magically happen to be right where you need them when you are in the mode to use them.  Other manufacturer's ... well, not so much.<br><br>- Training ... yes, David right on that one, of course.  Your list is not exactly what he had in mind, I think.  Your list lays it all out at once, not in easily absorbed chunks with practice in between.  I think he has in mind something more like a training program (probably via email instructions) or something like that.  When we had the early discussions on the confusion over AF1 documentation and how one might explain it to others, I gave it some thought.  My conclusion was that if I were to do that, I would ONLY explain one piece at a time and then send the novitiate ;-) off to work for a while.  For example, I would not explain "dismissal" before they had filled up a few pages of their book and had mastered checking things off as done and rewriting at the bottom of the list.  Only when they reported back that there were pages that had a few items left but they were not working on them would I explain dismissal.  "We" don't have a problem understanding because we already do.  (Hell, we've beat that one to death over the months, no?)  I think someone new to AF will have just as much difficulty with dismissal under RAF as AF1.  What I think needs to be understood is that a newbie will come to RAF thinking it is a "TO DO" list and bring his understandings of a "TO DO" list with him.  The concepts of "review", "dismissal", and switching back and forth between modes are simply not anywhere to be found in his personal context.  No problem, we all learn new things, but the "strangeness factor" does have to be taken into account, IMO.<br><br>- Emails.  It might be hard to judge on that basis.  I think you'd have to get a handle on how many people were reading RAF who had not been exposed to AF1/2 before hand.  I don't think new readers are wandering away muttering to themselves, but it is hard to know unless you get some more pertinent feedback.  Somehow you'd have to solicit a group of people who've never heard of you to read your instructions and give feedback.  I'm not sure it would be worth the effort.  I think that some of us might be objective enough that when we tell you that your instructions are much more clear ... they actually are ;-)  Of course, there are always those documentation writers among us who could make them clearer ... but then almost anything can be made better, I suppose.<br><br>One other idea, just for you consideration, you might explain the AF1 part of RAF first and then draw a big line and say: "If you have trouble with that, add these steps." then add a switch to AF2.  I've not thought that through at all, but it seems to me that AF1 worked well enough for many people (myself included).  Just a thought.<br><br>For the record, I think all three of your systems work "brilliantly" ;-)  Even where I had problems I recognized that it was due to my own way of seeing things.<br></div>

<div class="content">I'd like to agree with all Mike says (except for one detail below) particularly on the excellence of all three systems.  I'm most grateful for them and the effect they have had on my life, and it's in only the spirit of making these benefits accessible to others that I question the form of the instructions.<br><br>On modes, there was once a famous article decrying them called "Don't mode me in". Looking for it on Google led me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(computer_interface)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(computer_interface)</a> which is an excellently even handed summary, and captures several of the points that I, Mike and Mark F made in our three posts on the subject.<br><br>The one area where I depart from Mike is on the flowchart.  I agree it's excellent, and maps the instructions well; but the need to have one is exactly the problem I am fretting about.  The instructions for your Canon camera likely have what amount to flowcharts to show the different states the camera can be placed in with sequential button presses.  But I can't imagine anyone would have drawn a flowchart for an iPod.  If it was necessary, Mr Jobs would have sent the device back for redesign until it was simpler.  The nearest that would get to a flowchart is a hierarchical listing of the menu structure.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>All the points you make are good ones. But I don't want AF to be something that someone has to join a training course in order to be able to understand. I want them to be able to take it out of the box so to speak and be up and running almost immediately.<br><br>With due respect to David's experience, there's never been a time in my working life in which I haven't been involved in training. After 45 years I'm not entirely ignorant of the subject.</div>

I've never been able to understand why a chart like that would be easier to follow than verbal instructions. (This is a general remark about flow charts - I'm sure Andreas has done an excellent job).<br><br>Well, maybe the iPod is simple - I don't have one so I can't tell - but I've always found Apple's website incomprehensible and I have a deep loathing for their Quicktime player which is about as intuitive as differential calculus.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I get your goal.  I also get David's example of the iPod.  I just wonder if some things are "necessarily complex" or maybe complex because of the particular user.  (In the iPod example, I don't find them particularly easy to use.  That jog wheel can be a real pain in the ass!)<br><br>FWIW, I found complexity in AF (all versions) because it did not fit my way of doing things, experience, personal context, mental processing ... whatever.  For me it took training.  (I think you've see that.)  Obviously, for some others, it was dead bang obvious, easy, natural ... and they marveled that anyone could be so confused.  Any product will lose some fraction of its possible consumer base because of such issues.  That's life.  It may just be that ignoring some of the feedback is the way to go, as it comes from those of us who are not the best fit (without extensive training) for what you have produced.  So what I'm saying is that not everyone will be able to use AF "out of the box".  Some of us will be befuddled and need training ;-)<br><br>Another way to look at this (and one I have adopted) is that it is exactly my problems with trying to make AF work (plus my intuitive understanding that it really DOES make sense) that caused me to re-think my entire system and change some parts to make a better whole.  IOW, my problems with it have caused me to change the way I do things, and I needed to do that all along.  I just did not realize it.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>Nice article, thanks.<br><br>I remember in my early computer studies having a whole course on "modes".  It was not called that ... it was called "state dependent machines" or something catchy like that.  I remember endlessly drawing "state diagrams" for programs ... perhaps you remember those little bubbles with the curved arrows showing the "flow of control" between various "states" in which different things happened.  (Damn, it's been so long, but I'll bet I still have that book around ... I never throw anything away ;-)<br><br>I was wondering about his example of the caps lock key. Yes, that is technically a mode, but it is a mode that matches what the user "might" want.  How else would you allow the user to enter upper case text.  That he inadvertantly turns it on when he does not want it is not so much a "mode problem" as it is "user problem".  Now the other examples (modes in various editors) really are problems because the user has to switch to an entirely different "context", not just want his letters in caps ;-)  Also, those modes change the functions of many other keys where as caps lock only changes text input.  (Unless, I suppose, someone writes a program where commands are case sensitive?)<br><br>Anyway, makes me long for my fun days in software development ... NOT!  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>People have different methods of learning.  These sequential learning suggestions are what drove me crazy in school.  Every term, I'd speed read all of my books to get the overall frame work and then I'd know where to focus my learning.  The sequential method always gave me horrible anxiety.....similar to walking in the dark and relying on blind faith.  Luckily I was in a great school system where I was granted special permission to have an extra couple of hours to speed read the book to relax my mind and be able to digest the information.<br>Mark's instructions are brilliant.  They are written such that both systems learners  and sequential learners can use them.  AFTER I read the overall system, then, of course, I'd learn it in pieces.  Does it really matter whether the teacher breaks it down for you or you decide the breakdown learning on your own.....especially these instructions!  It's not like he's asking you to get in a cockpit with the instruction manual on your lap to do your first solo flight without any practice.  You can decide your learning and practice methods for yourself.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>To my mind, all math was intiutive once I understood the underlying principles.  Calculus is very similar to art and music.....finding predictable patterns amid the permutations, still governed by governing principles.  Yet.........I'd go batty memorizing spelling lists!  I even took Latin to better predict the spelling.........only helped a little bit. *blush*  <br>Your instructions explain the governing principles and the rules derived from it quite clearly.....unless English which is not phonetic!  lol!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I agree that the RAF instructions are much clearer than the original AF1 instructions.  As a technical writer, I really appreciate well-organized and well-written instructions.  And the new RAF instructions just had me jumping with glee!  (almost literally!)<br><br>The one thing I *might* change, would be to move the Getting Started section to the very beginning.  Or, perhaps between the Outline and the Detailed Instructions.  The Getting Started section shows very clearly how simple the system is -- how easy it is to get started. <br><br>Another thing I liked about the AF1 instructions was the section "What can you expect from the system?"   It really piqued my interest and motivated me to read the full instructions.<br>- A greatly increased volume of work. ...<br>- A lack of stress. ...<br>- Focus on what is important. ...<br>etc.<br><br>Maybe it's superfluous, but I was sorry to see that missing from the RAF instructions.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Learning, thank you. I'm glad you like the flowchart. But the important question here is "do you need the flowchart to understand AF?". I've lately seen several people state that they don't like the fact that you need the flowchart to get AF, and I don't think that's true at all.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-1 22:59</div>
<div class="content">Regarding mode errors: modes are only a problem if the user is not aware of them. Let's take the Shift key rather than Caps Lock as an example - why isn't that as much of a problem? It's because the act of keeping the Shift key down makes you very much aware of that you are in "Shift mode" or "uppercase mode", so you aren't surprised that you type uppercase letters. There are some good examples on the Wikipedia-article mentioned above.<br><br>Now, to apply this on the (R)AF instructions I think that the risk for mode errors here are very small. If I am working the list forwards, for example, I don't think I would forget that I am in forward mode, would I? Also, let's say I do forget, what impact would such an error have? Making you do a task that you would not have done there and then had you worked the list in Mode X instead of Y? Come on, at least you are doing your tasks, eh? :)<br><br>Marks, many thanks for this system (and for your books and all insights there)!<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br>I passionately concur with you!  If somebody has the option to choose the best method  how to learn in their native style, it's always a huge bonus!  Sometimes folks assume that we think, process, learn quite similarly......not true at all.  I think it's splendid that both options are available.  I think I remember reading that Mark also intends to create a video as another learning tool. That will help the people who learn best by watching how it's done and it will also serve the auditory learners.  Sure, we can learn in modes other than our native style, but I think it's grand when we have the option to learn in our strongest learning style.  Believe me, many people are quite grateful that you took the time to offer this alternative!!!<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Expanding on Mathias' point.<br><br>The RAF "Modes" are not the same as machine modes. In a computer, camera, software program, etc., the machine itself behaves differently in different modes. For instance, Command-Delete erases a word in my text editor but does nothing in my email program. (Irritating!)<br><br>In RAF, the "machine" always behaves the same. When I grab a page, it bends and turns the same way whether I'm in forward, reverse, or review modes. When I cross an item out, the pencil draws the same way in all three modes. When I read an item, my brain sees the words the same way in all three modes. <br><br>It's like using a camera to photograph a person or a still life or an action shot, etc. The camera is the same in all cases, but I'm using it differently for different purposes.</div>

<div class="content">Actually, I think that the mode problem is applicable.  For example, in forward mode you read the page over twice, in reverse mode, only once.  In forward mode, there is no dismissal rule, in reverse mode, there is one.  The point is that depending on what mode you are in, what you do when you see the page is different.</div>

<div class="content">Let me chip in with a view here. I've been following the development of AF since last February. Back then I had also perused many of the previous postings discussing AF.<br><br>As already commented, any one of the three versions may find support by many users. What's also pleasant for me is that there is a continuous improvement from version to version.<br><br>The instructions given by Mark on the latest version are quite good in my opinion. The points made above about prior knowledge and, therefore, better understanding of the instructions may be valid. However, I would go back to something that Mark, and others, have always advocated: Try the system and you will see that it works.<br><br>It's only human to be suspicious of something new and almost natural to try and find flaws in it, before trying it out. That has probably something to do with our survival in prehistoric times (For example, "Don't eat that berry. It may poison you!", or "Don't step on that wriggly thing on the ground. It may bite you!").<br><br>In summary, I would follow Mark's instructions as written, because if they are followed step by step they are quite simple and comprehensible.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Otto,<br><br>I take your point in a limited way.  However, we are not children.  We are capable of thinking and making our own decisions.  Being human, we have learned to anticipate the outcome of our actions.  On some occasions I have advocated (with AF1) that people try it first to understand how it works.  But that comes with an apology because I think that the general philosophy of "you can't evaluate what you have not tried" is not a good way of facing the world.  I recall, in the '70's when I refused to take drugs with my friends they gave me that argument.  I always gave them the counter suggestion that they shoot themselves in the head to see if it is REALLY all that bad!</div>

<div class="content">In addition to saying that the best way to understand AF is to give it a try, I also add the important piece of data that giving it a try is VERY LOW RISK.<br><br>(unlike taking drugs or eating poisonous berries or stepping on scorpions or playing with vipers or trying GTD or Franklin Covey)<br><br>Give it a try, and let's say after a couple days you don't like it.  What have you lost?  <br><br>You don't need to completely overhaul your systems.  <br><br>You don't need spend hours reading and re-reading a book to make sure you got all the main points.  <br><br>You don't need to define any contexts.<br><br>You don't need to sort out all your possible in-boxes.<br><br>You don't need to set up a new calendar system.<br><br>You don't need to figure out what quadrants your projects belong to.<br><br><br>AF takes 5 minutes to get started.  And about 5 minutes to back out if you don't like it.<br><br>All you may have lost is the befuddlement that comes with trying to actually get things done while trying out something new.  So, I wouldn't necessarily recommend that you start AF (or ANY new system) while you're facing some important deadlines.  Wait till you've got some slack in your schedule -- just in case you don't like it and need to back out.<br><br>If you take this approach, giving AF a try is extremely low risk, and you can learn a lot from it.  And very well may find it takes your productivity and reliability to totally new levels.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br>It's interesting to see comments speculating about how a newbie might take this. I never heard of any of Mark's work until yesterday, when I was looking up a different author on Amazon. I have to admit I'm quite confused about whether any of this is aimed at me or my lifestyle at all. Typing onehanded now...I'm a sahm with a baby and a school-aged child, and I'm also a very part-time undergrad student, plus my partner's a shift worker; I am always trying to simplify my life, reduce commitments, yet gracefully accept not being on top of all things :P. I saw something about not putting time-dependent things on the list, like making dinner - yet most of my tasks are time dependent. Even the project ones, like reading for uni, become time-dependent, because it's 'do as much of this as possible before the baby wakes up'. It is at this basic level of time-dependent tasks that I am organisationally challenged, if that makes sense. I have had some success with other self-management approaches, and looking at something new is kind of a distraction/avoidance tactic I must admit. I am intrigued by AF, obviously, but I am wondering if I should be looking at this website at all? Who's it for? Executives? Scientists? People like me?<br><br>I came here because I was curious about DIT; but the fact that you've moved on from that has thrown me a lot too.<br>Confused yet respectful :)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Savitri<br><br>Welcome to the forum!  the great thing about AF is that it can be used by everyone and works equally as well in work, home or a mixture of environments.  As someone currently home based but with very erratic time availability, I have really found AF to have revolutionised my time management and only wish it had been available when I was working in a high pressure environment combined with a lot of business travel.  I would have found life much easier with AF then!<br><br>If you check out the following thread you will find answers to a lot of the questions raised about AF and how it works from the early days of beta testing.  This relates to the original version of AF but should give you a good insight to the benefits and background to the system.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br>Hope that helps :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Savitri,<br><br>The basic thing to keep in mind is that AF works best for "discretionary time".  How you define that can be tricky, it turns out, but that is the basic thing to keep in mind.  For example, if you are a factory worker and you stand at a moving belt and inspect widgets as they fly past ... you are NOT in discretionary time.  You are told what to do and you do it.  No decisions of any magnitude to make there.<br><br>If you have to file a monthly report to your boss, the "task" is not discretionary, but how and (exactly) when you do it are.  See the difference?<br><br>What makes this just a bit tricky is that we can define some of our own tasks as not discretionary, if we work best that way.  For example, my meditation is done in the morning ... that is not discretionary because I have DECIDED that is the best time to do it and ... well, that is that ;-)  So I answer to myself and tell myself that the block of time is mandatory and not discretionary.<br><br>Personally, and others differ with me, I find that AF is just one tool I use.  I embed it withing the entire system of time and personal management I use.  For example, I keep a log of phone calls and coversations, an appointment calendar, a list of goals, a list of projects, a list of "someday/maybes" (i.e. wishes and dreams ;-)  None of this is "within" autofocus, but lives alongside of autofocus and works with it.<br><br>Seraphim just posted that trying AF is very low risk.  He is right.  Just try it and see how it works for you.  You'll quickly know what works and what does not.  Keep what works ... change what does not.<br><br>One that you may observe (others have) is that AF will handles some time-dependent items.  It depends on how close the time is and how large your list is.  If your list is short so that you'll see the items on it in time to do the time-dependent items you'll be fine.  Again, try it.<br><br>Some specifics:  "Make Dinner".  Do you really think that you'll forget to make dinner if a list does not tell you to?  OTOH, defrost chicken needs to be seen in time or you'll be eating something else for dinner ;-)  But again, if you write that on your AF list today for tomorrow's dinner and you review your list at least once in the morning (as suggested) you'll see it and go get the chicken out of the freezer right then.  Or, you'll stick a Post-it on your forehead so you'll be continually reminded ;-)<br><br>"Feed baby" -- I think baby's mostly take care of that (and some other things) on their own, no?  And mothers have been raising children long before AF!<br><br>"Study for Exam" -- If you put that on the list far in advance of the exam you'll see it over and over and be reminded to do it.  And here it comes down to your own thinking method.  Do you NEED to be told WHEN to do something ... in which case AF may not be your cup of tea -- or can you take the hint and do it when reminded that you should do it soon ... in which case AF works fine.<br><br>Here is what I suggest.  You already have a calendar system of some kind ... continue to use it.  Start a new AF book.  Get some crapy book you don't care about so you can experiment with no care about the tools you use.  Write down the next few things you need to do and follow the instructions for AF1 (if you want to start simply).  I recommend AF1 because it is the simplest method.  Just scan the list in the morning, do what stands out and keep working through the list, adding things as they come up and doing things as they stand out.  Cross them off when done.  Write them at the bottom if not completed.  Etc.<br><br>There is no downside to doing that.  DO NOT PUT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE ON THE LIST.  Just add things one at a time as you think of them.  Let your list grow slowly.  Things should be added only slightly faster than they are being scratched off.  Let the list take on its own life and see how it feels.<br><br>Your intuition will tell you that some things need to be put on your calendar, posted on the fridge door, stuck on the bathroom mirror ... do what your intuition tells you.  FIRST put it on the AF list then, if you feel it should be somewhere else, put it there ALSO.  Let the system run and see how it works for you.<br><br>Let us know how it goes.  Ask lots of questions here.  We've all been through this and have probably hit every bump there is to hit ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I agree with Mike about starting out.  Follow the AF1 rules to get going.  They make it easy to start and work fine, especially for fairly short lists.  <br><br>If you are still with it after the list has grown to several pages, then consider how it is working for you and if you want to add the rest of the rules.<br><br>As someone recently pointed out in another post, AF is low cost to start and therefore low risk if you decide it doesn't work for you.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Savitri,<br><br>One thing that I found that Autofocus is very helpful for is just those things you mention - <br>I personally don't use the system for work, but have used it for home tasks with great success.  I think why it is a good system for someone in your situation is that you likely have only a few small periods of time where you can work on anything and not be interrupted.   Using AF will allow you to get your regular day to day stuff done, drop the stuff that you're not really committed to and take on new interests at a pace that works for you.  It also allows for spontaneity (this is probably more true of RAF or AF2 rather than the original AF1).<br><br>I work away from home and am a single parent, so time is in a bit of a short supply.  I've used AF to set up some routines that eliminate or reduce time dependency factors.  For example, arranging clothes (mine and son's) a week or two in advance so we aren't deciding what to wear in the morning when we're rushed.  I do some "once a month" style of batch cooking, and AF has been helpful in organizing this.   I was also a Flylady failure, but AF has me doing housework and not hating it.<br><br>All the best of luck!<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi there Savitri!<br><br>Yes! Stay here and learn this very easy, very non-distracting system!!! I have a baby as well. . . actually, she just turned one, but this system is hands-down the best thing to happen to me since she was born. I used to be a GTDer, but I really felt that I was almost creating work for myself - then the baby came, and I spent 6-8 months without even basic systems like laundry and cooking running well, let alone some time intensive system like GTD.<br><br>Here's the deal for me: when Sophie takes her nap, or when my husband is in charge of her, I grab my AF list and it's so easy to jump in and get going. I love how this system creates a sense of momentum for me - I actually get a lot done in the windows of time that I have because I'm not floundering around trying to learn a system or trying to prioritize or feeling like I should always be doing something else because I haven't chosen the "perfect" thing to do. I love how flexible the system is and how well it hooks me in to my intuition.<br><br>I think of Sophie's feeding times and so forth as anchors - I have a routine around each one that helps keep the systems running smoothly. For instance, I get up about half an hour before the baby, make a cup of coffee, decide what's for dinner and take out anything from the freezer that I need. Later, toward the end of her breakfast time, whilst she's playing in her highchair, I unload the clean dishes from the dishwasher. As I am nursing her mid-morning, I am thinking about what I'll feed her for lunch, etc. I start prepping dinner at the same time each night, so that's a habit and my final anchor for the night. I always run the dishwasher and tidy up toys before I sit down and relax for the evening around 8:30. Sometimes I take a peek in my notebook to make sure there's nothing absolutely critical that I need to do before I relax (which happened a couple times last semester, as I too, am attempting some college courses!)<br><br>Sorry this is crazy long - let me know if you want more help and details. I know how crazy life can be with a baby!<br><br>Elona (frequent lurker & appreciator)</div>

<div class="content">Wow, I am blown away with the thoughtful, kind and FAST replies! Thankyou. Okay, I will start out with trying AF1.<br>Christine, I will check out the thread you linked. Many thanks. :)<br>Thanks also to Marty for your encouragement.<br>Mike, thanks for all your insights. I too have hooked my meditation in as the first thing I do when the baby goes down for a nap. I like that you point out the distinction between discretionary and mandatory time, your suggestion to use a crappy book, and using intuition   to decide what goes where. Although you didn't quite mean this, I was thinking today about what sort of things I might AF, and that might include things that pop into my head then get forgotten, like 'give thankyou gift to birth attendant' (baby's 9 months LOL), whereas the other organisational challenges are better met by continuing to string together my Flylady routines, and doing what I guess is the same as 'little and often' - using a timer to overcome resistance (Jacqueline, I didn't mention Flylady in my earlier post in case it looked like spamming, but I've been on her list for 4 years and still find it helps - I don't do it properly though. I do however - on good days - get our clothes out not the night before, but the morning before! And I do have other parents at the school come to me to find out what's going on when they've lost their newsletters etc - so I am proud I have gotten a little more organised, at least in the eyes of some!)<br>Elona, thanks for sharing your day, it sounds like you have got a good rhythm going there between you and your little one. I like that you say AF is NON-DISTRACTING - and on that note, I'd better get off here and come back later to report on my adventures.<br><br><br>'Using AF will allow you to get your regular day to day stuff done, drop the stuff that you're not really committed to and take on new interests at a pace that works for you.'

I further suggest that you immediately dismiss anything you are not actually committed to do.  That, I find, keeps my list from becoming cluttered and growing too large with things that are mostly just in the way... AND it provides one simple place where I can find everything.  My mantra has always been: "One life, One list!"  ;-)<br><br>(NOTE: following the dismissal rule for AF1 will purge those items eventually because they will sit there, not being done, and will eventually be the last ones on a page, not get done, and be dismissed.  However, I find that asking a simple question of myself: "Am I really committed to doing this during the next week?", makes life go better for me.) <br><br>Don't worry that those world changing ideas will be lost forever ... in AF dismissal simply means that they are filed away for later consideration.  You highlight them with a marker so you can find them again later when you review the old pages in your book.  You may later decide that you ARE ready to commit to doing them in some upcoming week.<br><br>A major bit of illumination occured when my light clicked on and I realized that AF is not one list but TWO.  It is a TO DO list and also a "grass catcher" list.  For me, those two functions conflicted.  Yet I did not want to carry two books.  So I allow both lists to live as one, but I identify the "caught grass" immediately by dismissing the items and getting them out of the way of the TO DO items.<br><br>So I'd put: "Mail card to Birth Attendant" on my list and then think if I had the time, inclination, or postage to get it done this week.  If not, off it goes to be seen again (and possibly be put back on the list) when I periodically review the dismissed items.  No point being nagged and feeling guilty about something you really are not going to do this week.  If you let that happen, you'll build negative feelings about the list and it won't be able to serve you well.<br></div>

Mods?? And how long do I stick with AF1 before the next level? Should I move up to AF2 or RAF? I'm having a hell of a lot of fun, but there's also a few things I can't do right. <br><br>I'd go so far as to say that I haven't been this energised since a few years ago when I hired a life coach. This works totally differently, yet seems as powerful a motivator as external accountability is. Things that I normally build up into boring/hard seem to do themselves. So far. ^__^</div>

If it helps, Mark developed AF2 in part because we complained that it was taking us too long to get to the end of the list where the most current (hence probably most urgent) items were.  But some of us had very long lists!  If you keep your list lean and mean and are getting through it several times a day, you'll probably never want to change.  I'd say post your concerns here and we'll relate our experiences to you or point you to some of our endless gripes about why we wanted to do it differently.<br><br>YES, it is fascinating how some simple rules about reading a list can be so powerful.

<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>first time poster here, I've been reading the forum for the last few days after coming across the the AF system while surfing. I already have Mark Forster's GED book from years back, but the  AF system is news as I was expecting this site to be more about the DIT method. In any case I have been using the AF more in it's initlal form as my list is only on it's third page as of now, although I am intrducing reverse mode gradually. <br><br>A few thoughts: <br><br>It's far more effective than you would believe initially, and the reason for this I think, is that you are constantly reviewing the list rather than putting some items in one list and some in another which happens when categories and contexts complicate issues. <br><br>It needs a supporting structure as well in the form of a calendar so really urgent time sensitive stuff is always in your awareness. I have always used Outlook for this and I think I'll stick with it, it's especially useful for annual events like Birthdays, MOTs and the like. <br><br>I haven't dismissed anything yet or come close to it, but it's very ealy days and I am enjoying the process so far.

<div class="content">Svitri,<br><br>Just thinking in the shower (I don't sing ;-)  The principle behind testing list membership is that the list has a PURPOSE.  For example, if you write a list of candidates for gifts to get someone for a birthday, you don't put on the list "Water the dog", "Feed the Cat", "Buy Tomatoes".  Why?  Because the PURPOSE of the list is to gather gift ideas.<br><br>Likewise, a "To Do" list has as its purpose, to list things that you WILL DO.  Now there is where it get muddled.  Is it things you WILL do, or things you would LIKE to do, or things you feel you HAVE to do ... etc.?  How we define the precise purpose of our list will affect how well it works for us.<br><br>Most of us put a mixture of those things on our list and then gripe that it does not all get done.  Big surprise, our GOAL was not to actually DO it all, it was to record that we feel we SHOULD do it, or WANT to do it, etc.  In order for the list to work for us, it must have a clear purpose.<br><br>Now Mark got a bit dicey with the AF list and made it a combination of "To Do" and "grass catcher."  It works for him ... it does not for me.  So now I put in that filter to keep my list on purpose.  Yes, I put it all on the list, but I dismiss everything but what I actually intend to do.<br><br>Ah, I feel better now.  I had not previously been able to state that in a way that I felt crystallized what I was thinking.  Showers are wonderful ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Saviriti,<br><br>Why not jump into the Revised Autofocus, just as Mark has written it up?  I love it.  It lets you work in Reverse Mode, so you can jot down & do those items that are coming up & you feel some urge to get to today.  At the same time, you can switch and work in forward mode, to get those items, like thank you notes, that have been lingering for a bit.<br><br>I know that some people think it's simpler to start with just AF1, but I haven't seen Mark recommending that.  Why not give the system that Mark considers optimal a try?  Use it with out tweaks or hacks & just see how it works for you?<br><br>I love it & am getting lots of things done, from both ends of my lists.  Right now, for instance, I'm getting ready to take a big trip & I'm spending more time working in reverse mode doing the little chores that pop up (cancel paper, get neighbor to water plants, etc.) before travel.  Earlier in the week, I was getting more of the lingering stuff done from the front end of the list.  My focus switches naturally & easily according to my needs.<br><br>Good luck & wishing you much joy with your little one!</div>

They are dismissed as soon as captured.<br><br>I'll grant that may seem a small thing, but it is a big thing to me.

<div class="content">Yes, you got it, Joseph.  All squirrels go directly to the list then I immediately ask the question: "I I committed to do this thing this week?"  If yes, all is well.  If no, then I dismiss it right then and there.<br><br>My own dismissal method is a bit different, but not essentially so.  I don't work at a desk most of the time so I don't have highlighters handy.  If I dismiss an item I put a mark next to it until later when I am at my desk.  I mark it S (Someday), X (I'm never going to do this -- often this means the item is a duplicate found somewhere else on the list, I put the day number when something got done as the last possible mark.  X is the only odd one, I may get rid of it eventually and just mark the item as done.  For now, I don't want to "improve" my statistics by taking credit twice for something done once ;-)<br><br>When I get back to the desk, I'll highlight the S items and perhaps copy them to a "Someday" list.  It just depends.  I'm not all that religious about it now ... I've found that these transient ideas come up frequently so if I misplace one, it will be back.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ashak<br><br>Welcome to the forum and to AF!  AF is incredibly effective and as you have discovered has to be tried to experience that effectiveness.  You are right about the need for an additional calender - this was probably made more evident in the earlier versions but it is particularly necessary for RAF as tasks are somehow actioned quicker and therefore come up for review/dismissal sooner.  It is essential to have some way of capturing known future tasks that it is not possible or appropriate to do in the short term.  It works well with future deadlined tasks where the little and often approach can get things done a lot quicker than expected but if something cannot be addressed for several days it is better to wait until it is actionable before entering it onto the list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>I have seen that you are a OneNote user and I also came across a OneNote template for AF. Although I have the software which I use for Outlining, It doesn't have the same impact as actually writing the tasks down and crossing them off as you scan the lists. <br><br>It is really quite a shock to the system to see how effective the humble pen and paper can be in comparison to the new tech stuff. I am approaching the point where I am going to have only a few items left on my initial page and will have to get creative on moving those projects forward or review them.

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>That's what I thought, thanks for the further explanation.<br><br>I think you and Mr. Forster had a bit of back and forth on this topic on this or another thread. I think the difficulty he (and dare I say most?) have with your approach is what seems to us to be the unnecessary step of putting something on the list that we know we won't do. In other words, I think most people would find the idea of putting something on the list and then *immediately* putting it on review to be a bit unorthodox.<br><br>This isn't to say that AF doesn't have something already in place for items that one will not do. It has three things in place already: <br><br>1) Don't write it down in the first place; or<br><br>2) If it occurs to one *after* one had written it down tthat the item is un-actionable (e.g. circumstances change), then just delete it (no review necessary); or<br><br>3) It will eventually come up for review.<br><br>I think #2 should be highlighted as definitely part of the AF system that Mr. Forster envisioned, it just isn't explicitly mentioned in the rules, it is more of a commonsense item. Similarly #1 wasn't mentioned explicitly as it is also a commonsense item.<br><br>It's interesting to me that your system is in place in order not to clutter up your list, but it in fact *does* clutter up your list more than a "normal" AF system. Why? Because whereas you too "review/dismiss/delete" things according to options #2 and #3, you ALSO put things on the list and take them right off it (leaving a textual corpse).

<div class="content">I also use my RAF list as a "grasscatcher".  But I allow the normal RAF dismissal rules to run their course before putting something on review.  This allows the repeated exposure to the item to allow the idea to percolate somewhat.  Maybe I'll put it into the tickler to deal with later, but I don't like doing that immediately, because then I lose the percolation effect.<br><br>Percolated grass doesn't always taste very good, I suppose.

You throw everything at it and it handles it.  It seems to work that way for most.  For me, it did not -- until I started asking that key question.<br><br>Come to think about it, if I went back to my old grass catcher list and started to "work it" using AF protocol rather than keep a separate To Do list, I'd have what I have now.  I never thought of it that way.  All those years, I kept the grass catcher just to parse it into other lists later while working on another ToDo list.  Had I simply WORKED that list I'd have been the inventor of AF.

And, as to extra work and time, it is negligible.  As I seem to say here frequently, time spent rewriting things is useful to me ... it gets me thinking about those items.  But, not to make too much of it, it would be more work for me to stop what I'm doing and wrestle with where an item goes then run to find the right list (usually on the computer at home, 10 miles away).  It is far simpler just to write it down and mark it.  In fact, sometimes if I'm rushed I might not even mark it until I have a moment.  It just works so well this way.<br><br>I've long thought that two things missing from AF were some kind of filtering and prioritization.  I've effectively added those to my version of things with my challenge question and pulling today's priority items off the list onto an index card during my morning scan.  All I can tell you is that it works like a charm.  (I've not had time to complete my project of getting Excel to perform statistical analysis of my list but when I do, it will be interesting to see how I'm doing.  It feels good, however.)<br><br>>>>  For example: why not put on phone numbers and passcodes and the like on your AF list, and then immediately highlight or mark them for removal to their appropriate locations?  <<<<br><br>If the situation warranted, I would do that too.  As to passcodes, I'm at my computer when I get those so they go where they should go right then.  Phone numbers are a rarity.  I'm ususally on my phone when I get a call and incoming calls are identifed by caller ID and so are easily stored in the phone's phone book.  When I make a call, I usually look up the number and in those cases so AM at my desk.  Those situations just don't seem to come up.<br><br>>>>  Don't get me wrong, I think the idea of being able to "capture" everything in one place an excellent idea. I just can't figure out why it would *need* to be on the actual AF list and not just in the same notebook/binder/computer/ipod where the AF list resides  <<<<br><br>Because it works well for me?  I dunno.  Pre AF, I kept a separate book, and that was no problem because I worked at a desk.  It was no burden to keep a slim book in with my other books and open it in the morning and keep it open all day for scribbles.  With AF, I tried other options and they failed.  We talked about it here endlessly to no avail.  People tried to convince me I had no problem.  LOL ;-)  It was all that damn AF2 that did it to me.  With AF1 I had no problem.  As with others, the grass was bagged for disposal by the normal rules.  With AF2 I found that the list grew too quickly for those rules to operate properly.  I wound up facing dismissing items I wanted on my list because I did not act on them because I never got to see them.  I was busy dealing with an ever growing tail of the list and seldom getting back to the front.<br><br>>>>  Sorry if I am being dense about it -- just trying to understand.

<div class="content">Mike your system is helping me try some new things with my own. As I've said before, I keep GTD-like context lists though the context may be more project related than location related. It varies. This makes my AF list lean and mean as the only context-like tasks that are on my list are those that are time sensitive. The rest can wait. <br><br>The only issue I've wrestled with is how to manage all those context tasks that can wait. If I come to ORGANIZE on my main list and then refer to my associated list of organizing tasks, should I read the whole list? Dismiss the last task if I don't do it? Do whatever stands out and never dismiss? Dismissal seems kind of silly to me because these tasks are already off my radar screen since they are on an associated list. <br><br>So I am applying your rule to my associated lists and making it into a weekly review/goal session which I enjoy. For each of these major tasks (Blog, organize, etc.), I am choosing only those tasks that I think I will do this week and noting them next to the major task in my AF list. I don't plan to dismiss any of the other tasks. I think I will either delete or do them naturally. The only dismissing I do is with my main list. Anyway, hope this explanation isn't too convoluted! I appreciate your thoughts as they are helping me come up with an approach that is tailor made for me.</div>

It was so damn frustrating to pick up all that speed but not get to the older stuff.<br><br>It took a complete review (and in some cases overhaul) of my entire system before I "got" that AF was not just a To Do list but ALSO a grass catcher and that confusion of purpose (for me, at least) was the culprit.  Once I made that identification, the solution came quickly.  It only took a couple of tries to find the best way to solve it for myself.<br><br>Now I'm closing pages more quickly, I have fewer pages, I have a hot list right in front of me and my blocked schedule is also right there in the front of my book.

I too used to make uncensored lists like this, I just didn't know what to do with those lists. Now I'm happy I can note my promptings and not just feel like I'm wasting heaps of paper.<br><br>It would be fun to see a poll of who prefers which version of AF. Kathy and Seraphim, thanks for  the suggestion to try RAF. I suspect it will solve the problem, and I will give it a go soon. I do want to experiment a little bit more with AF for the next few days though. And Kathy, thankyou for your kind thoughts about enjoying my baby :). Enjoying both the baby and the 6-year-old is where it really gets interesting :)<br><br>This weekend I was very busy with urgent cooking, washing and cleaning, due to making meals for a pregnant friend, taking home the washing from my son's class, and visitors on Sunday. And I was surprised the list did handle it. Very different to the systematic Flylady way (although I did set my timer a few times :P). I thought it wouldn't handle it, because most of the urgent items were at the end of the list. But on each page was enough that grabbed my attention, relating enough to what needed to be done to handle the urgent stuff. On one page, after the visitors left, I saw nothing related to the next few urgent things. I knew with the little time left in the day, I should only be doing routine urgent stuff. Yet I didn't want to dismiss the things on that page just because I couldn't handle them that day. I was attracted to a really goofy, apparently timewasting item (Googling the character Circe from the Australian TV series 'Chances' that had popped into my head after forgetting it for many years). I was achy and tired and in danger of feeling like a drudge from rushing around all day. I put a dot next to this item. This somehow relieved a valve and instead of doing the marked item, I went and started dinner without dragging my feet. And just now I googled the item and had a good laugh. So my point is, that even with having my urgent stuff buried in the list, I still managed to address most of those things, and I also allowed the list to surprise me, giving me benefits I wouldn't have consciously created, moving with my resistance instead of butting up against it.</div>

<div class="content">Quick question re AF: if I haven't got through all active pages in a day, the next day do I start where I left off yesterday, or go back to the first active page? TIA!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Savitri<br><br>In AF1 you start from where you left off.  It is often helpful though to do a quick read through of all of the pages to ensure that there is isn't something really urgent.  In that case the "common sense" rule comes into play - i.e. "If something needs doing now - do it now!"</div>

<div class="content">Savitri,<br><br>In AF1, as Christine said.  In RAF, you start at the end of your list, IIRC.  At least that is true when you left off in reverse mode.  I'm not sure where you start if you left off in forward mode.  I suspect you start at the end in reverse mode ... at least that is what I'd do ... its simpler to remember and makes the most sense given the weight RAF puts on the AF2 orientation.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Yes you're right.  For AF2 and RAF you always start in Reverse Mode.</div>

<div class="content">Savitri: <Some spooky synchronous things have happened too.><br><br>This also happens to me, which I am grateful for. I am also open to adding whims to the list, in case they are more significant than they seem, and to allow the right-brain full sway. This might work better in AF2 and RAF because of the more rapid response.</div>
