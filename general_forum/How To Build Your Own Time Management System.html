<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Now that I have finalized my CAF system, I feel no need to look or try any other time management system.  Even my interest in Mark Forster's "How to Make Your Dreams Come True" has waned.  This is because my system, in my use of it for almost two months now, is PERFECT for me: it handles all that I need to be handled by a time management system efficiently, effectively, and easily.<br><br>And yet, I cannot remove from my mind something that Alan Baljeu said.  When Jupiter reported procrastination issues with an initial form of my CAF system, Alan speculated that<br><br>"...these things depend on the individual. A detailed system works because it suits how a person thinks and what a person does. Your system nuntym is becoming awesome for you, and in part it's because it's your system, you know how it holds together, and how to adapt it and refine it, because it's all yours. Jupiter also has his systems and adjusts them regularly. I do as well.<br><br>It takes ideas, tried, understood, and modified to suit your needs."<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1501554#item1507140" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1501554#item1507140</a><br><br>Now I know there are many people who have passed through Mark Forster's website here that have also found the perfect system for themselves...and they made them according to their own needs and specifications.  The most prominent in my mind is AndreasE who has been using his Ping Pong AF successfully for more than one year,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/12/16/review-of-the-systems.html#item10865375" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/12/16/review-of-the-systems.html#item10865375</a><br><br>Then there is Gerry with his "Write All Things In One Place" line of systems,<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com/</a><br><br>There is also 2mc with his "Flagged Tasks" AF1,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1423027" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1423027</a><br><br>And then there is Erik Lorraine with his Kanban system<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1198224" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1198224</a><br><br>I also have a feeling that Mark Forster has made the perfect TMS for himself in "Dreams," but, as I understand, he set it aside for a few years to make and try some more TMS's for the benefit of others, for which, Mark, we are all eternally grateful for.<br><br>There are of course others here who do not need to make new TMS's of their own, as they found systems made by others that work really well for them.  The most prominent example of this for me is Seraphim, who seems to have found the perfect system in SFv.3 (for which I am very happy for him: I can still remember the winces I had whenever I read his description of mountains of tasks clogging up other TMS's he previously used, leaving him stressed and frustrated).<br><br>All of these observations lead to a new idea: should we now focus on helping each other in MAKING or FINDING the perfect time management system for each and every one of us?<br><br>Tell us what you think, and if you guys like the idea, let's brainstorm on how we can do this.  I especially invite all of those who have found or made the "perfect" time management system for themselves; that is, those who have been using a particular system of time management for more than one month without finding any loss of effectiveness, efficiency, and ease of use of their systems.  For these experienced TMS users, how did you come up with the system, and why is it working for you, and what would be your tips for others who need to have TMS's of their own?<br><br>I am especially interested in the possibility of coming up with guidelines that will help people in making or finding their own "perfect" systems.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for a great idea, nuntym. I'm in. I would love to see what works for people who have found something "perfect."<br><br>Over the years, I have often added a "dashboard" to whatever system I'm using. I did it with SuperFocus (the "today list," reminding me of impending items for C2), and I'm doing it right now with "Dreams." By "dashboard," I mean a one-page overview of everything that's going on, from my appointments to the little maintenance routines, random same-day reminders, those things that are almost urgent but not quite ready for C2, etc. It doesn't attempt to tell me what to do or what order to do it in, but it tries to show me what is true right now, what's the current landscape. It makes enough of a difference for me that I keep doing it even though it is a pretty onerous process. When I go without, I overlook the dumbest things.<br><br>Of course, switching from SF to "Dreams" has really shaken up the dashboard's requirements, but I will share it when it has stabilized a bit. It is moving in the direction of a kind of enhanced, disembodied C2 that one consults alongside an AF notebook. Or, call it a "hot list." Items tend to move out of my AF notebook onto this dashboard and then stay there until they get done. The dashboard is a little bit like a kanban in that it has certain slots which inherently have limited space to fit on the page. It has no rules at all, though. It is just a sort of map to consult while attempting to work in Pull Mode.<br><br>Does anyone else use a "dashboard" / "hot list" / "map"? What does yours look like?</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Bernie: <<Does anyone else use a "dashboard" / "hot list" / "map"? What does yours look like? >><br><br>Well I do not have something like a "dashboard" / "hot list" / "map", but I think it would be beneficial for you to look up 2mc's "Flagged Tasks" AF1 system, <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1423027" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1423027</a><br><br>since his system reminds me of yours.  In brief, 2mc's system uses an AF1 list which, in the morning, he uses a max of 25 post-it transparent flags to mark those tasks that he feels are the most important things to do for today.  When a task is done, he just removes the tag. A similar system would eliminate your need to write your "hot list" into a separate sheet of paper.  <br><br>You might also like to watch Erik's videos on his Kanban system.  He also uses Post It Flags, but this time he writes on them and moves them in his system: <a href="http://www.sources.jp/I/VideoBlog/VideoBlog.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.sources.jp/I/VideoBlog/VideoBlog.html</a><br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Some guidelines: <br><br>The User may benefit from finding it easy to run the system with minimal rules or overhead. <br><br>The User may benefit from being able to get information down quickly in one place and be able to quickly refer back to it. <br><br>The User may benefit from from being able to focus on as few active tasks as possible without feeling overwhelmed. <br><br>The User may benefit from an inbuilt Continuous Improvement mechanism (e.g. Plan, Do, Review / quality cycles). <br><br>The User may benefit from a flexible system that is responsive to real life, rapidly changing situations. <br><br>The User may benefit from a feature of being able to defer things that are pulling on the User's attention for later consideration.<br><br>Influenced by: Mark Forster & Gerry, thank you guys!</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Alan: <<I totally believe this is an excellent project. I don't know where to begin though. >><br><br>Actually, what I was thinking was kinda like with Bernie: let people come in this thread and ask their questions, and the we would try to answer them or point them to the right direction using the experiences we've had.  We also post the experiences we have had in finding the perfect TMS in the hopes that other people may learn from them.  And then, with the collection of those experiences here, we might be able to make a set of guidelines in making or finding the perfect time management system.<br><br>OK let me start by trying to synthesize in a few pointers what I have learned in making CAF.<br><br>1) Experience is needed.  I have to say that CAF is the culmination of my experiences in Mark's and others' systems.  CAF has been inspired by SF, uses AF1 and AF2 as its base, took the examples of AF3 and PingPong AF in combining AF1 and AF2 but modified with symbols and methodologies that came from my dabbling in DWM2, with hacks coming from Alan's Micro-Goals, with handling of projects inspired by 2mc's system and spurred on by my experiences in the inadequacy of handling projects separately from AF and the satisfaction I felt in having everything in one place (Gerry's USGTM and SGTM).  <br><br>2) Know what you want in a time management system.   Although I keep on harping that CAF is the perfect system for me, I will be the first to admit that CAF has to make some compromises to be in the state that it is. CAF cannot be as efficient as dedicated planning for projects like mindmapping, outlining, or the like.  It can be slow in coming to unfinished tasks.  There is always the temptation to perpetually remain in AF2 which is less effective and efficient in the long run than remaining solely in AF1 mode.  It can be slow-going in looking for in-context items to add and use for AF2 mode.  However, these weaknesses are acceptable for me, because in exchange for these, CAF offers <br><br>a) compactness: no matter how I try, I could never use SF in the 3"x5" fliptop notebook I am using now for CAF, <br><br>b) accessible project handling: no matter how good a project planning methodology is, if I have to look in a separate paper or folder what tasks are in a project everytime I see the project name in my AF notebook, that project would most probably linger in the list for a LONG time.  At least with CAF, even if the planning is not as efficient, is still easier to do and more accessible to me, and thus I get things done.<br><br>c) the right pacing: this is something that I was very surprised to learn upon using CAF: in CAF, you treat urgent things urgently, and treat others otherwise.  Also, the way it handles unfinished items may be slower, but the impact on my nerves is less, and I still have no excuse to not finish those items when I come upon them.<br><br>There are other benefits, but these three are the most important because <<these are my ideals for TMSs since I started using AF!>>  All the aborted attempts I had in making the perfect TMS (and they were embarrassingly many) had these goals in mind.<br><br>3) Do NOT be limited by the form of the TMS you are getting inspiration from.  My inspiration, as I had said, for CAF was SF, but when Jupiter noted that she was having procrastination issues with her use of it I realized that maybe trying to deliberately make a SF one-column emulation was limiting its development.<br><br>4) Simplicity is a good sign that you have made a good TMS.  <br><br>Hmm, I think that's all I can think of for now.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Yes I confirm I am a man :-)<br><br>I am still testing a new system. It is based on a post I red in this forum "the simpliest guide to management system' and it is on paper. Why ? Just because the control and the reactivity is indeed much better. The way I have adapted it is 80% GTD and 20% autofocus NOT Superfocus. For the moment I like it. But I feel free as Alan said "to adjusts them regularly". <br><br>I decided To test it on paper because it is the only way to see if the system is able to do it in the tempest. Computer or ipad is nice but take me too much time. <br><br>The basic ideas are contexts, projects, daily list if needed, and ONLY one place for all. <br>I keep the system simple and try to make economies about reporting. The less I will will be the best. What is indeed valuable in my actual way is the way I use MF rule about double reading. (It's like with autofocus). The other way is about dismissing I fel natural to dismiss tasks one by one on the flow but not page by page. <br> <br>I use a lot my pages context @Call and @Mac it's nearly full. <br>I also use a lot my page @Follow. <br><br>If you want to know more about my system just have a look at my blog (it is in French)<br><a href="http://gtdway.blogspot.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://gtdway.blogspot.com/</a> If I read the first comments the system seems to be worth by others.</div>

Not that long ago, I'd have laughed at the suggestion to spend time managing my time.<br><br><<unless discussing time management IS your work of course>><br>This must create an amazing paradox: if time management is your work, then it is robbed of its value for goofing off and delaying. One might instead revise the annual budget or paint pictures, whereas an accountant or painter would fiddle with time management. You must have found your true calling, Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Bernie,<br><br>I'm intrigued to see what an example of your "dashboard" looks like.  I currently use SF with a few tweaks, but no dashboard.  One of the tweaks is that I don't allow a C2 on the last page. I use the C2 space on this page for my "Big 3" tasks for today, which I write on a post-it. So there is some double-entry of tasks between the pages of the SF notebook and the Big 3 on today's post-it, but three items isn't very burdensome to rewrite. I consider today to be successful if I've made good progress on (or better, finished) the Big 3.  I'm wondering if a more-complete Dashboard would have a potentially negative effect on SF, in that there is value in trying to circle around the list fairly rapidly, perhaps a few times each day, to let your subconscious pick things that stand out at different times. If I had everything transferred to the Dashboard, I might not feel the need to flip through the pages at all during the day.</div>

If I had everything transferred to the Dashboard, I might not feel the need to flip through the pages at all during the day.>><br><br>Precisely, ubi.<br><br>In my early days of SF, I constructed a nice dashboard which quickly usurped my attention and left SF at a standstill. Then I revised it to function similarly to the way many people use Outlook, as a source of C2 reminders culled from various sources such as my calendar, weekly workout routine, children's after-school schedules, etc. There was a thread about this sort of thing, called the "today list."<br><br>Why didn't I just use Outlook? (a) I spend a lot of time away from the computer, and (b) I want a big picture, on demand, of what today's reminders are going to be.<br><br>In turn, why (b)? Working from home, my time is very unstructured, and I don't seem to have the kind of mind that holds schedules easily; there is something about time that does not compute. I need some sort of look-ahead to avoid putting myself in situations where I miss time-sensitive things.<br><br>For example, many evenings I have discussed with my wife an elaborate scheme to pick up the kids from school and drive them to various parallel destinations, only to forget all about it entirely by next morning. Of course, I immediately recall the whole thing later on, when she calls me from some parking lot where I was supposed to meet her, but right up to that moment I really hadn't the faintest idea I was supposed to be somewhere (this did not happen 100% of the time, but maybe 40% which is still pretty dysfunctional). We fixed it by making sure that whenever we make these sorts of arrangements, one of us is writing down my part of it. As long as it's written out, there's no problem.<br><br>Now that I have a dashboard, I always put that stuff on my dashboard, and I never miss. I love my dashboard!</div>

<div class="content">@Bernie, I'd love to see an example of your dashboard or to have more details about the type of info that's on it.<br><br>I have the same kind of mind-like-a-sieve, where I can read my calendar the night before, read it again the next morning, and still mess up. I realize I've tried dashboard-like approaches, but have never really formalized it. <br><br>Most often I'll use a large sticky note with my appointments for the day and any "must-do's". I sometimes put "big rocks" on it. <br><br>Since doing Dreams, I've been really sporadic about how I use SF and dashboards, because I'm worried about losing the pulling effect. I wait until I feel pulled to knock off my SF tasks, or to at least scan them to make sure I'm not forgetting anything. I've also been worried about a dashboard having the same effect, so I'm mostly using it as an aide-memoire. When I use it, I put on it things that I think "should" be done that day as a way to keep them in front of my face, but I don't do them unless I feel pulled to do them. Obviously, I'm still trying to work out the role of supporting structures. :)</div>

<div class="content">I agree with your 1,2,3 steps. You're on the right track I think but I would debate two poInts:<br><<we all have ideas of what the perfect time management system unique to us is, and those ideas are most of the time true, although we'd have to weed out the false ideas before we can make the perfect TMS emerge ready for use.>><br>There isn't one perfect TMS for one person. Rather there are certain qualities that a person needs. Many varied systems will meet those needs and infinitely more won't. So the challenge is not to find the correct solution but to craft a system to match the needs. <br><br><<think you already have known (probably subconsciously) what you've always NEEDED (eg. keep all things in one place, A-Z filing system, simplicity, etc.), >><br><br>I doubt Gerry knew beforehand what was needed.

<div class="content">I don't think I consciously knew I needed to write on one place.  I just knew things occasionally slipped through the cracks and did not get handled.  I did not like the feeling that I was not on top of things, which was occasionally pointed out by a boss or myself.  Additionally, I am not a gadget person.  All of these factors led me to seek out paper time management systems.  They were all too complicated for me, especially GTD.  This led me to try to devise my own.  I studied those who were productive and those who were not and found that one of the least productive people I worked wrote in hundreds of places and wasted time looking for things, while several people who seemed to not forget things wrote in one place.  I combined this with what I thought was a simple idea in GTD the A - Z filing system and wrote my first ebook.  Where I personally wasted alot of time was trying to make money from it LOL.  I am one of those who believe a time management system makes you more productive by causing less wasted time finding things more so than it speeds up work or "makes" you more productive, so I just keep it simple.<br><br>Additionally, I set out on a similar journey to find a goal achievement system,.  This time, however, I just designed what made sense to me, since I did not have access to what people use in this regard.  This led to DO IT.  I really need to pick it up and use it again for some life goals I want to accomplish.  <br><br>Thanks for the question.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">This is an interesting topic. I have though about it a bit. People are so different, that making the ultimate TMS is not possible, I guess. It may be better to build up a toolbox with different tools you can add to your TMS. <br><br>So say that you have a not to complicated life, you could pick the tool 3-things. Each day you pick 3 things you want to do. (There is a web-site for this system, but couldn't find it. Here is another link: <a href="http://babblermouth.blogspot.com/2007/08/3-things-time-management-for.html)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://babblermouth.blogspot.com/2007/08/3-things-time-management-for.html)</a> If you have a more complicated life you could pick some other tools, and if you are procrastinating there are several tools you can add to your system to overcome such a thing.<br><br>The challange is to make the toolbox and to connect the tools to the situation you have in your life, and maybe you will have different TMS for work and for home.<br><br>Just some thoughts from me.<br><br>Hans</div>

But all my experiences leads me little by little to a kind of method which suits with me. <br><br>I still dont know for example if I wish a digital or a paper system. Both as advantages. Both has inconvenient too. <br><br>Anyway I understood 3 major principle and some ideas I shared with one of you and which I thought could be useful may be to others. <br><br>Here are some of the first rules of Thumb I wrote in Omnifocus. <br><br>1. There are 2 fundamentals aims one is CONTROL the OTHER IS PERSPECTIVE<br>2. About controlling no mater what you use but I absolutly must put everything in ONE PLACE. If I mutiplates the tools I multipliate the problems. <br>3. ELIMINATE and FOCUS on a small aims is the KEY principle to be efficient. So ELIMATE, DISMISS do what tou want but TRASH projects, tasks, notes and so on... And FOCUS one by one. AND IT MUST BE SIMPLE; The most you CAN. <br><br>Cleaning regularly the system, using the HOLD of the project, putting everything in one system, using Of as a guide but not a master, avoiding paper and too many tools, taking time to work on project, working mostly with the ipad except when it is too complicated, are some of my recipies.<br><br>The problem is not the amount of information but it selection</div>

<div class="content">Here are some of the things that *I* think every person needs in a TMS:<br><br>1) A system that you WANT to use.<br>   ToodleDo failed for me because, while having an online list was cool, it was just another gadget. A $0.50 3"x5" flipbook failed because it was just a cheap notebook. GTD was, for me, great for identifying my tasks but horrible at getting me focused on doing the work. I went to the store, found a book that I LIKED; that felt GOOD in my hands; that APPEALED to me. Now, I WANT to use my book, so I'm drawn to use the TMS within it. My book is not fancy. It is not expensive. But I like it, so I use it. And SF keeps me focused on being productive, so I use that.<br><br>2) An understanding that no TMS will do the work. That's still your responsibility. <sheepish grin><br><br>3) An understanding of the TYPE of work that you do and how the various TMS deal with those different types of work.<br>   As a software developer, almost all of my work is in the form of projects with committed features. Someone working in a call center would have fewer projects with more urgent tasks. A server support guy would have more recurring tasks and urgent tasks and very few projects at all.<br><br>4) An understanding of what YOUR difficulties are.<br>   Do you have a hard time starting big projects? Do you have a hard time finishing what you start? Are you easily distracted? Are you frequently interrupted? Are you just lazy? (That's me. sad face) Different TMS address these problems in different ways.<br><br>I really like "Hans V" idea of approaching each TMS (or the parts thereof) as "tools" and finding the right "tools" for the job.</div>

<div class="content">Just a little add to this very interesting thread thanks nuntym :-)<br><br>I noticed in my job (real estate) 90% of people use a single A4 spiral note book. <br><br>I often wondered how people used it and in fact it is very simple they use it on the flow writing the page date and all what is incoming per day and they reserve some pages for some specific projects. Then they review it regularly. In fact the notebook can easily be a mess but never mind the most productive people I met did not really care about organization they just did things. <br><br>But I have to add too that Ipad and smartphones did not really existed. They have changed our life but I am not sure in the right way. All becomes too fast now. Too reactive. This may be the reason what people have so many difficulties in this world. <br><br>Imagin the 15th- 16th century when leonard de Vinci draw and imagined all what he invented there was no computer, no emails, no web but human relationship. <br><br>And when I began real estate in 1986 there was no computer, no fax nothing but we were doing business yet like now. <br><br>I am not against progress but I am share about this new world on a hand things are getting easier thanks to the technology on the other hand the amount of information is so huge that is becomes very difficult to dismiss, eliminates, sort and act about tasks. <br><br>I think we have to be carefull about mails, and what ever can be the system we use it would be better to make it easy and simple.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter,<br><br>You write that «when I began real estate in 1986 there was no computer, no fax nothing but we were doing business yet like now.»  Really?  Some version of the fax machine has existed since the mid-1800s.  They were quite common in the U.S. in the 1980s.  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax</a> for some fascinating history.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, back in the 60s and70s and early 80s there was a lot less information to process. Think about it. No internet. Libraries with card catalogues instead of databases. Letters coming in by mail only. The pace of life was slower, more balanced. There were also more boundaries between work and home. Oh, and managers (who were almost always male) had secretaries to organize them. That's how we managed. :) <br><br>Sigh. Even though I'm a geek and embrace technology, I sometimes wish for a simpler life.<br><br>But it makes me realize that intentional, mindful living is more important today than ever. And Dreams helps me to get back into that space of thinking about the big things, connecting to my deep desires for my life, and living out of a different part of myself than the part that is activated by technology. <br><br>So I'm starting my day grateful to Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I'm sorry, but I have to chuckle at your comment. I started my working life as a reporter in 1984 and green-screen CRTs had just come in to the little town where I worked and displaced all the Linotype and hot-metal typesetters. Computers were Apple II or Commodore 64s, and they were mainly for games-playing or dialup on 300 baud modems. (Geez, I sound like a geezer!)<br><br>Anyway, back in those dark dark days, we used lots of file folders (there was a whole culture and methodology to using file folders and tickler folders), Day-Timers or Day-Runners, and I enjoyed (sometime in there) Stephanie Winston's book "The Organized Executive," which had lots of great task-management and scheduling techniques. <br><br>But yes, it was a less-connected time (both socially and electronically), and tips tended to be passed down to me by more experienced managers or co-workers. Though there was always someone in the office who always got their work done quicker than anyone else and never needed all the time-management stuff I was obsessed with. Some things never change :)</div>

For more than you ever wanted to know about that, see the following new thread:<br><br>"KEEPING ORGANIZED WHILE PURSUING 'DREAMS'"<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1536177" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1536177</a><br><br>For anyone following the "Dreams" methods, I would love to read about your organizational trials and errors too, even if "Dreams" has Pulled you away from strict "time management."</div>
