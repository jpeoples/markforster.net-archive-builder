<div class="content">Hi Bob.<br><br>Terse question.  <br>Terse answer: AutoFocus 1,2,3,4, and now DWM.  Autofocus versions are summarized top-right corner.  DWM has some recent blog posts.  There is no "Best Practices Summary".</div>

<div class="content">There is some kinda script written by someone here that lets you simply read just what I have written, that is where I would start.<br><br>It's pretty much how I use this place. It is quite helpful.</div>
