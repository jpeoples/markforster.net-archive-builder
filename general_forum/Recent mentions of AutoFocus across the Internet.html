<div class="content">Clearly English isn't the first language of the chap in the first link, but as far as I can make out, his system is one open list, which you must tackle from the first item to the last, but you are free to reorder the items on the list whenever you like.<br><br>Now that really *is* "just a to-do list."</div>
