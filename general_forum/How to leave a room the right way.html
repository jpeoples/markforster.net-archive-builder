<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-29 18:51</div>
<div class="content">Unlike those who stamp their feet, this is how you leave a place, if but for a while.<br><br>As much as I would like to quibble over the minutiae of thinking or shame vs. guilt (which unlike the first is a decent thread):<br><br>I have had an incredibly painful personal loss. Although AF might suggest otherwise, I have a feeling that posting to this forum (or any other) might not stand out for a while. (Which in this world where time is measured in microseconds might not last very long.)<br><br>One thing I am certainly glad of is that I know AF will be of great help (maybe even more) during this time, because I doubt my rascally notions of what is important will get in the way as much. And for that help I am as always grateful.<br><br>Constructive Living is also another wonderful refuge.<br><br>When word and thought fail, a list remains. One item stands out, another withdraws and another is lost forever. The one lost and mourned and let go highlights our selfish hopes and dreams and fantasies.<br><br>When the world grows dim in the blinding light of the one lost and even feeling fails, service groped at remains. Dishes washed, days worked, deeds done in goodwill reveal the world once again, if only an item at a time.<br><br>Enough of the poorly written, melancholic, poetic prose!<br><br>Just thought I would give you a heads up on the soon peaceful and tranquil nature to come.<br><br>Rejoice!</div>
