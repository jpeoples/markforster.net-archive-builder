<div class="content">Rather than get rid of dismissal altogether, I think it's more helpful to make it discretionary.  <br><br>Retain the concept, and the nomenclature and highlighting and review of dismissed items.<br><br>But make the process of dismissal discretionary.   If the page has "gone stale", then dismiss everything on it.   It's your decision what "gone stale" means.<br><br>No force, no pressure.  <br><br>This worked so well for me before, that I am including it in my current test, which is AF1 with these caveats:<br><br>- AF1<br><br>- Start the day with yesterday's first page<br><br>- Enter new items into the tickler for TOMORROW<br><br>- Discretionary dismissal (not forced dismissal)</div>

<div class="content">Sort-of-related question:<br><br>With this current setup, I am still feeling at a loss how to handle projects.   <br><br>I am trying to keep in mind Mark Forster's dictum - "only as much organization as you need - no more, no less".   Here are the issues I keep coming across.<br><br>On one hand, if I enter a single item, "Review Project XXX", into my AF1 list, it tends not to stand out, because I don't remember the actions that are needed -- there is no sense of pressure, no "hook" to pull me in.   <br><br>On the other hand, if I enter specific project-related tasks into my AF1 list, they tend to get scattered across many pages, and I can't keep track of sequential dependencies and other relationships between the tasks and the overall project. <br><br>Also, if there is a new task (e.g., a new thought; a new email; a new meeting) that is related to an existing project, I need a quick way to capture that task and associate it with the other project-related tasks, so I can see them all together.<br><br>The obvious solution (obvious to me, at least), is to re-introduce project pages into my system, just like I had with AutoDIT.   But this is a significant departure from AF1, and I am trying to see if there's a way I can do this, without departing from AF1.<br><br>Any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">Two words:  FreeForm Notebook.  Add a page called "Project XXX" and then your AF1 list can contain things like "Review Project XXX" or "Update Project XXX" or "Do next task for Project XXX" or whatever works.  You're still working the AF1 system, but you have your essential project-related details right there in the same notebook, interspersed with your AF1 pages.  I don't think this is a significant departure, as Mark has stated that AF is not a project-management or -planning system, and I think he always envisioned using the AF notebook along with other supporting materials (e.g. his "just get the file out" strategy to overcome resistance.)  It's up to you whether you manage and carry around other files, lists, books, etc., or try to incorporate side lists, notes, etc. in a single FreeForm Notebook.<br><br>BTW, I didn't know you worked on a XXX-rated project!  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">To fill in a blank from ubi's suggestion:<br>Have your project in the AF sequence. It's a page to look at as you cycle around, but not a page to work in as it isn't an AF page. However, seeing it may inspire you to add a task to AF, either a task from the project, or "work on project XXX".</div>

Regardless of the dismissal rules followed, some pages immediately feel stale when I reach them, and some don't. Marking stale pages as stale shows me "what's true right now."<br><br>How does this differ from original dismissal? It gives dismissal a real meaning, to which I have a consistent relationship. The original way meant merely that I hadn't felt like doing any of those items last time I visited the page (maybe I was in a hurry or not in the right place or not yet under sufficient pressure, etc.), yet the page might still have contained all manner of nearly-urgent, important, or other un-ignorable items—it was definitely not stale. But if we change dismissal to mean "stale" outright, then I won't need to scan that page's items unless I am in the mood to review stale things, perhaps when I've finished a big project and am looking for something to come back to.<br><br>As the old adage goes, "Don't tell me what to do, just show me what's true." Well, if it's not an old adage, it ought to be.</div>
