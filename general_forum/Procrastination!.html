<div class="content">Could use some help here. First of all, I have a terrible habit of procrastinating and AF doesn't seem to be helping. I'm not blaming the system, I'm just looking for advise.<br><br>I guess I equate standing out as wanting to do (maybe that's part of the problem) So when I scan a page the only things that stand out are the easy/enjoyable tasks. <br>The big/important/urgent stuff gets bypassed until all the easy stuff is done. When I finally have to tackle the ugly stuff, I use the little and often approach. The problem is, I only spend a couple of minutes on these things then re enter them on the last page. So in other words, the important or urgent stuff isn't get done effectively.<br><br>Any advise.</div>

<div class="content">I agree! I also don't blame AF, in fact, AF has helped me in getting over procrastination. However, still procrastination is a kind of problem!! Advice welcome!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I am a monster procrastinator too and have the same problems.  What I have found is that with AF, at least I'm making progress on things since they are constantly in my face if I review the list.  It's the just "open the file" concept at work.  It becomes irksome to see things lingering on the page so I'll do something just to move it forward to the end page and I've found that just because of that, I'm getting a lot done.  One of my big problems is that I'll stop looking at the list because there's something I just don't want to do and then it's all downhill.</div>

<div class="content">I don't know if any of you have read Mark's Do It Tomorrow, but he has a couple of very effective procrastination busters in there, and both work very well with the AF little and often approach.<br><br>The one that works for me is working in bursts. ie you commit to working on a task for 2min (Mark actually suggest 5, howeverI use 2 since you barely start and you're done, but you overcome inertia).  Then move it over to the end of the list.  Next time 5min, then 10 - 15 - 20 etc until you reach a maximum comfortable number.  Actually, by then for me resistance in AF is over and no more problems on that task.  <br><br>Two important things to remember:<br>1.  The limit is the limit - use a kitchen timer or pc timer and when it rings you stop even if in mid sentence.  Actually this more than anything overcomes the resistance by the time you get to it the fourth time.<br>2.  You have to remember how long to work on it next time so remember to write how many minutes to do when it's next on your lists.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br>As an aside - having just read it again, Mark's book DIT is a brilliant complement to AF if you just use common sense and ignore the DIT method specific bits.  That still leaves about 75% gem of a book with wonderful tips that work brilliantly with AF</div>

<div class="content">I have struggled with procrastination for as long as I can remember and AF is the one system that has been able to deal with that.  Mark describes it as virtually eliminating procrastination and I have found that to be true BUT there are a few things to take into account.   <br><br>Bill, you say "I guess I equate standing out as wanting to do (maybe that's part of the problem) So when I scan a page the only things that stand out are the easy/enjoyable tasks. " You are absolutely correct in that assessment; that is how the system works - by doing things when we want to do them there is no procrastination.  However it sounds as if you may not be using the same approach to the items you describe as "the ugly stuff" and go on to say "the important or urgent stuff isn't get done effectively".  <br><br>Firstly AF works with the intuitive side of our nature as opposed to our rational side.  We are used to working with rational decisions as to what is urgent and/or important.  Sometimes however there are other factors at play which our rational mind never gives us time to fully appreciate.  With AF, by doing what our intuitive mind suggests, it is common for those items we perceive as urgent and important to be "left aside" for a while.  The natural reaction to that is to panic, start to think that the system isn't working, and go back to our old habits of forcing ourselves to do tasks as opposed to actioning them when they stand out (we feel like doing them) and of course all of the old feelings of procrastination come back with them.  Yes there is always the "common sense" rule (if something HAS to be done now then do it now) but if you can allow yourself to wait and, as Mark says, "trust the system", you will invariably start to see the reasons for that procrastination. <br><br>We tend to equate procrastination with laziness but in fact it is almost without exception the result of our subconscious resisting the task in question - and our subconscious WILL have a reason.  The key is in identifying that reason and THAT is how AF works. Procrastination is not a problem with "you" - it is your subconscious trying to tell you something.  Yes procrastination busters are a fantastic tool - and Mark's ideas are second to none in these areas.  However they are only a tool - like a paracetamol they deal with the effect but not the cause - and it is the reason for that procrastination that we need to identify.<br><br>People have found that AF has identified all sorts of factors, some have found they are in the wrong job, others have found that the resistance to one item has been as the result of something seemingly unrelated, and it is often not until those apparently high resistance tasks are examined objectively that some of those reasons are identified.<br><br>The little and often approach works amazingly well with AF and for those tasks where the issue is just the difficulty in getting started, or the perceived enormity of the task, then "little & often" or just rephrasing is often enough to make progress.  However in other cases there are possibly deeper issues and AF is the one system I have found that can provide the environment to look at those.<br><br>If you are relatively new to AF you may not have seen all of the early discussions - the following link to the FAQ's thread provides links to posts that may answer a lot of questions in this area.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, I sympathise. I'm something of a black belt procrastinator myself. I've had a copy of "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest" on my bookshelf waiting for me to read for the last 22 years! One day... :-) <br><br>With me, it's mainly indifference that's to blame. I'm just not interested enough in many tasks to do them. A bit like wanting to learn to play the piano say, but not willing to commit yourself to spending years on the task, but on a much smaller scale of course.<br><br>As far as the "Little and Often" tool is concerned, I would suggest you're wasting your time spending just a couple of minutes on a high resistance task. Maybe, just maybe, just to get you started, but only the once. I'd go for a minimum of 20 minutes but 30 would be better. Twenty minutes isn't so very long. Use a timer and tell yourself you are going to concentrate on that task and nothing else and then give yourself some sort of reward immediately after. Spending only a couple of minutes at a time on a non-trivial task is like trying to read a book a couple of lines at a time. Pointless.<br><br>Oh yeah, and I once took 15 years to wire up a pair of speakers. But I least I completed that! <br><br>Everything comes to he who waits - but sometimes Death gets in there first ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">I think the problem with demanding you spend at least 20 or 30 minutes on a task (especially early on) is that you will start to resist getting started. So you won't end up doing those 20 or 30 minutes you committed to, and the task won't get moved forward at all. <br><br>However, if you only commit to doing 5 minutes of it at a time, you're much less likely to feel that resistance, and at least you'll get *something* done. And there will be times when, after the 5 minutes are up, you'll find you just want to keep going. <br><br>And, if you're reaching a deadline on that project or task, and find that you do have to commit larger chunks of time to it, the fact that you've been chipping away at it in small 5 (or more when you felt like it) minute blocks will make it feel less overwhelming.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with the little and often approach. A 20 minute requirement kills productivity. We tend to overestimate the difficulty and time requirements of tasks but this pays off when we return to a task we've done a little on. We tend to overestimate how much work we did on a project last time reducing our resistence. I have also been relieved as AF has given me permission to dismiss tasks I really don't want to do. Stick with it!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Bill<br><br>Maybe you are not breaking your big/important/urgent stuff down enough? Also have a look at the tips about rephrasing tasks on this forum (maybe the FAQ) , this does seem to make a huge difference.........<br><br>I too struggle with procrastination 20 years!</div>

<div class="content">I think one way AF works for me is that I can choose what to do at any given time.And often completing an easy thing gives me the momentum and feel good factor that I can then carry on to harder tasks.I see the whole AF list as a project(my life) and where I start doesn't matter cos I know what's important will get done without resistance when the time is right.And many small bites of the task do eventually get the job done before you know it<br>Jay</div>

<div class="content">When faced with a malodorous task that "stands out" (or rather, insists that it not be dismissed), I also use a timer.<br><br>But rather than predetermining a rule for how long to set the timer, I determine how long to work on the repugnant task, at the moment it stands out.<br><br>If it's only 2 minutes, fine.  If it's 20 minutes, fine.  Whatever feels right at the moment, whatever number pops into my head.  Don't agonize over it.  Just set the timer and get going.  <br><br>Usually, once I get going, the task suddenly and inexplicably picks up momentum and keeps me going for an hour or two, or more, and doesn't seem so horrible.  But if that doesn't happen, at least I did *something*, and the task gets re-entered at the end of the list.</div>

<div class="content">No system is going to transform you to a superperformer overnight if you are a hardcore procrastinator. Procrastination, the learned habit of not doing things you should do, is hard to overcome. You need to slowly develop yourself. <br><br>Spending a couple of minutes on a task is a good start. It is better than not doing them at all. Next week, if you spend a few minutes instead of a couple, you have progressed. Congratulate yourself on the achievement.<br><br>AF is a good system (as is DIT) to beat procrastination so stick with it. If you spend only a little time with those easy tasks but make progress, then you are on a good path. Expect setbacks, but stick with the system. Use also techniques e.g. those presented<br>in Mark's first book to reduce resistance.<br><br>I used to be a totally irresponsible procrastinator who got nothing done. I hated my work, my self-esteem was low. Then I found DIT (all in all I made decent progress but had also bad periods), now AF (slow start but now works well).<br><br>It has taken me two years but I am not there yet. Today I get quite much more done but there is still a lot of room for improvement. But now I trust myself that by persistently operatingly the system I will improve.<br><br>I hope you can improve yourself faster but be patient and persist. Remember, no system is going to change your habits. It is only you who can do it. These systems are there just to help you.<br><br>It is also easy to get fascinated by new systems. People expect that a system is going to magically change their performance. A new system with all the excitement will<br>give a boost for a few days or weeks. Then the effect will fade away and people feel it is the system that is not working. They fiddle with the system or search for<br>a completely new one, get the short-term performance boost, that diminishes, readjust their system… and fail to consistently develop themselves.<br><br>If you have not had regular physical exercise for years, do you think you can just by that take up running 10k five times a week, only because you bought new quality running shoes?</div>

<div class="content">Niko makes a very good point - that all new systems need practice before one gets the full benefit of them.<br><br>The question to ask is: "How long have I been training myself in bad work habits??"</div>

<div class="content">I get the point you are better doing something rather than nothing, but watch out you aren't using AF itself as a tool to procrastinate with. Say you work on a task for a few minutes, you might continue on with that task and that's good. But if use working on a task for a couple of minutes so that you can add it to the end of the list and delay putting some real energy into it, then you're still procrastinating. You're still saying, "I'll do it later." <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Kevin<br><br>My experience suggests that brief spurts of a couple of minutes does not encourage procrastination.  Quite the contrary.<br><br>An example: For a full week I have been resisting teaching myself how to produce a slide show using Photoshop Elements.  It has felt like an enormously difficult project.  One day I made a start by opening the program, finding a description of how to do it and printing it off.  That took three or four minutes.<br><br>Yesterday, I opened the program again and followed the instructions.  I had a full slide show produced with background music and all in about twelve minutes.  I showed it to my wife and she thinks I am a genius.<br><br>She's probably right, but more importantly I reminded myself yet again that "making a start" is perhaps the keystone of every great achievement.  And a couple of minutes is almost always a useful start.</div>

<div class="content">Jim<br><br>I'm not denying that a few minutes is a useful start. It's just that if you never go beyond those few minutes I can't see how you would ever finish any non-trivial project in a reasonable timescale. It seems to me that you're not committing to a task if the only reason you are doing it is to avoid having to dismiss it from your AF list. There is also the danger you are going to start lots and lots of tasks and may never really make much progress with any of them. I quite agree that "little and often" is the way to go but I'm just trying to point out if you make the little too little then you'll waste a lot of effort just task switching.</div>
<h2>Reply by Jim (Melbourne)</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-13 4:23</div>
<div class="content">I can't argue with that, Kevin, "too little" is "too little" by any definition.  And yes, if doing almost nothing is simply adopted for the sake of not breaking the rules of the system then it would be pretty useless.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-13 11:35</div>
<div class="content">Kevin:<br><br>Theoretically I agree with you. But practically it doesn't seem to be a problem. What happens is generally one of two things: either the amount of time spent on each session grows and the task gets done successfully; or it withers away and eventually gets dismissed.</div>
<h2>Reply by Christian Gärtner</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-15 6:31</div>
<div class="content">I agree with Mark. I actually made this experience more than once. AF "forces" me to start, but resistance is already lower than it used to be with other systems, since I only have to work a little bit on the item. And than quite often I work 30 min or an hour on it bringing the task/project to the next stage (or even complete it). I think the important aspect is to get things rolling.</div>

<div class="content">I came across a very good exposition of "procrastination" while researching some therapies on cognitive behaviour, in particular how to rationally challenge  avoidance of tasks : <a href="http://markettorrent.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=4786" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markettorrent.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=4786</a><br><br>Procrastination comes from "self-doubts, perfectionism, fear of failure, risk aversion, anxiety, rebellion, depression, or feeling vulnerable. It can start from anticipating or judging that an activity is too complicated, troublesome, fearsome, or boring to do."</div>
