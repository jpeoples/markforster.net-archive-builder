<div class="content">I started using Autofocus on Monday and dismissed / rejected my first task today. Its now highlighted and when I dismissed it I added " review rejected items" as a task to the bottom of my list which is 6 pages further on.<br><br>(I am using a notebook with 34 lines per page)</div>

<div class="content">This part of the system is one of the really excellent things it's got going. And thanks for reminding me about the "review rejected items" task, Helen... Kind of important that one ;)</div>
