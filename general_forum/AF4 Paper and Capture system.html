<div class="content">Just started using AF4 past few days. So far is working great. A question that I have, which is my current item in Open list :-) is in using a paper system for the list, what are the best ways to get stuff captured and added to the list when its not with you?  I've used pda/voice recorder-> email before with GTD.... Trying to avoid using email inbox though as this is the source of big time suck. I have note pads also around house too.  The beauty of the paper based system is it completely avoids any digital/net temptations when working through the list. How are others doing there captures and collects?</div>

<div class="content">I have a business card holder which has a pen and business cards.  I capture my todos on the backs of old business cards.  [new business cards look totally different so no chance of giving them away.]</div>

<div class="content">I carry a small notebook everywhere I go....it is great for capturing things when away from my AF4 notebook.  As part of a daily checklist, I review the notebook in the morning and at the end of the day to make sure things I wish to add to my AF4 list make it there.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">My AF list consists of a stack of index cards, one card per action. The advantages are that the cards can hold additional notes, as things evolve, an I never have to rewrite list entries nor do deleted entries mess up the list. And "remote capturing" is extremely easy because blank cards are dumped everywhere around the house. I just have to grab one, write down my note, and take care that it is somehow carried to the list. No rewriting needed.<br>In the beginning, I experimented with a portable system, but I learned that the AF list can stay at the desk without problems. The important point is that capturing must be possible at any time and at any place, but for me, the list does not need to be with me all the time.</div>

<div class="content">I generally have my list with me (it lives on the desk if I'm at home or work, and in my purse if I'm out and about) but if I don't I use the Notes features of my (dumb) phone to create entries and am in the habit of looking at that and transferring entries when I get back to my list.</div>

<div class="content">I do almost exactly like David.  I handle the list that ends up in my small notebook like an AF list except that the only action is to add the item to the real AF list (Home or Work).  Then it gets crossed off.<br><br>It is a flip up pocket notebook.  The list only ends up on the bottom half.  The top half gets used for things I need to remember or sometimes a shopping list (which really is the same thing.  Once those things are no longer needed, they get crossed off as well.  <br><br>I always have it with me and I no longer worry about forgetting to add something to my AF list.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for the quick replies, I see a few different approaches here that could work for me.  When I'm at home (working or not), I like the index card all over idea, as this is simplest and I had used this before.  When out of home, this is tougher, because I forget everything. Index cards I could maybe remember, but a pen - will get lost the same day for sure... I do bring pda/phone with me always, and can use it for text/voice notes (by the way motorola droid phone is incredible device). I think the missing part is what David said about a daily checklist.  I didnt see this in the AF4 system but it looks like a basic checklist framework would allow for the once or twice a day - beginning being easiest to do the quick things that only take a few minutes to keep the external collection and capture part of the system complete.<br><br>-David P</div>

<div class="content">Daily checklist?  Possible, but things like this I just write in my AF4 list as a TODO.</div>

<div class="content">The usefulness of a daily checklist may depend on the individual and his particular job.  For me, I have to violate the rule that says "don't start your day with email".  If I don't, I am virtually certain to miss a short noticed tasker.  In my job, that will be seen as my fault, not the fault of the sender who waited until the last minute.  I have several other items I need to do first thing daily, so that checklist works for me.  (It's pretty much a habit now, but the checklist in Outlook that regenerates the task for the next day works nicely to make sure.)</div>
