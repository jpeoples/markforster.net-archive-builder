<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">As many of you know, I've been managing first DWM and now SF through Toodledo for something on the order of a year now. Lately, though, I had become a bit disenchanted with the Toodledo web interface - I wanted more drag-and-drop and more quick-add functionality than a web page can provide. (The Toodledo iPad app is brilliant, though.)<br><br>I had heard fabulous things about Appigo's (<a href="http://www.appigo.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.appigo.com/</a> ) ToDo suite - they have mobile apps for iOS and just recently released a Mac desktop client. I tried the iPad app and loved it, so when the desktop version came out I bought it, too (and I don't buy software costing more than $5 lightly). I have to say - I love it. The desktop app gives me both quick add and drag & drop organization. I'm in the process of migrating all of my timed task reminders to ToDo as well (currently they're calendar events). The apps (all of them) also support a wide variety of task types - there are normal tasks, communication tasks (which you can link to address book contacts), project tasks (which take subtasks of normal tasks and communication tasks), and checklist tasks (which take subtasks of just normal tasks). I'm really jazzed about this last feature because it means you could easily embed project lists right into your regular AF/DWM/SF list.<br><br>There are a handful of sync options for these apps:<br>1) Toodledo sync. This is what I'm using now, but I hope to move away from it (more on this in a minute). Syncing is fine, but unless you have a pro account, you can't sync project or checklist tasks (because subtasks aren't supported in free Toodledo).<br>2) ToDo online - their own web-based solution. I haven't tried it so I can't comment either on the syncing or on the web application itself.<br>3) WiFi sync. THEORETICALLY you can pair your mobile device and your desktop and sync via your WiFi network but I haven't managed to even get them to pair yet. <br><br>It's not a perfect solution. I have a wishlist (which I will be sending on to them, of course):<br>1) WiFi syncing needs to be more clear. Both times I've tried to set it up, it hasn't worked, and <br>migrating back to Toodledo sync has been a major headache (requiring a help request the second time). <br>2) Right now the sorting options are rather limited (due time, priority, and alphabetical) but I've put in a request for sorting by time added.<br>3) Right now the only way to sort your lists (for AF/SF purposes, your pages) is alphabetically. I want manual control over that.<br>4) More frequent syncing options on both platforms. Right now on iOS it syncs when you start it up and after that it's manual syncing only. On the dekstop, the most frequent sync setting is every hour. I'd love to at least see sync-on-quit on the desktop and the option of automatic syncing on the mobile end of things.<br><br>Overall, though - $35 well-spent.</div>

<div class="content">Although I have steeled myself never to go the Apple route, I have to say I am envious of the way you aficianados get what seems like very good apps.  That checklist feature sounds good.<br><br>I actually went for Toodledo on my Windows desktop after reading so many comments about it on this forum.  I am still using it and am surprised that it does not have drag and drop in its Apple incarnation at least.  Of course, there's no mobile version except for iOS.<br><br>Last month I got my first proper smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy SII with Android OS.  I then downloaded and bought Ultimate To-Do List which synchronises with Toodledo.  I'm finding it more functional than Toodledo, but still keep Toodledo so I can use it at my standing-height desk (yes, still standing most of the time at the computer!) when I'm using my notebook.<br><br>Android users on this forum should take a look at <a href="http://www.todolist.co/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.todolist.co/</a><br><br>BTW Sarah, there is a trailing ')' at the end of your link which results in a Page Not Found result - we all do it ;-)))))</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br>I loved todo when I initially got my iPhone but haven't looked at it for couple of years. Now they have todo online, I would like to take this for a spin.<br><br>Can you explain your Superfocus setup on todo? How are you segregating your pages, Col2 and moving tasks across them? Thanks.<br><br>PS: Your toodledo implementation really helped me and I took that to checkvist. The latter is really nice except for the mobile access.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">GC, Thanks!<br><br>My setup is virtually identical to my old Toodledo setup. ToDo lets you separate tasks into lists, so I have a separate list for each "page", still with 25 "lines" (which for me translates to 25 C1 items - my C2 never gets anywhere close to full).  Columns are differentiated by priority designation - C1 is low priority, C2 is medium.<br><br>I posted an annotated screen grab of one "page" at <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/SFinToDo.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/SFinToDo.jpg</a></div>
