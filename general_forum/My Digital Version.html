<div class="content">I work from home as a freelance web designer and 90% of my tasks involve my computer.  Although a long-time GTD fan, GTD wasn't cutting it for me when I had 150+ tasks in the @computer category. I've been working out my own method for several weeks now and it is very similar to Autofocus so I feel I should share.<br><br>Several weeks ago, I decided to break up my tasks into contexts that better matched how I blocked out my day.  I spend my mornings working on paid client work and my afternoons handling admin tasks and drawing new characters for my Girls Can't What? business.  I keep all my client tasks in a list called "clients" and my other business tasks in a list called "GCW".  I use these lists in the exact way Mark mentioned, scanning them and picking out the ones that seem intuitively right to focus on.  <br><br>Sometimes I may have a lot of tasks for a specific web site so I made it a habit to add the client name after each task like this for easy searching/filtering:  <br>Install Widget | ABC Company<br><br>I also have a few other lists...<br>Inbox - where I dump things for later sorting. <br>Shopping - stuff to buy at the store<br>Home - stuff to do at home (including non-business computer tasks)<br>Agenda - things to talk to people about either by phone or email.  (if it is a client or business contact it goes on the client or GCW list) <br>Errands - anything outside of "home"<br>Routine - any repeating task no matter what category <br><br>So 7 lists in all.  I use Remember the Milk (www.rememberthemilk.com) and have one tab for each list.  I don't use tags or locations.  Just simple lists. I use the Firefox add-in so I can dump emails into it by starring them in gmail and that also insures I have my list open in front of me all day.  I also have RTM on my iPhone so it's mobile and I can add things on the run.<br><br>I date items when appropriate, but I do not put repeating tasks in my other lists because it defeats the purpose of checking them off only to have them reappear.  The repeating tasks show up on my radar on the appropriate date (in the gmail view) and I am in the habit of either doing or renegotiating them first before picking from the other lists.<br><br>Things like workouts and practices go on my calendar.<br><br>Hopefully this gives the geeky folks some ideas.  :)</div>
