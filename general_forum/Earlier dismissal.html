<div class="content">I understand what "reject" means and when I do it. I have at times items that I am ready to drop. <br>I understand what "dismiss"means and when I do it : you get to those items many times and never jumped on it ; sooo ....<br><br>Yesterday and this morning I got items which my first move was to reject, then found better to immediately dismiss (although I still had items standing out on the page) : "Sure, I am not going to spend time on that this week nor next week". So I highlighted them and added a date (that means : "Don't bother with that before ...", kind of a tickler system).<br>This was applying my "common sense".<br><br>Q : <br>| Is dismissing an item before the page was screened out OK, <br>| or am I at risk doing that, AF speaking ?<br><br>Just to be sure I don't miss something.</div>
