<div class="content">As I haven’t seen anyone else do so (though I might have missed something), I wanted to mention both Things and The Hit List options for implementing DWM electronically. From what I’ve been able to figure out, there’s no way of implementing DWM in OmniFocus so that it runs and smoothly and as easily in either Things or The Hit List. The Hit List is best adapted, it seems to me, mainly because there’s less tabbing involved to add dates to tasks than in Things. Things wins out in two other ways, though: Things handles scheduled tasks (i.e., tasks you don’t want on the list yet, but want to be reminded of at some future point – like my driving licence renewal in a couple of years, say) and repeating tasks in a nicer way than THL, and, notoriously, THL has no iPhone app. (The developer has been claiming that it’s on the way for a long time; there are rather heated debates out there about what to expect, etc.) Not only does Things have a very nice iPhone app, but it’s relatively free of sync problems, unlike OmniFocus’s iPhone app.</div>

<div class="content">Ugh...sorry. Terrible proof-reading this morning. Here’s a corrected version of that:<br><br>As I haven’t seen anyone else do so (though I might have missed something), I wanted to mention both Things and The Hit List (THL) as options for implementing DWM electronically. From what I’ve been able to figure out, there’s no way of implementing DWM in OmniFocus so that it runs and smoothly and as easily as it does in either Things or THL. THL is perhaps best adapted to the core of DWM, as there’s less tabbing involved to add dates to tasks than is needed in Things. Things has advantages in certain other respects, though: it handles scheduled tasks (i.e., tasks you don’t want on the list yet, but want to be reminded of at some future point – like my driving licence renewal in a couple of years, say) and repeating tasks in a nicer way than THL; and, notoriously, THL has no iPhone app. (The developer has been claiming that it’s on the way for a long time; there are rather heated debates out there about what to expect, how upset to be, etc.) Not only does Things have a very nice iPhone app, but it’s relatively free of sync problems, unlike the OmniFocus iPhone app.</div>

<div class="content">Looking up Things on the iPhone, it seems nice.  I also happened to find Put Things Off, which just happens to be a loose approximation of a DWM app: It shows you thing you can do, and you can either do them or postpone them.  Of course following DWM, you'd have to do a bit of work first and then postpone, but the app doesn't need to care about that.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan:<br><br>Yes, Put Things Off is very nice as far as it goes. It does (quite deliberately) do a lot less, though. It’s iPhone only, for one thing (at the moment). It doesn’t handle repeating tasks, or have a special place for notes. And, perhaps most signficantly for DWM, it’s a much more cumbersome process than in THL or (the desktop version of) Things to assign dates in PTO. (You can set a default amount of time to put things off by in PTO, but in DWM one is going to be constantly switching between dating things for a week from now, and a month from now, and switching from one to the other in PTO is not quick.) Of course, any of this could change when the developer brings out PTO 2.0.</div>

<div class="content">Martin, could you go into more detail about how you are using Things with DWM?</div>

<div class="content">Haven't had a single problem with Omnifocus syncing, so I'm not sure what Martin is referring to.<br><br>My DWM set up is as simple as can be using Omnifocus - again, I don't understand what the problem is.<br><br>Here are the basic elements of my set up:<br><br>- I use a single context for all my active tasks<br><br>- This context is set up to show only active tasks<br><br>- Tasks are automatically sorted by due (expiry) date<br><br>- Expired tasks are moved (dumped) to a project labelled "Expired". (NB. this project's status is set to "Dropped" so that these tasks don't appear in the active task list.<br><br>- I follow Mark's instructions or cycling through the list.<br><br>Not sure how Things does this any more elegantly.</div>
