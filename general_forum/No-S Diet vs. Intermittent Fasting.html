<div class="content">After a long failed trial of intermittent fasting, I'm getting ready to try the No-S diet.  Just replied to those old blog posts –<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/10/19/no-s-diet-update.html#comment20880104" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/10/19/no-s-diet-update.html#comment20880104</a><br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2012/10/15/and-now-for-something-completely-different.html#comment20880101" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2012/10/15/and-now-for-something-completely-different.html#comment20880101</a><br><br>– but I imagine most folks won't see those updates.<br><br>Has anyone here stuck with No-S?</div>

<div class="content">I've stuck with No S for a few months now, and I've done it before. It works very well for me and I'm steadily losing weight.</div>

<div class="content">I think the key to using No-S is to relax your expectations about how quickly you'll lose weight. I read somewhere (I'll post if I find it) research that said losing about a half-pound a week is pretty normal, so adjust your timetable to that. Enjoy the process and see it as one of the most low-impact ways you can affect your eating habits. <br><br>I use a mix of intermittent fasting and No-S and that's what works best for me. Like Dr. Johnson, abstinence comes easier to me than temperance.  <br><br>A co-worker is doing an intermittent fast where he only eats during an 8-hr window, like from noon to 8pm, and fasts the rest of the time. He finds it easy to accommodate with his family's eating times and has lost 15+ lbs. since December. Slow and steady wins the race.</div>

<div class="content">I actually read the transcript of all the Everyday Systems podcasts and read a few forum entries.<br><br>You're right, no-S is about relaxing your expectations, and setting up good habits. If you're not in the habit of snacking on N days, then you don't mindlessly wander over on S days. If you're not in the habit of having seconds on N days, then you won't automatically reach for seconds of Aunt Mary's mashed potatoes with sour cream. Even if you do, you'll probably take less.<br><br>New dieters should count calories for a week. That's enough to learn all their common foods and favourite treats. It's also a reality check. A tablespoon of cream in my tea every day was small change compared to my other habits.<br><br>A small Turtle Blizzard is 700 calories -- that's 1/5 of a pound in the wrong direction every mall trip. A single whole wheat bagel with cream cheese, a single slice of bacon and 8oz of orange juice for breakfast? Equally bad. A handful of peanuts for a snack? 1/10 of a pound.<br><br>I don't use calories to restrict my diet. It turns out I need a solid breakfast and mid-afternoon snack. And I don't look up every item. I've looked up enough to have a good-enough feel. It's also not the whole story. Timing and composition and what you eat together have a big effect.<br><br>It did help me find the high-calorie habits that are easy to cut out or replace with something better. I was going up a pound a month (it was a stressful fall). Now, with no-S and calorie awareness, I no longer have a Blizzard when I go to the mall alone. It's absolutely worth 350 calories for a small so we can sit down as a family and recover after clothes shopping. I'm now going down a pound every few weeks and not feeling deprived. I'm only 15 pounds over target, so that's fast enough, and doesn't risk rebound.</div>
