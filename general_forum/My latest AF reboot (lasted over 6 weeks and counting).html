<div class="content">I've fairly certain I'm not the only person to have started AF more then once.  However I thought you might be interested in hearing about the "reboot" of the system which is still working.<br><br>First time round, I started with my old GTD Next Actions list.  Didn't work.<br><br>Then I wrote out a long(ish) list of all the things I could think of which ought to be done.  I started with about 150 items, and followed the normal instructions.  Lasted about a month, and it was reasonably effective, but it resulted in a number of  high resistance items near the start.<br><br>So I restarted again.  With a blank sheet of paper, and a separate list of things to do that day.  I worked mainly from the day's to-do list.  However whenever I did something that was unfinished, I added the item to the AF list.  So at the end of the day, the only things on the AF list were the things I had taken action on.  The second day was similar: everything on the AF list was something I had actively worked on.<br><br>New items I hadn't actioned were added to the end of the old AF list - as it was a handy place to add them: any project-type list would have done.<br><br>After a few days, I started to add items as they came up to the AF list, ones I had not yet taken any action on<br><br>I should point out that the list did have backlog items, but only ones where I had taken some small action.  I am fairly certain that this is why the list was working: there was some small momentum to everything on the list, even if it was only creeping along.<br><br>The other relevant factor is that I did have a backlog list, my old AF list: I think having someone where these things was captured is very important.  <br><br>One thing that is missing is a "someday/maybe" type list, for putting all projects I am deliberately not working on yet.</div>

<div class="content">Penny:<br><br>This is a good illustration of the fact that dumping tasks into your AF list doesn't work, particularly for a beginner. It's much better, as I keep on advising, to let your list grow by starting with a few obvious tasks, like "Email", "Tidy Desk", etc, and then adding further things to the end of the list as you think of them or as they come up.<br><br>This works very well because if you haven't thought of something after a week or two and no one else has raised it either, it's likely to be pretty dead anyway.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>That was partly why I posted!  <br><br>Letting the list grow like this is almost the opposite of every other time management system, most of which seem to start by telling you to write a list of everything you need to do first.  <br><br>The system is still working well for me - thank you for publishing it.<br><br>Penny</div>
