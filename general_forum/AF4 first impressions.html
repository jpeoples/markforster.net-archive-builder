<div class="content">Hi everybody,<br><br>Just wanted to share my first impressions of AF4:<br><br>Mark, I think the idea is brilliantly simple and this might very well be the 'final' Autofocus system!! I love the idea that the closed list idea is used but still allowing the freedom for the 'now' stuff to be done as well. It really makes sense...<br><br>The fact that my whole list (269 items) is now a closed list is very inspiring. On the first run I already managed to identify 34 items that weren't relavant anymore / double entries / already had been done. This shows how in AF3 I had been ignoring a large section of the list. This cleanup feels great. 'Only' 235 items left...<br><br>As with every system the proof of the pudding is in the eating (for a few weeks/months)... but at this moment things look very promising!!<br><br>I think the system is very much comparable to DIT. The difference is that you don't have a closed list for each day but for as long as it takes. This makes the system much more flexible than DIT. For me the problem with DIT was that I have some days with a lot of discretionary time and also days wth hardly any discretinary time. I remember having thoughts that (kind of) resemble AF4 when I was trying DIT a year ago. Though I never implemented it...<br><br>What are the first impressions of the rest of the 'Autofocus Community'?</div>

<div class="content">I've started AF4 yesterday, and so far it works fine but I'm having mixed feelings, I'm not sure how I feel about the new dismissal rule.  My problem with AF2/RAF was that dismissal was too slow, to much old stuff hanging around and not enough incentive to work on the beginning of the list.  AF4 definitely will help to work more on the beginning of the list, not sure about the dismissal yet.  I'll have to wait until I've experienced dismissal (sometime this week maybe?) to see if I really like AF4 better than previous versions.<br><br>Another point: what I liked about DIT was that it helped me define what "a day's work" looked like. I have the impression that AF4 will do that too, but on a somewhat larger timescale, depending on how often you move the closed-list line. Any thoughts on that?</div>

<div class="content">Cruisader,<br><br>You are the first person in YEARS who has not said/written: "The Proof is in the Pudding"!  LOL ;-)<br><br>But yes, I agree with what you are saying.  The thing is that the system is so damn SIMPLE.  I'm running an experiment now where I rewrote my list in a new book just for this test.  At the moment I'm at almost 125 items.  29 on the closed list and the rest on the open list (I've been adding since I started, of course).  I did not start with the entire old list as closed, but rather drew a line where it seemed to make sense.  I'm sure that I will have a dismissal today as I know some of the items on the closed list can't be done today.  So I'll dismiss and re-add.  I'm already feeling just a twinge of anxiety about that, but I know it does not matter because I can keep the items and get back to them on Tuesday (Monday is a holiday here).<br><br>Well, back to work.<br><add to list: "Get Sticky Pudding off of my Proof"></div>

<div class="content">I started into AF4 yesterday by continuing with my large RAF list (36 active pages... sigh!). I don't want to wait until on 36 pages, nothing stands out, so I cut my list into 3 chunks, and I suspect the first chunk will be dismissed these days... So, running with 3 backlogs in the moment, it ratters and creeks, but anyway, it works far more better. I've come across areas of my list I haven't been for weeks...!<br><br>Might very well be that AF4 is the final solution.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, but we all know that it never ends.  A thousand years from now people will still be tweaking systems.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">"Might very well be that AF4 is the final solution"<br><br>Anyone want to wager that this system won't survive hacks, and possibly a brand new system, by October? Takers?</div>

<div class="content">>>"AF4 is the final solution"<br><br>Sounds creepy!<<<br><br>Oops. I wasn't aware of *that* meaning... <br><br>I simply meant "AF4 is it, yeah! We may stop thinking about task management systems now and start achieving our goals!"<br><br>But we all LIKE thinking about task management systems so much, don't we?</div>

<div class="content">I know I sound like a grumpy old man, but I've lost the enthusiasm (maybe after AF 1) , that a new system will serve all my needs, at every-time.</div>

<div class="content">I've come to the conclusion that no system will serve perfectly at all times. But, for me, ANY system is better than NO system. And the iterations of AF have been the only thing I've stuck with for more than a few weeks.</div>

<div class="content">I cannot assess AF4 yet (just started), but so far with every version of AF I was more productive than ever before. Thus I'm looking forward how AF4 works for me...<br><br>However: Thank you Mark for putting so much effort into the development of AF1-AFn (n=4 as of today ;-) )<br><br>Regards<br>Christian</div>

<div class="content">Hi MIke,<br><br>I just googled 'The proof is in the pudding' and only just found out this expression has been shortened!! Now you mention it it rings a bell I must say...<br><br>I'm Dutch and always lived in the Netherlands but my mother is English and she uses this expression a lot :-) I don't think she still uses the old version too!<br><br>When did the expression change?<br><br>Good luck getting the pudding off your proof! :-D lol<br></div>

<div class="content">The simple cunning of AF4 (after all of one day using it) is that it forces you to keep squeezing the 'backlog', bit by bit, and to focus on MAKING DECISIONS about the things you've been dilly-dallying on for too long...AND it allows the flexibility to get to the end fast when you need to.<br>The genius of AF1, which was masked for me in AF2 and AF3 was the introduction of a delay between idea and action.  For someone as impulsive as me the delay is essential.<br>AF4 manages the tension that (i) you want to keep picking at the backlog so that you don't have to make a decision about every single thing in it (ii) you want to get to the end for all those juicy things that are out of bounds as long as you're at the backlog.<br>Because it greatly limits the time you can spend on the active list, I'm finding myself enjoying wrestling with these tensions and working in a little and often approach much more effectively.<br>Thank you Mark.  I'm not waiting for AF5.  I'm a happy customer (not a paying customer yet, but I'd be glad for that to change when you want it to).</div>

<div class="content">Cruisader:<br><br><< I just googled 'The proof is in the pudding' and only just found out this expression has been shortened!! >><br><br>Well, I am English and I've never heard of the expression "The proof is in the pudding". It's always been "The proof of the pudding is in the eating".<br><br>I've sometimes heard it abbreviated "The proof of the pudding..." but then the rest of the expression is understood.</div>

<div class="content">Ben:<br><br><< I'm not waiting for AF5. >><br><br>No, neither am I. I need this to be the final version so that hopefully I can now get on with spreading the word, and even (ahem!) making some money out of it.</div>

<div class="content">Crusader, Mark,<br><br>Yes, that is a horrible corruption among the illiterai here in the U.S.    They simply don't know what the phrase means or how it might have come about.  People simply don't think about things.  They just parrot half-heard phrases as if they understood them.  Just an awful state of affairs.  I mentioned it because I seldom (almost NEVER) hear it stated properly.  Leave it to a non-native speaker to get it right!!!!  (Most likely the English take care about words more than we do here.)<br><br>Y'all (Southern U.S. idiom there ;-) need to see "Idiocracy".  Funny movie but so damn on the mark.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Reminds me of the expression "to go through it with a fine tooth comb". As I child I always wondered what a toothcomb was. I think I was about 18 before the penny dropped*!<br><br>I've put "Idiocracy" on my Lovefilm list.<br><br>* do you use that expression in the States?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-7 12:15</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Comb:  ROTF ;-)  Yes we use that here as well.  That reminds me of a thing that Art Linkletter did on his TV show some long years back.  I think it was called something like "Kids Say the Darndest Things"  Around Xmas time he had the kids sing Christmas carols and then stopped them at key points to question the lyrics they were singing.  They were saying things like "Round John Virgin, Mother and Child"  ROTF ;-)<br><br>Jay Leno does a segment he calls "Headlines".  Some things that people write are too funny: "Fine house on a cold-a-sack."<br><br>I keep wanting to make a master list of all of the half-heard not understood words and phrases people use.  I never get around to it.  Maybe it should go on the AF4 list?</div>
