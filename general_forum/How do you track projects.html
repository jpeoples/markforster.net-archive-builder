<div class="content">In GTD it's easy - you keep a project list not to forget any key project you want/need to move forward. With AF I could forget sometime to put the next thing on the project into the list. Is it a discipline issue or Mark uses project list as well?</div>

<div class="content">Eugene,<br><br>Way back with AF1, Mark stressed the importance of rewriting the item on the bottom of the list if you are going to need to do it again or if it's an ongoing project. <br><br>If you "forget" to add the item again to the list, you won't trust your list, and the system is no longer a system. It fails.<br><br>So, I err on the side of rewriting items on the bottom of the list. If I didn't really need to, no harm done. I can always cross it off. If I needed to, but didn't. That good be a big problem. <br><br>Conclusion: I learned early on that AF only works if I develop the habit of rewriting items that recur, or are ongoing projects, at the bottom of the list, even as I am still working on them in the middle of the list.<br><br>What I do when I've selected a line on my AF list to work on, is to put a dot next to the item that I am currently working on. That way, if I get interrupted and lose my place, I just glance at my list and I am reminded to return to the current item. <br><br>If I have an item that recurs or is part of an ongoing project, IMMEDIATELY AFTER WRITING THE DOT, I rewrite the item or project name at the bottom of my list.<br><br>Regarding project lists, what I have found, and I think many here have had similar experiences, is that I do not need to maintain a project list for most of the stuff that is on my AF list. A lot of stuff is self-evident. <br><br>But I do have a fair number of multi-item projects that I do anticipate will stretch out over many weeks, or longer. I tend to create project plans for the kinds of projects that have many items that stretch out over longer periods of time. Here, the tasks required are often self-evident, but I tend to lose track of what I have done when I am only doing small tasks spaced out over long periods of time.<br><br>I always write either the project name or the next task at the bottom of my AF list. I might not need or be able to work the next task for 2 more weeks, but this serves as a reminder that the project is still ongoing.</div>
