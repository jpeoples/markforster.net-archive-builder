<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Today I lost my paper organizer.  I was walking back to the car from the grocery when I noticed that my notebook was not with me.  I came back to the places where I was before, thinking that I left it somewhere, but I never found it.  I asked some of the employees there but no one seemed to have noticed nor had anyone returned it.  I however had to leave because the groceries were needed, so I just went back home, hoping that somebody turned it in.<br><br>I drove back in a daze.  The thing is, there was nothing much of monetary worth there, but all of my plans, all of my projects were there.  I have my old organizer notes in my room but they were scattered and unorganized, and most of them are outdated.  However, what was I to do? I lost my AF notebook. Deal with it, I told myself.<br><br>I was not able to do much this evening, I just did my chores.  After all of them were done, I looked for the grocery's phone number and called them.  Drats, no one turned in the notebook.  Oh well, I said to myself, it's gone.  I was ruminating in my head whether I should be buying a new one when I opened my email. <br><br>And lo and behold! Somebody emailed me about my organizer! I called the number and I was able to talk to the finder of my notebook.  She said she found it in a part of the store I never went to.  I assume that somebody stole the notebook from me (it looks dignified and expensive looking, you know) thinking it had money inside, but finding nothing of worth there just left it where my savior found it.  Anyways, we set up a meeting tomorrow morning for me to pick it up.<br><br>Notwithstanding the hopefully happy ending to my adventure tomorrow morning, it got me wondering whether this notebook has practically made it a crutch for me to live life, as Erik Loraine said in one of his videos.  It disturbs me that losing a notebook with little monetary value could potentially bring someone's plans to such potential chaos, and wondering the wisdom of it all.<br><br>Or maybe I shouldn't have brought it in the grocery.<br><br>Or maybe I shouldn't have bought such a beautiful notebook.<br><br>I dunno.<br><br>If only it is not so hard to back-up a paper notebook like we could a smartphone, PDA or laptop.  Ahh well.<br><br>Sorry for the rant.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">I've had PDAs break and no good PC software so my plans were gone. I've temporarily lost  my paper notes so now I try to abide by a simple rule: it's only allowed in my house, car, or office. Ever.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I honestly think it's a sign of a crutch.<br>But there are ways to still use it and "de-crutch" yourself.<br>I mean, I still use clocks ;)<br><br>By the way, this is a very big aside but I'm starting to use my system less and less. I actually see the flow of what I do in a day in my head and can balance it now as if I where right in front of my notebook. Before, I couldn't help myself and worked like crazy on stuff. Now, I have learned to observe myself more and use my energies with better balance.<br><br>My system is a crutch for me but getting rid of it is just a good sign I believe!</div>

<div class="content">Personally, I don't see what's wrong with having a crutch, or several crutches. They are means by which one can confidently deal with the myriad of things that command our attention everyday. Autofocus is a big crutch for me, and I hope to make it a bigger one as time goes by.<br><br>I can see the value of having a good backup plan though!</div>

<div class="content">Crutch?  When there's 25 things (not counting routine things) I must remember to do this week, how can I not have a system?  It's like deciding not to use an airport luggage cart.  Easy only if you don't have much luggage.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, I should have been more explicit.<br><br>As I said in the video, if you actually need a crutch, then by all means I believe you should use it. I mean if you break a leg and don't use a crutch, you won't go far.<br><br>On the other side if you don't have a broken leg and use a crutch, then you are effectively crippling yourself. Good use of habits tend to highlight some things that can be treated as crutches from then on.<br><br>One could of course argue that since habits are a kind of crutch, that it's just the same thing but only changing shape. I tend to believe that it's the fundamental way that human being gets orguanized and it has been like that starting from our prehistoric past. We are geared towards it and I feel it more as a natural state then a crutch.<br><br>Only my 2 cents ;)</div>

<div class="content">I am sorry for your near-loss and sympathetic to your anxiety.<br><br>It would be difficult to lose my organizer (to-do list). First of all, because all hard deadlines and appointments are on my calendar, not my to do list. And my calendar is on my computer, backed up regularly, also synced to Mobile Me and also synced to my iPhone, which is also backed up regularly.<br><br>If I did lose my list, I just sit down and recreate it. Anything important would get on the list. And starting again from scratch has its own benefits. :-)<br><br>All that said, this is one of the reasons I use a digital to do list (a very simple application of AutoFocus, using Omnifocus on my computer) which backed up, synced, etc.</div>

<div class="content">I always scare to loose mine. Its includes everythings notes, tasks, ideas, plans objectives even if others infos are on my computer. It is quiet huge (it is a A4notebook).<br>Loosing it could be a disaster for me. Anyway, I plan to buy an ipad because my life becomes so complicated with so many informations about everything that a paper tool is very light for me (even if i prefer it).</div>

<div class="content">This sounds as if it could have been one of those situations where you draw on the goodwill you created by having such good systems in the first place, like when you fry your hard drive at work and the company backup recovery fails.<br><br>1. dump everything you can recall on a new list, and keep it handy to add things as they occur<br>2. contact your contacts, tell them what has happened and ask for their patience. Share what you  are working on for them and ask if they need anything else.<br><br>Which leads to a useful question: "have I built up the goodwill I would need if MY system were to go down?". Hmm.</div>

<div class="content">Every time you enter a new page in your notebook, make a photocopy of the just-completed page. So, in the worst case you'll only lose the tasks you've written down since the last photocopy. And, since those will be the most recently written, it will be easier to recreate. This will probably keep your losses to a minimum.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Thank you guys for the discussion; reading them, though not particularly geared to relieving some of the shock I had (except for Liz I's, of course, and for that I am very very thankful), DID give me some relief.<br><br>Anyways the morning the next day I got the organizer, and fortunately nothing was missing (which I had expected, since there was nothing of monetary value in it), and since then (yesterday) I had used it with more vigor than ever before.<br><br>I guess it was a blessing in disguise, to let me know how much a source of good it can be, so I should use my notebook more thoroughly yet carefully.<br><br>Anyways about the discussion:<br><br>@Erik, Alan, and JD,<br><br>Once my head starting clearing up, I realized that this organizer is a crutch I DO need, as without it I can become very disorganized and would be forgetting things left and right.  So thanks for the discussion, that gave me more confidence in using my notebook.<br><br>@Alan,<br><br>I think I am going to follow your example.  I have no adequate way of back-upping my notebook, so I guess I have to just not bring it to somewhere I can lose it.<br><br>@Will,<br><br>Exactly.  Scary, huh?<br><br>@Jupiter, <br><br>I do hope your coming ipad will help you.<br><br>@Matt,<br><br>Well, I do not have a photocopying machine, and I do not have the money or time to photocopy again and again, so I guess I'd stick with Alan's example and just be more careful with it.<br><br>God bless, and thanks to all!</div>

<div class="content">I felt the exact same way a few years ago when my computer that held my organization at the time crashed and then a day later a major storm blew through and knocked out the power.  (I had bits of it stored online so was able to get some of it back eventually.)  But for the time without it, It made a big believer in the power of the handwritten!  I had also thought of a similar event like what happened to you happening to the notebook I had now.  <br><br>I too made the same decision.  It doesn't go anywhere where it might get lost.  It stays in the messenger bag or at home. That's it.  For "out and about" I have a small cheap notebook that I scribble things in and if there is a shopping list, etc, I just transcribe it into the "handheld." ;)<br><br>Here's a good link for making your own little booklet, origami style! <a href="http://www.makingbooks.com/hotdog.shtml" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.makingbooks.com/hotdog.shtml</a><br><br>For things of "Great Import", I make sure to have them backed up online somewhere.  I use Evernote because I can just take pics of them and store them in the proper folder  but there are tons of options.</div>

<div class="content">A camera is an excellent backup system for paper. Easier than photocopying. <br>I'm with you on the short travel list idea. I keep a page called Out which receives things I'll do when I go out. Saves lugging and/or losing the book.</div>

<div class="content">That must have been awful! I felt that way when learning to use a PDA, and again when it started to die, even though one of the benefits of a PDA is how easy it is to make a backup on the computer.<br><br>I lost my purse notebook one time at an office. I must have been talking rather than paying attention. Fortunately they called me the next day. Normally I treat that book the way I treat my wallet -- in my hand or in my purse. Not even in my shopping bag -- my purse.<br><br>My other lists and notes live on my desk. If I need something from them while out, I make a copy.<br><br>The only exceptions are the shopping lists, which lives on the fridge (we add to it as we get low on anything) until one of us goes shopping. I have one list for the grocery store (which I go to frequently) and one for all other stores. When I combined them, every week I had to copy the non-grocery items to the next list.<br><br>Yes, lists can become crutches, but I prefer to think of them as baskets. GTD has it right -- you let the list hold thoughts for you so you can concentrate on what's in front of you.<br><br>I can recreate them well enough if I have to, but it's easier to do it right once.</div>

<div class="content">Losing a DIT/AF list or notebook or organiser is painful, but it is surprising how quickly you recover, rebuilding a new list over a few days and weeks.</div>
