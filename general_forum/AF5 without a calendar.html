<div class="content">Personally I've never had much success with calendars.  One reason I was drawn to AF was the idea of a single list spanning multiple pages of everything that needed to be done.  With AF, one of the few problems that I've had is convincing myself to dismiss old tasks that haven't been completed. <br><br>I'm going to try a variation of AF5.  Continue keeping a single list instead of putting tasks on a calendar.  At the top of every new page I already record the date when the page was started.  At the start of the day when I review tasks I will dismiss any remaining tasks on a page that was started more than 1 month ago.  This will effectively cause any tasks over 30 days to expire automatically but will not require a calendar.<br><br>If I find that 30 days is too short (or too long) then I can change it to 45 days or 2 months or whatever.  I think 1 month will be a good place to start.<br><br>The one feature that I will lose is the 7-day deferal of re-entered tasks.  That's okay with me.  Continuing to work on a task that has been started is not usually a problem for me.  I will continue to re-enter tasks that have been started and not yet completed.  They will effectively have a 30 day exipiration instead of 7 day expiration.<br><br>Since I start a new page about once a week I will usually have about 4 active pages.  I will also have a few days of warning as I approach the 1 month expiration on the oldest page to encourage me to start work on tasks that I've been procrastinating.  <br><br>This, to me, seems simpler and I get to continue working with my single list instead of a calendar.</div>
