<div class="content">I can't get this out of my head, the challenge to not use a list.  But how do I keep on top of things that need to be done but which I forget to do?  I need more advice than "put stuff in a calendar" to feel confident about this.</div>

<div class="content">Mark has already committed to a blog post to explain how you can use reminders and schedules to stay organized. Just sit tight!</div>

<div class="content">I don't know what Mark is going to say about the matter, but I've found that being on top of my work and clearing my commitments to ensure that I can stay on top of my work sure makes a difference.</div>

<div class="content">I think I'm going to reconsider the conditions of the Challenge, so that so that entrants can use whatever method they like with the Question (What am I resisting not doing?). After all the idea is to find out what works best for people in general, not to confirm what works best for me!</div>
