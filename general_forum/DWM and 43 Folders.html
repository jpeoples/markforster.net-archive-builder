<div class="content">I've been using both these systems for several months at least, and it was only today that it clicked how congruent they are. So from now, instead of having lines with the calendar dates, I am using dividing lines marked 1 through 31 corresponding to the card dividers in a 43 folders system. For example today, in 43 folders,  I moved the 1 divider behind the 31 divider having dealt with the days papers, while in my DWM file, after deleting the tasks which dropped off today, I dragged the 1 dividing line down below the 31 line.<br><br>To work this way, you need to be using the original DWM system, in a computer file, and using  the 43 Folders tickler/filing system.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence, in DWM you're constantly cycling through the whole list. Do you do the same with your 43 folders - rather than dealing with each folder's contents on the day they fall due?</div>

<div class="content">@Chris: No, in 43 folders I am just dealing with the new day's papers, which e.g. for tomorrow are inserted between A4 cards labelled 3 (currently at the front) and 4. Those papers are like the tasks in the current day in DWM - tomorrow morning they will be either acted on or discarded. The card labelled 3 will then get moved to the back behind the card labelled 2. Rather than the traditional filing cabinet drawer with folders, I'm using a transparent container.</div>
