<div class="content">In a previous thread, I mentioned this podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/oliverburkeman/<br><br>The interviewee - Oliver Burkeman - is a well known journalist and author. His most recent book is titled: "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals"<br><br>Anyway, in the above podcast @ the 1:24:45 mark, he recommends using two lists (open and closed) and feeding the open list with 5 tasks. UH HELLO... I think I know another Brit who suggests that very technique. <br><br>C'mon Burkeman, a bit of credit to the original would have been nice, no?</div>

<div class="content">To be fair, Burkeman has written plenty of nice things about me over the years.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>He seems like a lovely guy. However I never heard of closed/open lists until I read your work. Dr Peter Attia has a **huge** following - so it's shame the listeners won't discover all of your other gems.</div>

<div class="content">I think Burkeman has written directly of the 5/2 method when he reviewed SoPP on his blog a while back. <br><br>In the 4000 Weeks book, Burkeman I think highlights the Personal Kanban method as the quintessential closed/open list method that most people are familiar with vs. Mark's methods. <br><br>So, I also think it would have been nice to put a few more citations for Mark, but to be somewhat gracious to Burkeman, he was referring to a wide phenomenon of WIP limiting systems, of which Mark's are one (rather large) set.</div>

<div class="content">I found this book in the bookstore yesterday.  I looked in the index and there are no references listed there to Mark Forster.  However, I did notice that there was a reference to the book Personal Kanban, and the book mentioned the method of having no more than 3 things you are working on at a time, limiting the amount of work, and when you finished with two replacing them.</div>
