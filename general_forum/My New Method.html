<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">In an effort to try something new I have reduced my system to a new tool.  I realized that 90% of all of my tasks are done at the office including most of the important personal things like taxes, bill paying etc. <br><br>I now am using as my main "tool" a 17 X 22 inch blank desk pad.  I was able to get everything I need to do and am tracking on less than the first sheet of it.  It is a nice feeling to look at one place and see everything that needs to be done in one place and cross out completed tasks. <br><br>If I am someplace else and something comes up, I just use any notepad I have and transfer when I get back to the office.<br><br>I combined this with trying to generally keep my office cleaner and file notes using a simple A to Z filing system.  I will report back after 30 days of using this.<br><br>Gerry</div>
