<div class="content">I've started on DWM, using 28 index cards because I want  something I can write on (nonelectronic) and keep in my pocket. I write small, and can get 3 or 4 columns of 10 rows on each card, which will probably be enough for most days. The unruled backs of the cards are also available.<br><br>It occurred to me that carrying two thin monthly page-a-day pocket diaries might be a much better way to go. Do such things exist? I bought a few Field Notes (fieldnotesbrand.com) booklets, which worked nicely for AF4, and which would work with hand-entered dates for DWM, although they are 48 pages each. And using up a page each day would be a bit pricy - US $25 to $40 for the year, depending on whether I choose to "waste" the unused pages at the end of each month or just consider each booklet to be 48 days.<br><br>What does everyone think?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Sabrina! The Moleskine color-a-month planners look perfect. I'm going to try to find a (physical) store that carries them, to see how thick two of them feel in my pocket.</div>

<div class="content">Sigh. Couldn't find a local store with the color-a-month planners (probably easier to find in Dec-Jan), and it costs about US $45 to order the set online. They look a bit thick, so I've decided to go with the Field Notes 48-page graph-paper booklets for now (hand-dated). Easier to manage than index cards, and more room to write.</div>
