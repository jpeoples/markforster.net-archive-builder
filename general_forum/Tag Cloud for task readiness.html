<div class="content">(See the new tag cloud on the right.)<br><br>Top of the list = bright, bold, large = important, urgent, active, current, etc.<br><br>Further down = getting stale, ready for dismissal, ready to drop/delete<br><br>Sometimes I've wished OneNote could colorize my tasks, pages, and projects like this, using criteria based on (1) when it was last actioned, or (2) tickler date.</div>

<div class="content">What a brilliant idea!  I'm sure someone could come up with a way to do this!</div>

<div class="content">When it was last actioned == what section it's on.  Tickler dates I have typed in front of the item on the tickler tab, and the items are sorted by date.  So I see little use for coloring.  Sometimes I will indent a note just to change it's shade.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Well, it's easy enough to move your current project page to the top (or folder to the left) in OneNote and make a rule that you work from the top or left. (or bottom or right). This will self organise in exactly the way recommended by Mark for general working filing.<br><br>Nice idea: I think I'll try it. Thank you.</div>
