<div class="content">I am working on superfocus before Superfocus V3 will be released<br><br>I am not sure I understood the method.<br>So I summarized it with my word and give it a try. <br><br>Let's summarize the method : <br><br>1. Make a long list on the first left column.<br>I understand this is my general list. Each new task is reported one by one like on AF1. It can be a very long list. <br>Here will go every new task I think about and every task reformulated if they are unfinished except if they are urgent.<br>Here will also go the unfinished tasks as they are reformulated if they are not urgent. <br><br>2. If there is an urgent task new or reformulated from this first lefts column it goes on a second right column on the same page.<br>Here I will have a list of urgent or important task, I must do as soon as possible. <br><br>I decide this" as soon as possible" is from today to within a week. Am I right ? <br>These urgent or must do task "asap" are either coming from the left column nor brand new task I feel necessary to do asap.<br><br>3. Methodology. <br><br>I treat the all AF page, per page, on my note book. <br><br>First  step :<br>Read the first left column like on AF1 ie first without any intention to to it from the beginning to the end <br>Then second reading as far as one task stand at me and do it during the time I feel doing it. <br><br>Then if it is finished cross it (if to task are crossed make a parenthesis in from and join it then it will be easy to see what is done or not)<br>And If it is unfinished just cross it, do the same but, report it or reformulate it, on the first column if it is a normal or unfinished task and on the right column if it is urgent. <br><br>Second step :<br>When nothing stand at me on the left column just goto the right column and do the same as the first step but on the right column<br>The I will report the task on the left column if they are normal but they will stay on the right column if they are urgent. <br>Do the same parenthesis on the right column as did on the left one. <br><br>Then when the page is over goto the following page. First page is over or on the way of dismissing.<br><br>But how to treat the recurring tasks ? <br>For the recurring tasks it's the same if they are urgent they go on the right column<br>If they are not urgent they go on the left column <br>(I still mean by urgent something I must do during the day or the week)  <br><br>4 Dismiss<br>If nothing stand at me after some reading then the task is dismiss and high lined (I use a yellow high-liner)<br>Then I will decide to put it on my diary for a future treatment or I will cross it as un useful ou because i just decide not to do it. <br><br>Do I understand rightly the Superfocus method ? <br><br>Mark, without teasing you to ask for superfocus vs3 will my list will stay operational for the new version or will it be old fashion and will it need to be completely rewritten ?</div>

<div class="content">Good luck with this.  I'm almost certain this is not what Mark is up to. I doubt anyone else would successfully guess either.  People tried this game with DWM, and completely missed the mark. Mark is meanwhile holding his cards tight to his chest. I think I glimsed 3 spades, but the other 10 are complete mystery.  I think he's right to do this. Releasing rules prematurely and constantly tweaking them is a recipe for chaos, and not really helpful, compared to offering a well tuned ruleset that works smoothly. <br><br>Try your version for a week and report whether it survives unchanged.</div>
