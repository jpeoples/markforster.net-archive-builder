<div class="content">Hey folks. A few months ago, I moved everything from Evernote to Apple Notes. Recently, I've set up a few smart folders in Apple Notes to implement a few elements from Mark's DWM system. It's working really, really well. However I've been infected with Mark-Forster-iritis and always looking to to improve, refine, etc the rules and workflow.   <br><br>If you're knee-deep in the Apple ecosystem (especially Apple Notes), and are interested in any of the above. I'd be glad to explain (here or via Zoom) the workflow. In exchange for a bit of coaching, you'll provide me with suggestions on how to improve this system. <br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Not in Apple Notes, but I understand this -itis.  If it doesn't flow absolutely smoothly, it doesn't flow at all.</div>

<div class="content">Alan - I might have a different itis variant ;)<br><br>Whenever I’m trying a system, my own or someone else’s, if I can make it past a few days I usually have found something that works. So far my set up is working well. My “itis” has to do with an itchiness that it can be improved.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>You are aware that Apple Notes supports hashtags? You could include full body notes in the system and hashtag them for quick access as, uhm, notes.</div>
