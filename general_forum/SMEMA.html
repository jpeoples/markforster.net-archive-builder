<div class="content">Hi, it's a good few months since I've looked in on this site. I wonder, is anyone still using SMEMA? I do, and have to say of all Mark's methods I've tried through the years, it's the one that continues to serve me best. I love its really simple algorithm and seldom feel any great resistance when utilizing this method. Any others still using SMEMA?</div>

<div class="content">Now you've got me wondering how to combine SMEMA with a randomizer!</div>

<div class="content">I have been using SMEMA since it came out and haven't been tempted to change it since. Which says a lot about how well it plays out in my life. I was tempted to try the randomizer, but not enough to abandon SMEMA yet. Looking forward to Mark's new ideas on combining them!</div>

<div class="content">I had a situation tonight where I could have worked on about a dozen things, large and small. And the choice of what to do first was paralyzing (mainly because it's late, I'm tired, I had some physical energy but not much brain energy, and all I could think of was more things to do).<br><br>After a bit of deliberation, I fed the tasks (including some fun, relaxing stuff) into random.org's List Randomizer. I decided to do the first two or three and then re-randomize. I wound up just doing the first one -- write a blog post -- which took an hour. I thought I'd just do a little bit of work on the blog post but I got absorbed and finished it off. I would *never* have chosen that task on my own, with AF or FV or anything else, simply because I thought beforehand that I didn't have the energy or focus for it. <br><br>I also decided, after finishing the post, that I didn't need to do anything else on the randomized list for the evening. I felt satisfied that I had used my time well. <br><br>I have to say -- using the randomizer is pretty wild. It challenges my expectations. It will be interesting to see how long I continue using it and for what.</div>

<div class="content">I'm still using SMEMA (along with checklists, ticklers, calendar, & big-3 daily focus items to keep myself aware of routine and important things I might otherwise forget about). Not really tempted to go back to a big long list of tasks.<br><br>Regarding combining randomization with SMEMA, I would suggest using a coin (instead of a die or computer RNG). When there's only one item on the SMEMA list, that's the next thing to do (right after you list two more tasks). But then you could flip a coin to decide which of the remaining two to do first.</div>

<div class="content">Ah - I have fond memories of this system.</div>

<div class="content">Ah, SMEMA with a randomizer would be interesting. I assume the best framework for this might be choosing the first topic 'intuitively' as before, then randomizing the following two from a list (long or short) as in the newest system. Ubi's coin-flip sounds interesting too.<br><br>I'm putting SMEMA aside for a few days to give the newer system a go. So far so good, with one or two misgivings, but generally very good. I can see myself switching between the two in the long term.<br><br>I love the analogue way of doing things, so notepad, Parker propelling pencil and - thanks to whoever suggested it - a twenty-sided die for me...</div>
