<div class="content">Just saw this nicely-developed system for marking tasks - I might try it in my AF notebook, but first I have to practice drawing circles for a while :)<br><br>The system is described here, but really you just have to look at the first picture on the page to get it: <a href="http://font.is/?p=790" rel="nofollow">http://font.is/?p=790</a></div>

<div class="content">This is interesting. It looks like a nice way of keeping track of progress on projects in order to decide what to do next. <br><br>I don't feel a need for such a system in AF, as I don't need to worry that I will forget to progress on a project; I trust that I will make progress on everything little by little. A system like this might even interfere with my ability to make a decision for a next task (I would probably start comparing tasks and trying to choose those I can finish quickly or those I have barely worked on at all). <br><br>Perhaps this would help some of those who are having trouble figuring out which tasks "stand out".</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the link. I think I'll have a go at trying a circle notation in the margin rather than crossing out finished tasks.<br><br>In my AF notebook the messiness of crossed out items makes it hard to see the wood for the trees. My attention needs to be on the items that need doing but the items that grab my attention visually are the crossed out items.<br><br>Just looking at an ugly messy page full of crossed out items is enough to start the hackles of resistance rising and put me off looking at my AF notebook (or at least looking at the important messy pages containing mostly remaining high resistance items).<br><br>Just my £0.2. I'm sure people with neater writing find this less of a problem but does anyone have similar issues with lots of crossed out items?<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br>I know exactly what you mean. I was resisting looking at my list when I was crossing out items with the pen. As if my life wasn't messy enough without a messy list! ;-)<br><br>I started using a green highlighter pen to "cross out" instead. Have a look at:<br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonaz/3304722002/in/pool-autofocustimesystem" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonaz/3304722002/in/pool-autofocustimesystem</a><br><br>/jonaz<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike, don't cross it out, but tick it off. At least, that's what I do.<br>When the lighting is bad I even leave empty lines between the items in order to see anything.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Or, if you want to cross it out, use a ruler.  Yeah, I know.  I used to mock my neighbor when he did that.  I also got sick of the messed up cross outs and the check marks are just harder to see when I am scanning the list.  A highlighter might work, but the ruler drawing a straight line neatly through the tasks really works well too.</div>

<div class="content">I had the same problem with  messy cross-outs. Now I draw a rectangle around the task and fill in the rectangle. Nice neat cross-outs  really do make the rest of the items very noticeable.</div>

<div class="content">If you're feeling up to sharing your crossing-out, checking-off, striking-out, circling, rectangling... please feel free to do so in the flickr group:<br><br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/autofocustimesystem/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/groups/autofocustimesystem/</a><br><br>Always interesting to hear, and see, how other people are making their system work for them.<br><br>/jonaz</div>

<div class="content"><a href="http://www.printablepaper.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.printablepaper.net/</a><br><br>I like to use graph paper because it makes for easy cross outs without a ruler or can be used for check boxes.  Whatever kind of paper you like you can print your own at the link above.</div>

<div class="content">This just goes to show how different people can do the same thing different ways, and it still works for each individual. I like slashing a bold line through a task I've worked on. It gives me a sense of satisfaction, which encourages me to work on even more tasks. I also like looking at a page and seeing lots and lots of wonderful, messy cross-outs. In fact, I think I sort of associate a "messy" page in my notebook with accomplishment. Weird but true.  : )<br></div>
