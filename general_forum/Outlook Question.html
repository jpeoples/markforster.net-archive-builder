<div class="content">Sorry folks - a totally non AF related question here!<br><br>I'm just setting up a new computer for my Dad and of course the basic MS Office version doesn't come with Outlook.  Can anyone advise me regarding the other email programs out there such as Mozilla or Eudora - or any others?  Preferably something that looks pretty much like Outlook so it's easy for Dad to pick up?  I've always stuck with Outlook myself so know next to nothing about the alternatives :-(<br><br>Thanks!<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I'm a Thunderbird user myself. I also installed it for my parents and they get along just fine. I enjoy the power Thunderbird gives me via extensions, my parents enjoy its simplicity in its original form. It doesn't look exactly like outlook, but the main functions of a mail program are all pretty straight forward. Here's a tutorial to get started quickly: <a href="http://opensourcearticles.com/articles/thunderbird_15/english/part_01" rel="nofollow">http://opensourcearticles.com/articles/thunderbird_15/english/part_01</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>Goodness, that was quick!!!  Many thanks for that - it looks like a good option and also that it will not be a problem to import existing mail.  I really appreciate the advice - thank you.<br><br>I now have the fun of locating Dad's old files - his old XP machine died (power source I believe rather than drive - so I have the fun of locating data files from all the lovely obscure places that Microsoft hides them ..... what joy!! <br><br>Thanks again Andreas</div>

<div class="content">You could add a pretty good calendar to Thunderbird as an addon:<br><br><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>Not a recommendation, per se, but his machine probably DID come with Outlook Express, which is a servicible email client and is already there.  Probably something like Thunderbird will be better, however.<br><br>I don't recall where Outlook stashes its stuff, but I remember that I did recover mail for a neighbor once and a Google search will turn up some instructions.  Basically it came down to adding dummy folders then copying thing to the new dummies.  But then you are not just recovering, you are trying to extract.  That might be more fun ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Otto, that's great.<br><br>I can see I need to check out Site Delta Andreas - Mark's site has been incredibly unresponsive this week - of course it could be the number of tabs I have open..... :-)<br><br>Thanks Mike. I had several licences for Office so had been able to install Outlook on his old PC with NEO but Thunderbird looks pretty good.  I'm not too worried about finding his mail - it's all the other obscure places that program data gets hidden and it's a real pain locating stuff from a disc read without accessing the programs through the original OS.  Still it could be worse - his old machine could have been Vista with all those helpful virtual stores! :-)<br><br>Thanks guys - much appreciated!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>Another vote for Thunderbird as it's straightfoward and powerful. An alternative is to open a Google Mail account and use that email ID (or forward from his current email to it). Gmail is easy to use and has the advantage of being available anywhere via the web.<br><br>Jonathan</div>

<div class="content">I am using Thunderbird at work and have been cursing it since day 1 for not having the functionality that my Outlook or even Lotus Notes had.  It might be the version or the way I have it configured/not customized.  <br><br>Is there a way on T-bird to find the related messages (all the reply strings etc.?)<br><br>Thanks for the tip about the calendar!  I might not be able to download an add-on at work, but I will definitely try this today.  That's been driving me nuts too.<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for all the advice - greatly appreciated.  Went to pick up Dad's new PC today to find it was dead :-(  We had gotten a great deal on an end of range Sony All in One but as it was end of range, and therefore last demo version, needed remastering.  Drove all the way to the store only to be told it was dead and we could have a refund or choose something else - chose something else - out of stock - chose something else - out of stock!!!  Where did all the efficiency go??????  Finally got a discount on their last (not end of range) model which needs remastering but it is a pretty high spec machine so Dad will have all he needs.  Hmmmmmm - I want a new PC now!!!!<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I'd just stump up for Outlook.  I tried windows mail and various on-line systems, none of them held a candle to outlook.  It is an outrage that the non-commercial Office deosn't come with outlook and the basic outlook doesn't have one note.  An opportunity for Uncle Bill to receive another 40 quid from me.  Grrrrrr.</div>

<div class="content">I'd agree with Thunderbird.<br><br>Though personally, I use gMail at home and have had no problems with it in five years. Google Calendar and it's task list have been mentioned elsewhere. I found it very easy to start with, though the paradigm is rather different and it certainly doesn't look anything like outlook.</div>

<div class="content">The only thing that Google does not have right just yet is the integration.  Outlook at least looks like a single program and you can flit from email to tasks to calendar in a way that appears seamless.  In Google, they all appear to be different programs ... you have to think about getting one to like with the other and the result is not always fantastic.  So Outlook might be easer for someone who is not really comfortable with computers.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Outlook stores its data in files with a PST extension.  That might help in searching for it.<br><br>Now if he was really using Outlook Express, that's a different animal altogether.  It stores its mail in a proprietary database of sorts that is buried in a hidden folder somewhere under Application Data.  Hopefully this isn't what you are dealing with.<br><br>I am happy with Outlook at work.  (Good thing, we don't have a choice.)  But at home I use Thunderbird.  I like it a lot better on a PC that I control because it lets me control so much by using extensions.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for all the info everyone!  Haven't even got to the email yet - have managed to get MS Money 99 running under Vista but it tells me the old files are corrupted!!!  And OpenOffice spreadsheets won't convert back to Excel.  Grrrrrrrrr.  Guess what I'll be doing this weekend :-)</div>
