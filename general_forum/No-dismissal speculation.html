<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-08-29 18:22</div>
<div class="content">Since Mark's "Experimenting again" thread has stretched to two pages, it seems like time to start a new one, in this case focusing on our wild speculations as to what he means by there being no dismissal in the new system. A few guesses have been posited, and shot down already.<br><br>My first guess is that there is some sort of limit to the number of tasks or pages, beyond which the oldest undone task(s) must be crossed off and either reentered or deleted (forever). This would not be "dismissal" as Mark has defined it previously, where one would highlight the undone tasks on the page and then consider reentering them after a period of reflection.  Of course, if one simply reenters everything, the number of tasks will not change, but presumably some of the old stuff would simply be deleted.<br><br>My second guess is similar but more radical: perhaps there is a rule that, after a certain number of page visits (N-1), every undone task must be done on the Nth visit to that page. This would be like the old C2 rule in SF. Of course, deciding not to do a task (i.e. delete it) is a valid action, so there is still an escape hatch here.<br><br>Please post your guesses, until Mark reveals the answer.</div>

<div class="content">Every time Mark invents a system, there's speculation about maybe this or that or the other innovation on previous systems.  No one has ever successfully guessed, except for DWM where Mark left an abundance of clues on its workings.  Then Mark reveals the system and it turns out to have a unique innovation not apparent in any previous systems.  <br><br>Every time.</div>

<div class="content">That would be par for the course with the Guide. Refer to the above advisory message. ;-)</div>
