<div class="content">One of the biggest barriers I have to being productive is surfing the internet - it seems to have an irresistable lure for me.  I'm not sure if it is procrastination, a lack of self control or an insatiable urge for knowledge!<br><br>Does anyone else have this problem, and have you found useful ways of curtailing this?  I have tried switching it off, but it's so easy to launch it again ...<br><br>I almost feel that it is a 'naughty' secret I have, but I do notice that others (for example my husband) also seem to have a bit of an addiction to it.</div>

<div class="content">I think everybody who is online suffers from this to some extent :-)<br><br>I use the RescueTime service ( <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.rescuetime.com/</a> ) to block web browser access for periods of time when I am supposed to be working. <br><br>The web browser blocking aspect is not free but I find it worth the cost.</div>

<div class="content">Frank - that looks scary!  If I tracked how much time I spend on the internet I doubt I would be able to look myself in the face again!  I'll look into this, although I would have preferred a cost free solution!</div>

<div class="content">Alison, <br><br>I use LeechBlock, which is free from <a href="http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock.html</a>  <br><br>It's got all sorts of bells and whistles for blocking particular sites, or blocking them during specified periods - but I just use the simple Lockdown option, which blocks access to the whole Net for a specified time from the present moment. To cancel it, you have to type in a random 32-character string that's presented to you. (I think there's a 64-character option if that isn't enough of a deterrent.)<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Surfing the internet and being productive are not mutually exclusive. I use it all the time for work, education, and help with productivity systems (e.g. this site!). If you're feeling guilty about surfing, you're admitting that the sites you're visiting are not work-related. So perhaps it would be better to track blocks of solid work time. Two methods for doing this are the Pomodoro technique - <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.pomodorotechnique.com</a> - and the Unschedule - <a href="http://www.neilfiore.com/nowhabit-schedule.shtml." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.neilfiore.com/nowhabit-schedule.shtml.</a> Both of these involve tracking timed work blocks - 25 to 30 minutes - and rewarding yourself with shorter breaks. You can use your reward times for non-work surfing, and not feel guilty about it!</div>

<div class="content">Allison, you are posting on an internet forum worried about your naughty secret of surfing the internet? Don't worry, many, many of us have the same naughty secret.<br><br>I think Mark would suggest adding the task "Surf the internet for 15 min" to your list and then do that task as it stands out. You could change the time of course, and add it to the list multiple times, but only do it when it stands out, i.e. when you have come to it on that page (in AF1, for example.) If you use SAF, I would never reenter it in the right hand column for any reason.</div>

<div class="content">I canceled my home internet service for that reason.  Of course I still have an Phone..., and work...<br><br>"Get Everything Done" does not and cannot possibly mean "Read everything on the internet".  I used to worry about missing out on stuff, but now there's more stuff than I could possibly ever see to worry about missing it.  Everything out there on the web is interesting, but so what?  Leave it alone, and more interesting stuff will be there next time you look online.  <br><br>The Read It Later app is helpful for this.  If I see something interesting, I click the Read it Later button, and stop the surfing.  Later, I have a list of things to read.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting feedback thank you.  I think I tend to be a bit compulsive - for example I can check a site like this one several times a day, when in reality checking it once or twice would be ample!  <br><br>I accept that the internet is a great source for work - and I do have to do research for my work in the internet - I just find it far too easy to get side tracked onto less productive (but more amusing) websites!<br><br>I suppose a healthy dose of self discipline wouldn't go amiss! It's great to know I'm not the only one with a problem though!</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br><<<< Later, I have a list of things to read. >><br>Which you never get round to reading? >><br><br>LOL, no, I have a task called Read Stuff.  Typically it means pick on of the things I've saved for later, and read it now.</div>

<div class="content">I have a group of bookmarks called Daily. The idea is I open the group once per day, and only once per day. This includes low-priority email addresses.<br><br>Sometimes I have another group for a few times a week. It varies with the number of sites and active discussions.<br><br>Last year I didn't turn on the internet until lunch time. That worked great. This year I start the day with an hour's brisk walk and have no resistance when I get back. Sigh.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alison,<br><br>Although I have a 24/7 Internet connection at work, I often turn it off to ensure no interruptions, including Skype.  When I am on Skype, I normally lurk as 'Invisible' to stop unwanted interruptions.<br><br>When it is on, I only retrieve/send emails three times during the day, unless it is really important and urgent, eg in response to a phone call.<br><br>At the apartment here in Damascus, I have no ADSL 24/7, only dialup (remember that?) or a fragile 3g modem connection.<br><br>My email signature has the following statement:<br><br>'NB: Internet/email is not always 24/7, if no response and urgent, call/SMS me'<br><br>Works for me.  BTW, today is the first day of Eid al Adha, a three day event which translates into a five day long weekend, so no ADSL for me till Sunday!</div>
