<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>One thing I think that is really lacking from GTD, AF1 and AF2 (but is present in DIT) is that it doesn't encourage you to make a *plan for the day* but suggest you pick your items ad hoc. This is the reason why these systems don't work for me.<br><br>My current system is as follows:<br><br>1) Capture everthing I want/would like to do in a number of lists (laptop+phone is the main list but I also have home, work and shopping)<br><br>This is the main thing in GTD that really works for me, the rest is too complicated for my liking.<br><br>What I learned from AF though is that it really works to keep this list in the order (also add dates for every new day) of when tasks were added. I usually 'hang out' around the bottom of the list. Every now and then I clean up and scan for 'old' items I do actually want to do and highlight them and dismiss stuff I don't. The big advantage in maintaining the order and dates of when an item was added is that you get a sense of how long you have chosen *not* to do it!<br><br>Doing some work towards the item allows me to add it to the end again. Great idea borrowed from AF!<br><br>2) Make a *plan for the day* by picking items on the lists and start with the most important (often the most procrastinated) item and so on. I take some time to do this proparly!<br><br>If I don't make a plan of the day and pick items *ad hoc* like GTD and Autofocus suggest I always end up procrastinating on something important.<br><br>Maintaining the order of the plan (unlike DIT) and starting with the important stuff is a biggie too, since else I end up putting the high resistance item mid way the list and often find a way to avoid it.<br><br>3) Appy the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechinique.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pomodorotechinique.com</a>  to actioning the list (only discovered it two days ago and totally love it!)<br><br>What do you guys think? Anyone else use a similar approach?<br></div>

<div class="content">That's kind of like "AF condensed" Cruisader, and why I use it Monday - Friday and switch back to AF1 on weekends.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>would you please so kind as to explain what the term "AF condensed" means, please. I have read it several times on this forum but never understood what people mean when they use it.<br></div>

<div class="content">Rainer, I do something similar to what Simon described.  Mine might be a little consciously specific goal-oriented though.  <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/772038#post777115" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/772038#post777115</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jaqueline,<br><br>I read the post by Simon on AF condensed. Very interesting idea!!<br><br>The systems are almost the same. Main difference is staying on the list or not which has both pro's and cons...<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Cruisader, yes, they are similar - AFC is ideal to really push towards major goals by cherry picking / picking the high fruit, not the low, easy stuff.  I don't really care about getting a lot of stuff done if it's not the right things.  <br><br></div>
