<div class="content">Greetings!<br><br>I've been very successfully using DWM2 with Toodledo on my iPhone, thanks to Mark's brilliant description of how to run a DWM-style system using a single list.  Thanks for that, Mark!<br><br>I do have one issue that has come up a few times, and would like some guidance.  One of the beauties of DWM2 (and DWM, to an extent) is that you can "skip" days where you don't have time to work on anything on your list -- time only marches forward if you're actually able to work on your list.  For time-based dismissal, this can be a life-saver.<br><br>I regularly have days where I'm simply not going to get anything done on my list.  On Tuesdays, for example, I almost never have any discretionary time, and Saturdays are family days so I rarely use my list then either.<br><br>With DWM2, you can skip these "non-doing" days by just not adding another heading to the end of the list.  If I don't do any work from my list on Saturday, for example, then on Sunday (when I do generally get time to do home tasks) I can add the next heading and continue working from there.<br><br>So far so good...in terms of my DWM2 list, it's as if Saturday never happened.  All this works brilliantly, and makes the time-based dismissal work well on those days when I simply can't get anything done.  But...just because I'm having a non-doing day doesn't mean that I don't come up with new tasks to add to my list.  I'll often remember that I need to do something, or receive an email or other request on these non-doing days.<br><br>How should I handle these?  Since I won't add the new day's heading (and dismiss old items) until the next day when I can actually work from my list, should I just continue to add new items on these non-doing days to the list of tasks for the previous day?  Or should I add a new day's heading anyway, and then try to remember on the next "doing day" that I've already added a heading?  Or should I suck it up and mark a non-doing day as a new day in my system, even though all I can do on that day is add new items to the list?  I guess I'm concerned about items coming up for dismissal (especially unfinished tasks with a life of only seven days) on those days when I simply can't do anything about them.<br><br>Any suggestions?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br> - Erik.</div>

<div class="content">Kiwi:<br><br>My own preference would be to treat a "non-doing" day as an extension of the last "doing day" - so you would add new tasks to the previous day's list.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, Mark.  That's a great solution -- by treating the "non-doing" day as an extension of the previous "doing" day, you don't have to remember whether you've added the new day's heading, or deal with dismissal on those days when all you're doing is adding new items to the list.<br><br>Thanks for solving my dilemma!<br><br> - Erik.</div>
