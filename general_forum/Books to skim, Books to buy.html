<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-06-19 16:40</div>
<div class="content">In the spirit of Mark's recent comment: <br><br>"How many times have I skimmed a book in a bookshop, thought it was great, bought it, and then when I get it home find that I got everything worthwhile out of it during the skim!"<br><br>I thought I would create a new post, asking people to list the most essential NON-skimming books. Here are a few of mine:<br><br>Marriage/Relationships:<br>Passionate Marriage by Dr. David Schnarch<br><br>Goal-setting & Planning:<br>Wishcraft by Barbara Sher<br><br>Motivation:<br>War of Art by Steven Pressfield<br><br>Art/Creativity:<br>The Creative License by Danny Greggory <br><br>Entrepreneurship (For therapists):<br>12 Months to Your Ideal Private Practice<br><br><br></div>

Really good book so far.<br><br>Here's the product description:<br><br>Drawing upon years of her own pioneering research with thousands of men and women, psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky reveals that much of our capacity for happiness is within our power.

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>I bought Working Identities on your recommendation. I am about 3/4 through it and I am glad I bought it. Thanks.<br><br>I also just received It's Okay To Be The Boss. With AF, lately, I've been using little and often on books. I have lots of books that I am reading concurrently. I realize that it's getting out of control. So I am trying not to start any more books until I finish a few that I am still in the middle of.<br><br>Regarding Lyubomirsky's book. I bought it with great anticipation. She has a research article, which you can read for free in its entirety<br> <br>    <a href="http://tiny.cc/G0qtB" rel="nofollow">http://tiny.cc/G0qtB</a><br><br><br>that astounded me.<br><br>In a nutshell, she confirmed that writing or speaking about your thoughts and feelings about negative emotional events makes you feel better. And she demonstrated that writing or speaking about your thoughts and feelings about positive emotional events makes you feel worse.<br><br>I believe that kind of research is directly relevant to much of the work that Mark Forster and others do. So much of it is about getting your thoughts, and sometimes your feelings, written down either on paper or digitally. Traditional psychotherapy is "talk therapy." You probably don't need all that theoretical baggage of the id, transference, or archetypes. You just need to talk about your thoughts and feelings with someone else listening (actually, you don't even need the listener). And then there are a lot of cognitive-behavioral-therapy methods, many of which involve writing down your moods and then rationally disputing them.<br><br>So, the point of this rambling post, if there is one, is that you might want to read her article in addition to--or instead of--her book.<br><br>[If there are problems with the link, use your search engine for the title "The Costs and Benefits of Writing, Talking, and Thinking About Life’s<br>Triumphs and Defeats."]<br></div>

<div class="content">>> You probably don't need all that theoretical baggage of the id transference, or archetypes.>><br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by "You probably don't need.... ". If by "not needing", you mean "not needing" to understand the unconscious process to grow, heal, etc I would agree with you. Therapists DO need to appreciate the unconscious process. The "curative" factor of talking therapy is partly explained by the interpretation of  transference.  <br><br>>> You just need to talk about your thoughts and feelings with someone else listening (actually, you don't even need the listener)>><br><br>I strongly disagree. One of the primary reasons people are disconnected from their hopes, dreams, etc., is because they were talking, but no one was listening and/or empathizing. Or in Family Systems parlance... you weren't Seen, Heard, and/or Understood by your family or origin. The end result is an feeling of ennui, and daily choices (mates, jobs, etc) based on rebellion or pleasing others. Therapy works because:<br><br>a) the therapist is trained to NOT get caught up in the content, but rather, to appreciate the process of the session<br>b) to provide a holding enviornment where an individual, or family, begins to experience themselves, and others, in a brand new way. <br><br>For the most part, friends and family are unable to do this for us. In general, they have a vested interest in homeostasis, because they GET something from our inability to change.</div>

<div class="content">Re: Moises and article on writing, speaking and thinking about positive events:<br><br>Interesting studies, it's worth noting that the results/conclusions from the studies require nuanced interpretation. <br><br><<In a nutshell, she confirmed that writing or speaking about your thoughts and feelings about negative emotional events makes you feel better. And she demonstrated that writing or speaking about your thoughts and feelings about positive emotional events makes you feel worse.>><br><br>I don't think the studies indicate that. It's how you think, write or speak that influence how you feel. In her experiments she did use different 'how's' and compared the groups. It wasn't that conclusive that for example, writing about a positive life event causes worser feelings, it's just that in comparison to the other experimental groups, lower feelings were reported. There is some indication that writing about a life event in an analytical fashion isn't as good as talking or thinking about it and in general doens't boost positive feelings . Like wise writing about a negative life event seems to improve ones feelings, but repetitively thinking about a traumatic experience may do more harm than good. <br><br>It's not as simple as 'think, write or speak' about negative events to feel better and don't think, write or speak about positive events or you might feel worse...<br><br>in fact, people that have just experienced trauma usually do worse when they have to speak, think or write about what happened shortly after they have experienced the trauma. And as the paper mentions, it depends on how you think, write, speak . Thinking repetitively about a positive event seems to have a positive effect according to that particular study. (gloating can be quite pleasurable can it not!)<br><br>The interesting thing is that people don't tend to analyze positive events. Part of the reason is that there is no reason to and the other reason is that people that feel good process information differently compared to people that feel bad. If you feel bad, you tend to process information systematically, i.e. detail oriented. If you feel good, you tend to process information more superficially, using heuristics. I think the lesson in that is if you want to feel good, don't analyse!<br></div>

<div class="content">MOK, I know what you mean - I've decluttered pretty much all of mine.  That's why I wouldn't recommend anything that I wouldn't literally buy again if I lost it.  I also wouldn't recommend anything on this site where I don't feel the philosophy meshes with AF.  <br><br>In my earlier post (June 20 above) I have only listed the books that I feel I really got "an answer" from - *for me* - and the answer was that it was inside (which is exactly the philosophy that Effortless Success  - and Autofocus to a certain extent - espouses.)   <br><br>I look at it this way - people generally grow up and follow their parents way of thinking and then their friends and coworker's way of thinking - because they know of no other way.  Books are the way to expose ourselves to some of the best thinkers who ever lived.  <br><br>Michael Neill is the least snake-oil salesman self-help author and speaker I've ever heard / read, and I've met - and been disappointed by - quite a few.</div>

<div class="content">I purchased Michael Neill's audiobook, and could not make it past the 30 minute mark. I'm stunned that there was 5+ hours of material left. My overall thought: Anthony Robbins-lite. I'll stick to Barbara Sher when I need a motivation boost.</div>

<div class="content">Wow Avrum - I find him very similar to Barbara Sher - different strokes, I guess.  But then, I did listen to his radio show weekly for a couple of years.  I decluttered my Tony Robbins books without a qualm - too much of success = money to me.  That's what I love about Sher - success = doing what you love.<br><br>Being a former self-help junkie, one of the best things I ever did was to quit hopping from program to program and find something that resonates and to stick with it, work with it daily and see where it takes me, then adjust it to fit me.   Unfortunately, sometimes you have to go through quite a lot of junk to get to the gold that really resonates.  That's what libraries and speed reading are for.  The same thing holds true for time management systems.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Jacquline,<br><br>One of the most helpful skills I picked up is that of "translating" people's ideas.  Tony Robbins, for example, really does go overboard with the Success=Money idea.  (Can you say E3?  ;-)<br><br>However, his ideas (or rather his repackaging of some very basic NLP ideas in ways that can be used to get to his ends) are valid for change work in general.  If you listen to him scream on disk or tape, you can simply tune out his message and substitute your own.<br><br>What does he suggest in order to become super rich?<br><br>- Define goals ... yup, that works for most things<br>- Define values ... yup<br>- Focus on one thing at a time ... yup<br>- Build strong reasons and images to get what you want ... yup<br>- etc.<br><br>Not being critical of your dumping your TR material ... he can be way more than tiresome, but I have found that cultivating the skill of translating can be very helpful in utilizing the methods of someone who has different goals.  Stephen Covey's ideas about importance and urgency are great, so long as you tune out his religious bias.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I dumped them because there are some books that are very popular (like TR) that I can pick up out of the library at any time I want to have a re-read - not necessarily because I don't think there's some validity to them.  I don't need them cluttering my bookshelves if I don't use them on a regular basis.   Besides, one day I want to be like you and have a kindle... :-)<br><br>I'm also not too keen on any self-professed *gurus* that say "this is the way, the right way, the only way."  I tend to follow the "try this and see if it works for you - if it doesn't click fairly quickly, use what works and try something else" philosophy.   <br><br>I'm not quite as good at the "tuning out" as you are.  That's why I stay away from audio books unless I really agree with the message.  What I have done with many books that I feel I need to tune out some part of which I don't agree with is to make my own set of notes.  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">>> Stephen Covey's ideas about importance and urgency are great, so long as you tune out his religious bias. <br><br>Why tune out his religious bias? As a "one foot in, one foot out" religious Jew, I admire a productivity author who isn't ashamed to place his goals/projects within the context of sublime ideas.  <br><br>Now if you subscribe to scientism as the be all and end all, Covey will rub you the wrong way. <br><br>I agree with Jacqueline. By the time you tune out Robbins schlock, all you have left is a dust jacket. <br><br>Perhaps that's why I love Sher. She's crusty, but her ideas are so damn practical and life affirming. Wishcraft is the only self-help book I've ever recommended to clients struggling with career issues. Alas, like everything else, it ain't a panacea though.</div>

I'm kidding, sorta. My knee-jerk reaction to purchase MORE productivity books states more about inner-world (a fantasy that a book can replace hard work, remove fear, etc., etc) than my outer-world (doing the shit I need/must do).</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>Why tune out the religious bias?  Because it is irrelevant to the reason I want the book.  I have no problem with a person standing for what he believes in, I only have a problem when he preaches it to me, the captive audience.<br><br>Robbins:  He lost me with his food fads.

<div class="content">"what do you do when you're uninspired and itching for a purchase?"<br><br>I know what you mean.  I think it comes down to a matter of not having found (or created for yourself) just the right thing or combination of things.  It's that feeling like you feel that your wife is your soul mate.   Or when you find a diet that you can follow that just fits with your life.  Or a job where you really enjoy going to work on Mondays.  Or when you find a time management system that just works well with your life and your issues.  <br><br>It's like using Autofocus to me - some days I still can't bring myself to work on the book.  Then I start imagining how wonderful life would be if I could schedule myself somewhat rigidly like I did in my 20's and early 30's.    Then I start having fantasies of divorcing Mark and hanging out with Brian Tracy.  Eventually I wake up, of course.  Because the truth is if I can't / don't want to manage to schedule AF time, I sure can't schedule major projects.<br><br>Re. hard work and fear - there's a book I haven't read (it's not available in my library) that might help with that - Mike twigged my memory when he mentioned E3 (easy, effortless and enjoyable) - although that may not be what he was referring to.  A Stanford professor called Michael Ray wrote a book called Creativity in Business which I did read a long time ago.  <br><br>Here's an excerpt from one of the reviews on Amazon:<br>"Much emphasis is put on intuition and instinct, the value of being naive, and forging onward without a definitive game plan." - sound familiar?<br><br>Anyway, here's the book that I read. It's 20 years old, but from what I recall, it's principles would still hold true - he's got a marketing background and I used it for my business - didn't apply it because I was still in my "force the river" phase.<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Business-Michael-Ray/dp/0385248512/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249658245&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Business-Michael-Ray/dp/0385248512/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249658245&sr=8-2</a><br><br>And here's the one that I want out of the library but they don't have it. :-( I need to do some work on E3. :-)<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Highest-Goal-Secret-Sustains-Moment/dp/1576753522/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249658482&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Highest-Goal-Secret-Sustains-Moment/dp/1576753522/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249658482&sr=1-1</a><br><br><a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=6KbFlz_WEwgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=michael+ray#v=onepage&q=&f=false" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.ca/books?id=6KbFlz_WEwgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=michael+ray#v=onepage&q=&f=false</a><br><br>I wonder if there comes a time when you just stop looking for answers and start really using / delving deeper into what you know? (Or are aware of - there are those that say that if you don't apply what you *know* you don't really *know* it - whatever.)  Stop taking the 'history 101' classes and really delve into the Roman period.  I know that happened to me about 5 or 6 years ago kind of cold turkey, but it started tapering off when I was around 33 or so.  I rarely go into a bookstore now, I still go to the library, but usually am getting books on landscaping, plumbing, mystery novels or old movies.  So there's hope for you yet Avrum.  :-)  You're probably just a scanner and inquisitive - nothing wrong with that.<br><br>I have thought that when I get finished this tour of work duty, that after a few months sabbatical, I would love to go on Sher's Scanner Retreat.  I almost went this year, but I wanted to wait until I had the time to really put it into practice.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Martin - true enough. <br><br>Though I wasn't turned off by Covey's spiritual/religous message, I didn't read the 7 habits for that purpose. The Jewish tradition has more than enough theological, legal, ethical & mystical lit for me. Most of which I've barely scratched the surface.</div>

<div class="content">I guess what I really like about Mark is that he is not "selling" anything (in the sense of smuggling messages in to his "products".)  It is TM and TM is all it is.  If you want religion, or diet, or exercise, or Top-100 music, you can use AF to manage it but go elsewhere for that content.<br><br>This is one reason AF is so much quicker to grasp (beside just being simpler) ... one does not have to filter it to get the crap out and find out what the system is.</div>
