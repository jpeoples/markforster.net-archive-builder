<div class="content">I finally got down to 3 active pages, and I have to admit, it's kind of boring.  (Technically only 2 pages since the last item on the oldest page is to pay my son for the month of March - hmmm I could dismiss it....) :-)  OTOH, 22 active pages just a week or so ago wasn't incredibly fun either, but I felt a surge of energy in wanting to bring down the numbers.  Somewhere there's a happy medium, and I'm sure I'll find it.  I promised myself that once I got below 5 pages, I'd go through the dismissed items from my earlier dumping/dismissing sessions, which I have, and there's nothing I'm prepared to bring back in just yet.  <br><br>Once the next hard week at work is over, I'm planning to bring 2-3 of my renovation projects onto the list (one easy, one harder).  I'm not sure where to start though as by this time I had initially planned to spend April-May working outside on the yard, deck, garage etc., but the weather isn't cooperating with me.  Whatever happened to global warming??  <br><br>I miss the variety that I had with my old, longer list.  Yet I don't want to get to the point again of dumping onto the list and dismissing later.   I've created a void of sorts, and need to fill it with something other than cleaning and renovating.  Finally, I have time to pursue a hobby that works with discretionary time!  At least until the weather cooperates and I can go hiking and play tennis again.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Probably because you have a wide variety on your list Christine and I don't.  :-(  The only backlog I started out with was the a bit of a messy house and the renos.  The dog's getting lots of walks today anyway and tomorrow I'll go into work to keep myself occupied and to be able to work without interruption.   <br><br>I've started cooking more elaborate meals lately, which is usually a sign that I'm not stressed out.  Something tells me I'll be going skiing next weekend.  It's nice to be able to plan for something like that and not feel that I should be doing something more "productive".  Although that does fulfil the "fitness" task on my list too.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mmm...why haven't I been skiing since 1970? He mused, reaching for his list. That'll frighten the boys...</div>

<div class="content">Will, you don't know what you're missing then.  Parabolic skis have revolutionized skiing.  There's far greater control over speed and direction, and if you haven't done it in awhile, you won't fall like you would have with the old style straight skis.  <br><br>And do wear a helmet.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>You raise a good point. If you are down to just a few pages of boring tasks, add fun stuff. The system can be self-balancing [I am flinching in anticipation of Mike's comment on this] if you allow it to be.</div>

<div class="content">You're right moises.  I like restricting my list to things that I either won't get around to doing on a timely basis, or won't get to at all.  Whether that's emailing friends I've sort of lost touch with or projects that are enjoyable that I haven't spent time with lately like knitting, there are lots of things that I'm thinking of adding in now that I enjoy that I wouldn't have before when my list felt too long.</div>

<div class="content">I try to keep some "wishlist" tasks on my list.  I am talking about things I really want to do but don't think I will get around to.  They end up being either dismissed, or I get cool surprising things done, a little at a time.</div>
