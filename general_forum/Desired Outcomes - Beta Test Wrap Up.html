<div class="content">Well after the thirty days, I am wrapping the Beta Test.  The results were both exciting and disappointing at the same time.  The disappointment was that 27 people joined the Beta test yet only a few followed through with the commitment to provide feedback either positive or negative.  The feedback I did get from the people that actually did the program was for the most part positive.  They made progress on their goals, in some instances dramatic progress.  Some people found the program hard as it requires consistency of action (daily), others had a difficult time with the goal selection process.  I feel the bottom line is simple, the program works if people work the program.  Yet many people either thought it would not work so did not do it, or just were curious about it and joined the test.<br><br>I want to thank everyone that participated and especially those that wrote up their feedback.  the positive feedback has been gratifying and if one person enjoyed it and has benefited from it, It has been a success.<br><br>As far as the ebook goes, I will leave a link to it on my blog,   I probably will stop actively promoting it, as the effort has not been worth the time and I want to move on to other pursuits.  Quite frankly had I continued to use the method to pursue my goals instead of trying to "sell" the method to others, I would be closer to my goals.  It has been a valuable experience writing the ebook along with the other ebooks I have written, I just think most people on the internet are looking for free information and are resistant to pay for ebooks from unknown authors.  <br><br>Thanks again to the participants.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry, I'm sorry that I signed up and then didn;t do much with it.  My father is extremelly ill and of course a lot of this sort of thing has gone out of the window.  I have kept the material and will have a go at it when things are more settled.  Once again my apologies.</div>

<div class="content">Alison,<br><br>No apology is needed.  I was not trying to single people out with my comments.  I have received enough feedback to believe the method works if people work it.  I totally understand family needs to come first and I hope things improve.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry,<br><br>I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to pariticipate in the beta test  and also for your work to author the DOIT e-book.  While it may be difficult to sel the e-book,  that doesn't diminish the positive impact your efforts have had or will have in the future.   I will continue to plug away at the method as I see it as a good vehicle to move the yardsticks forward.  Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">Gerry,<br>I must admit that I just read the eBook this morning. The method sounds interesting and promising and I will give it a try, ideally combining it with DWM which helps me to deal with the nitty-gritty...<br>Thanks for sharing it and I'll give you my feedback later, if you are still interested.</div>
