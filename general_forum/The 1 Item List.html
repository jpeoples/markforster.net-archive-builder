<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I use several different systems to keep track of things at a time.  I used AF1 for several months at one point and was really productive, but finally had to abandon the system because my lists (home and work) just became too long and I could never get to the end of a list.<br><br>Anyway, I wanted to share a small side experiment that I started recently - each morning I write down the one thing that I will obsess (if necessary) over and get done no matter what that day.  And I'm numbering the days to see how many in a row I can complete.  Today was successful - #16 - hurray! <br><br>This has been quite revealing as I've started to more carefully consider each day's goal.  Knowing that I will absolutely be doing something is an interesting feeling.  I guess you could call this a more extreme version of the triple task system, but to me this is more a separate, temporary experiment than a regular part of my overall system(s).  I still have my regular calendar, tickler items, reminders, etc.  I don't always do this item first thing in my day (although the motivation to do it asap is great).  The only rule is it has to be done before I go to bed.<br><br>So now I ask myself -<br><br>Do I have the power to do this step?  Or is it really dependent on someone else?<br><br>Could I choose to do this step or to not do it?  If I'm already absolutely going to do it or not do it, there is no reason to 'waste' my daily goal on it.<br><br>Do I actually want to do it and/or have it done?<br><br>Will I be able to judge in black or white - done or not done?  Because the item gets a check or it doesn't, there is no middle ground.<br><br>What else will I be doing that day?  Big goals for open days, little goals for overwhelming days.<br><br>So far I have avoided narrow choice points such as 'Spend 2 hours on project X' or 'Do step Y by 4:00.'  My days are just too variable and I would just be setting myself up to fail.<br><br>This is an interesting 'trust' building exercise.  Trusting myself to follow thru.<br><br>A couple of my completed items: Call insurance agent for new homeowners quote; complete first draft of 941 (work); Vacuum master bedroom; Finish Nov budget setup; Work on my daughter's closet turnover (putting away my 6 yo's summer clothes and getting out winter items); Schedule Honda maintenance<br><br>Hopefully I haven't jinxed myself by sharing this.  I really enjoy reading this forum and finding different tidbits and ideas to try.</div>

<div class="content">Elynn:<br><br>Very interesting, and if it works for you, then keep at it and share your progress with us like you've done!<br><br>Mark has always emphasised that things that MUST be done that day SHOULD be done no matter what else is on the list.  Instead of the MUST-DO arriving out of the blue or whatever from outside the system, you have decided to make it a priority.  With only ONE, it's hardly prioritising a whole list or part of the list.<br><br>I like the approach of little/big goals for overwhelming/open days, practical.<br><br>I intend sticking to AF4.3T, but will bear your approach in mind if I stray from the path like a lost sheep!</div>

<div class="content">My first book "Get Everything Done" starts with a very similar exercise. In it the idea is to make the one task a little bit more difficult each day.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark<br><br>That was a great exercise, and then scaling it up to two per day, then more . . .<br><br>A recipe for late nights :) - but good for will power.</div>
