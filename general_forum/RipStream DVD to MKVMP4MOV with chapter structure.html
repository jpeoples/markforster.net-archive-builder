You can see the chapter information of your DVD movies on the main interface after you loading to the program. <br>  <br>Then choose the output format. In order to preserve the chapter structure, you’d better choose the “Multi-track Video”. Under this profile, you have three choices which all can preserve chapter structure. If you choose the MKV format, you can output the BD/DVD with lossless quality and allow multiple audio tracks, multiple subtitles. <br>  <br>One special function that makes ByteCopy stands out is you can easily select you needed tracks, subtitles. <br>  <br>The last thing you need to do is hit the “Convert” button to begin the conversion. Just wait a moment and then you can output the MKV/MP4/MOV videos with the chapter structure.
