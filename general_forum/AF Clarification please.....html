<div class="content">Daily, I get things put in my in-tray that represent tasks that take upwards of 40 min- 60 mintues. In AF, does this get logged in to the system, or handled when I handle my paper tasks?<br><br>If it gets logged in to the system, where does that piece of paper reside until I "autofocus" on it?<br><br>Excuse my leftovers from "processing."</div>

<div class="content">The degree of granularity is a question of how things stand out to you.<br><br>Initially, it might make sense to list something "process inbox".<br><br>Tackle that for however long your intuition suggests. During that task you might find yourself explicitly noticing specific pieces of paperwork standing out. <br><br>So you might enter them separately: "Paper A", "Paper B"<br><br>So after first working on "Process Inbox" you might end up with entries:<br><br>Paper A<br>Paper B<br>Paper C<br>Process Inbox<br><br>The degree of granularity will finds it own balance as you practice and your ability to let things stand out grows. Let go a bit of your typical expectations and see what happens.</div>

<div class="content">As Norm said. An inbox can be something you process at once or incrementally, but: Processing is not doing every page therein.  Processing is writing tasks in AF and either discarding the page or putting it in a file for reference when you get to the task.</div>

<div class="content">I should note I don't have an inbox. It usually takes 30 secs to process an incomIng page so I do it on the spot.  But if I get behind I do the above.</div>

<div class="content">@Norman, I like the cascading effect that the AF entries have. I have experienced it a little bit already, but your description helped reinforce that intuition. <br><br>@Alan, I might experiment  a little with processing actions in to AF and filing paperwork. For the extra work thats involved, I like the idea of giving myself a clear space to work from.</div>

<div class="content">"where does that piece of paper reside until I "autofocus" on it?"<br><br>Erik, you might like to try a system that I have used for some 12 months now of having a special  "paper" tray on my desk.  Like Alan, I like to keep my In-box empty and I find that there is often no natural file for paper related to a task in AF.<br><br>For such papers, I use "letter files" (rather stiff plastic sleeves open on two sides).  Once the task is entered into AF, I slip the paper into the letter file and place it at the bottom of the "paper" tray.  That way, the papers are piled in the tray in exactly the same order as they appear in AF and they are easy to find when they stand out for attention in AF.<br><br>At this present moment, I have eleven such temporary files in my "paper" tray.</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>One thing I think is missing from this board is that people tend to jump in and ask questions and never report back on what they decided to do and how it was helpful.<br><br>I often wonder how useful a list of 52 hacks and tweaks from others could possibly help anyone other than fuel the interest and salve the boredom of we productivity nerds.<br><br>This thread remained small and useful and you seem to have gotten something out of it and seem to be a thoughtful inquisitor. Report back later and let us know what helped and what didn't for you. And why you think it was helpful or not.<br><br>Behavior like this might increase the ostensible signal to noise ratio the peanut gallery complains about so much.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">@Jim, can you provide a link to a visual of the letter file you are speaking of?<br><br>@Norman, patience my friend, we are still in testing mode! :)</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>Preferably, wait a few months. I don't think much of import can really be gotten after a few days or weeks. I was just making the suggestion.<br><br>Much of the suggestions in threads around here amount to little more than "sound and fury" I fear. Receiving feedback later might be helpful.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik<br><br>Here is the link to an image of the letter files I referred to:<br>https://orders.stationerysupplies.com.au/stock_images600/105601109.JPG<br>A key advantage of these files is that they are open at the top and at the right and so it is very easy to slip a piece of paper in and out of them. Since they are transparent, you can see at a glance exactly what is in them.<br><br>If you need to, you can pick up the whole pile of files and spread them like a deck of cards to find a required item.  And if your supply comes in assorted colours, it can be even easier to find a particular item since you tend to remember what colour you use for a certain item.  (Mostly I prefer clear plastic files since they are more transparent and they make it easier to see what is inside.)<br><br>Having all your papers in these plastic files makes it very easy to slip new items in at the bottom of the pile so that the items stand in exactly the same order as thy stand in your AF list.  If you care to use this strategy of slipping things in at the bottom, you will find that when your task comes up in AF, the related file is usually at or very near the top of the stack.<br><br>One further thing I find helpful is that when I forget to re-enter an unfinished task in AF, the stray paper rises to the top of the stack and I am reminded to deal appropriately with it.<br><br>Often an AF task will have 3 or 4 different pieces of paper, perhaps of different shapes and sizes, associated with it.  These letter files are ideal for keeping such items together.</div>

<div class="content">Erik<br><br>My link above does not seem to have worked too well.  You might try a link to a uk version:<br><br><a href="http://www.stationerydirect.co.uk/rexel-nyrex-80-letter-file-folder-cut-flush-embossed-a4-clear_1_429.html?awc=2636_1270779519_dff9e1a3b1f1491f448a2457d624d267" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.stationerydirect.co.uk/rexel-nyrex-80-letter-file-folder-cut-flush-embossed-a4-clear_1_429.html?awc=2636_1270779519_dff9e1a3b1f1491f448a2457d624d267</a><br><br>or simply try "letter files" in Google and you should find the product.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-04-13 9:05</div>
<div class="content">I do something very similar to what Jim is doing. I have the plastic letter files labelled A1 to A20 and the file is referenced in AF next to the task it represents. Once the task is completed, I recycle the numbers for the next action document.<br><br>All the letter files reside in the middle tray of my 3 tier paper tray. The top tray is for all incoming documents and mail. The lower tray houses documents for filing.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-04-13 13:42</div>
<div class="content">Interesting variation JD.  Do you try to keep the A1 to A20 files in any numerical order on the stack?  And to you actually give each file a name in the AF list: Like "A6: Lottery ticket - check by Sat."?</div>
<h2>Reply by JD</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-14 8:29</div>
<div class="content">Hi Jim: Yes, I try to retain a numerical order, but in the cut and thrust of a day's work, they can get jumbled up. Plastic slips and slides something awful!<br>They get re-arranged every now and then without too much hassle. <br><br>I name them somewhat in the way you describe: task first (which often refers to the paper itself) followed by the folder number in parenthesis. For eg: Review printed spreadsheet (A6).<br><br>No particular reason why its done that way, I suppose I would like my eyes to fall on the task first, rather the document it refers to, for the purposes of allowing it to stand out better. It's amazing how much resistance one can develop to reaching out for the letter files especially when you are in flow and knocking off tasks quickly.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-04-14 13:08</div>
<div class="content">I feel such resistance too though it's more like a lack of interest in working on something. I think it's the lack of clarifying detail I the task that causes this. Such resistence doesn't happen when I have the page embedded in my list. Of course that's only feasible due to my implementation in OneNote.</div>
<h2>Reply by Jim (Melbourne)</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-14 14:23</div>
<div class="content">Now that's interesting, Alan.  I have exactly the opposite experience.  I have teased out some of my projects in OneNote (largely as a result of Christine B's encouragement about the strengths of OneNote) but I have found that recently all of the projects I had been developing in OneNote have "slipped off" my AF list because they got too detailed and "formidable".<br><br>By contrast, the tasks that are represented by "bits of paper" that have arrived in my Inbox and that I have parked in letter files on my desk seem to be the ones that usually "feel ready" to be done because they are near at hand and usually less complex. <br><br>I guess that it really depends on how comfortable one is with the technology of various methods.  I am more comfortable with the Lo Tech methods but that's just me.</div>

<div class="content">Jim, yours is quite a different scenario.  My OneNote pages are actually my AF list.  If a page slips off then the project is gone.  A task doesn't refer to a separate project page.  When I look at a task, I am actually looking at the embedded project page.  So I can work on it, ignore it, or maybe just tease out what I'm supposed to do next and write that detail in.  I think it's a matter of immediacy that it's working for my setup but not for yours.  In your setup paper is more immediately available.</div>
