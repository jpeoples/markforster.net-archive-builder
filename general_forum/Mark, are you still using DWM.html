<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I know you have been deeply designing and testing a new system, but have you been using DWM since you released it to everyone?  I am just curious... :)<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, David. I missed your earlier posting. I intend to write a blog posting soon on the subject. Suffice it to say that the experiments with a new system have not proved a success. Obviously while I've been experimenting I haven't been using any of the existing systems.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Good to hear from you!  I am sorry to hear that your new system has not worked out.  I have stayed with Autofocus and here recently back to AF4.  Autofocus works very well for me.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">My experience, too: while DWM seemed intriguing, the amount of shuffling back and forth through multiple notebooks made it too inconvenient.</div>
