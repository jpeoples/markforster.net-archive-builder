<div class="content">Probably it's  already been covered here, but anyway:<br><br>I have used SF for the last 5 days and one of the most interesting things to me has been some kind of productive procrastination. Usually, there is some task in C2 that I resist, so  some remaining C1 tasks suddenly seem attractive.<br><br>Example: <br>C2: Working on Thesis (high resistance)<br>C1: De-clutter Desktop (some resistance, but I's still more appealing)<br><br>And suddenly I have a clean workspace. Amazing! For the first time in months. In this way C2 resistance helps me (a lot) overcome C1 resistance. I think I haven't become faster at working on my Thesis but all this other stuff finally gets done. So relieving! I hope this effect will remain. Has anyone experienced the same effect?</div>

<div class="content">Hi BG, <br><br>I don't use SF so cannot really claim to know what I'm talking about :) <br><br>However, it looks like your C2 item 'Working on Thesis' does not sound like a task that has a clear completion criteria, for example 'complete first draft for tutor feedback'  (or an interim completion statement that makes sense to you) may serve to provide a more 'super' focus?  <br><br>Conversely, the entry 'Working on Thesis'  would appear to be better suited to C1 as it suggests a more 'little and often' approach that does not define any sort of completion criteria.<br><br>As I say, I'm no expert & all the best of luck with your thesis!</div>

<div class="content">Predefined scope for C2 unfinished items was the original mandate.  It has not however been universally accepted, and even Mark experimented with alternatives. Yet it's absolutely right for a project as big and important as a thesis; it helps to have more concrete goals.  It's motivating to approach the target and see progress.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your answers :)<br><br>I used to take the GTD Next Action approach... very well defined tasks.<br><br>But Mark's blog post on his completion of "War & Peace" made me think. The "little and often" approach appealed to me, combined with some urgency... and now I'm always having some kind of thesis related task in C2. <br><br>Currently, due to the mentioned high resistance, it is phrased: "Thesis > 10 Minutes" (I have an extra list for all thesis related tasks that I switch to.) This helps me to get started and do at least SOMETHING a couple of times each day. So far, this works.<br><br>And there is still enough resistance to get my room nice and clean XD<br><br>But I am still experimenting with the system and the phrasing of particular tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I also have Thesis as a Column 2 task. It's a big one, but it has a clear exit criteria (having it approved my committee). Of course, I also use the "I'll get the file out" trick extensively to work on it.<br><br>I've found it's effective to knowing how you'll even feel when you're finished, even if you don't know the exact details of what finished will be.</div>
