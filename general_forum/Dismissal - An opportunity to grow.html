<div class="content">Currently, Mark's suggestion regarding dismissal is: <br><br><<All tasks which are on pages earlier than today’s date have expired. They are dead, done for, dismissed, deceased.>><br><br>But I think there's an opportunity to learn/grow from dismissal. Sometimes tasks expire because they are no longer relevant. But often times it's good ol' resistance i.e. the tasks/projects that are most important to us are the one's we avoid (Pressfield, Sher, etc). <br><br>Also, DWM doesn't address how to reintroduce dismissed tasks - at least in an official way. I'd be curious to know how people handle this.</div>

<div class="content">Well for one I've never followed that rule for DWM, I only dismiss and never delete unactioned items more than a month old.  Each of the pages older than one month I have a diagonal line from lower left to upper right to indicate that it is a dismissed page.  I also have an item in my DWM that says "Review dismissed" to re-introduce dismissed items into DWM if needed be as new tasks.<br><br>However, I am happy to report that I have no unactioned items older than 20 days, and I have no dismissed items since I started DWM2 more than a month ago.  Remelsbach for tasks more than a week old really gets those pesky old items real good.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nuntym<br><br><< Well for one I've never followed that rule for DWM, >><br><br>Hm, I find that rule is (psychologically) key... for me anyway.<br><br>Anybody else?</div>

<div class="content">This happens to me a lot, although I don't formally dismiss things if I know I'll get back to them when the current crunch is over. Grabbing all the ones I remember doing before and getting them all going at once doesn't work.<br><br>After the current crunch and then vacation, I'm going to try a variation of Spinning Plates to get things going again.</div>

<div class="content">Since my current MoT system –<br><br><a href="../general_forum/Morsels of Time (MoT).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2316266</a><br><br>– works in the spirit of SMEMA –<br><br><a href="../blog/The Simplest and Most Effective Method of All.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/3/7/the-simplest-and-most-effective-method-of-all.html</a><br><br>– I don't really have any formal dismissal.  But I do maintain physical and virtual tickler files –<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickler_file" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickler_file</a><br><br>– and find that it's a great way to defer a task or project or idea to consider that, while perhaps important, isn't urgent. Rather than maintaining a bunch of items on a list that you aren't actioning, just "mail them to yourself " so that each will arrive at some future date for reconsideration.  There are probably many other clever ways to do this, for those who don't use a tickler file.  The essential thing is to get them off your list and out of your conscious mind for now.</div>

<div class="content">ubi et al.<br><br>It's all these tasks that one puts on one's todo list which one never gets round to which are stifling your productivity.<br><br>As I've said before, the DWM system was based on BBC iPlayer - unfortunately unobtainable outside the United Kingdom as far as I know - in which the programs can be downloaded onto your PC or Smartphone etc for 30 days, but once you start watching a program you only have 7 days before it's deleted automatically. <br><br>Once the program's gone - it's gone. There's no way of getting it back - ever!</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><<the DWM system was based on BBC iPlayer>><br><br>Renting movies from iTunes works in a similar way. <br><br>I love how you were able to extrapolate the assembly line idea from the BBC to DWM. Great stuff.</div>
