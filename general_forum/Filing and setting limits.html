<div class="content">Thanks for the references, Ian. Unfortunately a lot of the material about the Noguchi Filing System has been removed from the web since your link was originally posted. I've never been able to see quite how it would work in practice myself, but perhaps that's because I've only read summaries by people who may not understand the system properly themselves<br>Best wishes,<br>Mark</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the reply, Mark. The subject interested me because it included your idea of replacing files and books at the left hand end of the bookshelf. <br><br>Anyway I'm sticking with the lever arch files, simple and it works.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Ian</div>
