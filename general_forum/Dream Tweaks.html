<div class="content">After two months, the daily exercise of re-writing my future vision has become a chore. However the idea was inspiring i.e. an AM ritual to help focus my day, so I'm not giving up on it just yet. Here's what I'm thinking: <br><br>Following Brian Tracy's advice (re-write your top 10 goals a new, every day, without looking at the previous days list), combined with Tony Robbins suggestion to: "Visualize a successful day", I'm going to record myself describing my day AS IF it already happened. I will add emotion (a la Dreams), and do this daily. At the end of the week, on Friday, I will re-write my future vision. <br><br>In essence, this will provide me with an interesting journal (audio): <br><br>Morning: My ideal (future) day<br>Afternoon: Updated present reality<br>Night: Final update of present reality</div>

<div class="content">"How to Make Your Dreams Come True" advises re-writing the Future and Current Realities once a week, not once a day.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - <br><br>Recently, I thought you recommended re-typing/writing out the future reality once a day. Or am i missing something?</div>

<div class="content">Only for the first week or so until it stabilizes.</div>

<div class="content">Ah... didn't know that. <br><br>Anyway, I'm looking forward to trying out my hack... if for no other reason than to have an  audio journal of what I would have liked to happen vs what actually happened.</div>

<div class="content">A tweak I'm using is to have 2 aspects to the future vision: as well as the outer goals and accomplishments I have a section for my desired inner experience - my inner quality of living. This seems to decouple reliance on outer events or occasions to create the experience I want - it's quite liberating.</div>

But reviewing my notes from forum threads "PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH MARK'S: HOW TO MAKE YOUR DREAMS..." and "WHAT TO EXPECT INITIALLY FROM 'DREAMS'," I see that Mark did not actually say that.<br><br>What he did recommend boils down to this:<br>- The What's Better list is most important. Write it daily. He adds to his throughout the day.<br>- Rewriting the Vision (FV and PR) is next important. He rewrites his first thing in the morning (which I must have taken to mean daily, though evidently he meant daily or weekly as needed).<br>- Dialog is least important and the most troublesome for some people. Do it when you have some time or feel the need.<br><br>I also remember reading that the FV was rewritten in the morning, with the PR rewritten in the evening, but I cannot find that particular post.<br><br>Mark, am I on target with that summary? Has your thinking changed on any of these points?<br><br>For me, the "Dreams" process continues to pay off. Though it proceeds slowly, it is the most effective system I have ever followed for time/action management or goal setting. It is also the best-feeling system in that if I stop doing it for a few days, I always end up really *wanting* to get back to it, which may the biggest secret to its success.</div>

<div class="content"><<FV was rewritten in the morning, with the PR rewritten in the evening>><br><br>I know I do this. In the AM (and this is my tweak), I listen to an edited visualization exercise by Tony Robbins, and then audio record how I would like my day to end. I record my present reality twice: once at 2PM, the other before I go to sleep. <br><br><<Has your thinking changed on any of these points>> <br><br>For a while, Mark was on a roll re: Dreams. Is the momentum/PULL still oriented towards updating DREAMS? <br><br><<For me, the "Dreams" process continues to pay off. Though it proceeds slowly>><br><br>Yup, for me as well. I still have great difficulty staying in PULL... or knowing if I'm in PULL. I have a hunch that my vision needs some tweaking. As well, I'm re-reading Dreams.</div>
