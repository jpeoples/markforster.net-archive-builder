<div class="content">I switch systems every couple of days, moving from AF2 to FV to FFVP. This, of course, produces very shaky results at best. Have any of you found a way to avoid this chronic switching?</div>

<div class="content">Make a public commitment to stick to one system and do so. After about a week, you'll find the urge disappears. Remember that you can flex the system to fit your personality and what you need while still being the system.</div>

<div class="content">PerplexedPotato:<br><br>Well in fact you are only switching between two systems: AF2 and FFVP. This is because FV is within the rules of FFVP as I mention in my post at <a href="../blog/Change to Fast FVP.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2018/1/6/change-to-fast-fvp.html</a> (see the afternote).<br><br>Are you using the same list when you change systems? If you are not, I strongly advise that you do. Using the same list all the time will prevent the results being patchy. In fact there is nothing really wrong with what you are doing as long as you don't keep starting new lists.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br>That makes sense... Every time I switch, I make a new list... Wouldn't the FFVP mechanism ruin AF2 dismissal?<br>The thing I like about FV and FFVP is that they put pressure on old tasks. AF2 on the other hand puts pressure on urgent tasks. So I guess it would make sense to switch based on the circumstance.</div>

<div class="content">To be honest I'd forgotten that AF2 had a dismissal process, and I had to remind myself what it was. If you're switching regularly then it wouldn't really be necessary to use it since, as you say, FFVP puts pressure on old tasks. So I'd just ignore it, if I were you.</div>

<div class="content">How would FV or FFVP ruin AF2's dismissal? If a task is on notice, and you do not work on it in the next 24 hours, you dismiss it.<br><br>(I find hard dismissal systems that allow me to keep something active by working on it don't work for me. I do a bit of work on unimportant things just to keep them active, instead of accepting that I need to let them go.)</div>

In both FV and FFVP your aim is to work back to the root task. That may take some time, but you will always get there if you work the system properly.</div>
