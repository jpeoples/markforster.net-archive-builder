<div class="content">First, I'd like to thank you for your work.  I just received DIT and did my first read (of many) in just one day!  Your writing style is, as always very practical and engaging. The ideas and new way of thinking are refreshing.  <br><br>Unfortunately, I have a couple of points of confusion with which, perhaps, you could help me? <br><br>Q1: The task diary:  Do you travel with the task diary appointment to appointment or... does it live in one place, such as on yr desk, next to yr inbox? <br><br>Is the task diary  just for tasks/reminders-- a daily list? ---or is it also used for meeting notes, project planning, brainstorming, etc... What/how do you recommend capturing meeting notes, and other such things. (bound books? scrap paper?)<br><br>Q2: Your filing system is very intriguing to me, but i fear that the UK is far more advanced than the US in terms of diverse filing/binding mechanisms.  What is a "Lever Arch File"? Is there an american translation or equivalent? is there a source from which I might be able to attain these, in the US? <br><br>-with deep appreciation,<br>ms</div>

<div class="content">Dear ms<br><br>Thanks for your comment, and I am very glad you are finding "Do It Tomorrow" useful already.<br><br>I use my Task Diary purely for listing tasks and nothing else. I don't normally take it with me when I travel, because I am usually only referring to it when I am in my office. It just sits on my desk.<br><br>For meeting notes, I usually write them on paper on a clip board and then if I wish to I can file them on return to my office in the relevant file, or simply write up extracts.<br><br>You'll find a discussion about Lever Arch Files for Americans at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/10/4/file-for-success.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/10/4/file-for-success.html</a> (see the Comments)</div>
