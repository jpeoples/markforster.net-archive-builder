<div class="content">Hello <br>Best wishes to all here are my first step of implementation it works very well for me for the moment. <br><br>1. Use paper and pen<br>2. Make litte booklets you bend by half<br><br>3. Booklet one is for AF<br>- P1 = backlog<br>-P2 =active lis<br>-P3 = Call<br>-P4 =Wait<br>P5= commercial proposal (for me)<br><br>4. Booklet 2 is for list<br>P1 = Business list<br>P2 = Obligation (Taxes, accountant...)<br>P3 = Personnal <br>P4 = Someday may be list <br><br>5 Booklet 3 is for methods and cheklist - I am still working on it. <br><br>Simple isnt it ?

<div class="content">This is similar to what I'm doing, except instead of paper, pen and bendy notebooks, I use OneNote notebooks.  I work through my AF notebook and when I get to any item it refers me to a project notebook with details about the project (goals, next actions, etc.)</div>

<div class="content">re: OneNote I wasn't suggesting you use it.  Really, it's just Notebooks you can do exactly what I do with paper if you wanted to.<br><br>re: pocketmod link.  you don't need software, just scissors!  If you wanted to print your own, MS Word or such will work.  Except for the backwards sheets, it's as easy as selecting an 8-part template page (like Avery) to setup for printing, and then just design stuff in each part.</div>

<div class="content">Hi there is something which suits well better for me than one note it's evernote and you can keep it on your iphone !!! and that 's great . It's easy to use with AF4</div>

<div class="content">For a digital solution I would also recommend SimpleNote, which is a note-taking app for the iPhone that improves upon the built-in notes app and syncs with a website. SimpleNote can also be used in conjunction with Nottingham, which is a clone/redo of the incredible 'Notational Velocity', a note-taking app for the mac.<br><br>I don't use either for my primary AF4 list, but I use it for shopping lists, a quick inbox, and other assorted notes/tasks (either using the AF system, or just plain note-taking).</div>
