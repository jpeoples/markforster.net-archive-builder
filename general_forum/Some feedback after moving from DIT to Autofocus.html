<div class="content">While I've been using DIT for about a year and love it, I like Autofocus as well. The Home & Work task lists give me a good overview of tasks, and I like that low value tasks tend to be eliminated through attrition (i.e. dismissing tasks that never "jump out" at you). When started beta testing this Tuesday, I had just returned from a 2-week holiday followed by a 3 day illness - so I had LOTS to chuck at the system! <br><br>A couple of things I've noticed so far: <br>(1) Rather than keeping separate lists at home and at the office, I prefer to keep separate “Office” and “Home” lists together in one small notebook, which I carry with me. I often think of home items while at the office, and vice versa. Also, sometimes I can tackle the odd "home" item on my lunch break, and having the list handy makes it easy to pick out an item to complete. <br> <br>(2) I still like the DIT principles for tackling email. I run an agent in Lotus Notes that automatically moves "today's" emails to a "tomorrow" file. I feel more on top of email when I know what 1-days worth of email looks like, and it gives me a natural cut off for how much of it I need to process "today". If I don’t to this, I tend to have an inbox cluttered with hundreds of emails (I work in IT), and this feels overwhelming. <br> <br>(3) I still like to use some other aspects of DIT, e.g. grouping similar tasks in a block & clearing them at once, such as phone calls, emails, paper, etc., and find these blend well with Autofocus.<br><br>I'm not sure whether I'm processing more with Autofocus than with DIT - I'm keeping a log, so I should know that after I've run it for one full week. <br></div>
