<div class="content">Hello Mark, and fellow subscribers,<br><br>This is my first time on the site for a while, and I've been reading the blog posts on Autofocus feverishly over the past couple of days. However, I can't seem to determine whether the beta-testing is still available, or whether that particular ship has sailed on me!<br><br>I've been a devotee of Mark's methods for several years now - read all three books several times (particularly GTD and DIT) - and am desperate to participate in the Autofocus trial if possible. I've re-subscribed to the newsletter and ticked the beta box, yet haven't received anything on Autofucus.<br><br>Am I indeed too late? :-(</div>

<div class="content">Neil, I don't think you're too late to the party!  I'm sure Mark will add you to the list manually and send out the instructions if there was some glitch in the auto-send.<br><br>Autofocus has sure created some big improvements in my life, so hope the same is true for you! <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hello Neil: I just signed up for the beta, so it's not closed. Look for two emails, one which says "Welcome" and the second (the next day) which says "Autofocus Time Management System".<br><br>Be sure to check your spam filter, as that's probably where they are.</div>

<div class="content">I signed up and got my Welcome message last Monday morning, but the Autofocus email didn't arrive until Wednesday evening, so it can take some time to arrive.</div>

<div class="content">Ah, great - thanks, all.<br><br>I think I'm a victim of my own impatience!<br><br>:-)</div>

<div class="content">Neil:<br><br>The instructions are sent out on a daily basis, so if you don't receive them tomorrow at the latest please get back to me.</div>

<div class="content">I am in the same boat -- after being away at term break, I have returned to find news of Autofocus -- which appears from what I can tell to be nearly tailor made for my needs.  And, as I am in the final year of a PhD and headed into the writing phase --and prone to go days at a time without being very productive, despite my enthusiasm for DIT --I sure could use Autofocus in my life!<br><br>Mr Forster, please, please let me in the Beta-test!<br><br>Sinecerly, Mark Elder</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Be sure to read the threads having to do with writing.  There is some good advice on writing there and some of it may apply to your thesis work.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, the Autofocus beta testing is still open to new subscribers. All you have to do is enter your email address in the Newsletter sign-up box in the right hand margin.<br><br>What happens then depends on whether you are already a subscriber to my newsletter:<br><br>If you are not, then you will see a couple of tick boxes, one for my normal newsletter and one for the Beta Testing. Make sure you tick the Beta Testing one and submit. You can of course tick both if you wish.<br><br>If you are, then you will see a message saying you will receive an email with instructions on how to change your sign up details. Press Submit and follow the instructions in the email when you receive it.</div>
