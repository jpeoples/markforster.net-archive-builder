<div class="content">If I missed this point, please ignore me. <br><br>In all the other versions of AF, the first action to be taken each day, or when you have been away from the list for a while, was to read all the entries before starting to take any actions. Did I miss seeing this step in the instructions? Is the step dropped? Is it not mentioned since the instructions are 'preliminary' and meant for those who are familiar with AF?<br><br>Thanks.<br>Terri</div>

<div class="content">Terri,<br>Based on Mark's recent demonstration, you just start wherever on the list you stopped last time. There is no need to read through all of them beforehand, unless you are worried about forgetting something urgent. You will be re-reading all of the ones in the Closed List soon enough as you go.</div>
