<div class="content">I'm certain this has been covered before but in searching the archive I didn't find an answer. My question is -- if I have a list of about 9 active pages, what is the very first thing I do every morning? <br>Do I<br>a) resume working on the page I was on at the end of the day yesterday (assuming I remember what page I was on)<br>OR<br>b) do i start at the first page and work my way through my active pages one list at a time<br>OR<br>c) do I start with a task that I know is important to be done today -- and then work the other items on that page and move forward from there.<br>OR<br>d) some other idea that I haven't thought of.<br><br>Any guidance on this question would be most welcome!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve,<br><br>The instructions say to continue where you left off ... don't do anything special.  We all have our special tweaks and mine is to scan the list in its entirety at the end of the day to prime my subconscious ... I've always done that, no matter what system I used.  Likewise, I've always scanned my list first thing in the morning to see if there are any gotchas on it.  But then I still pick up where I left off last time.<br><br>Sunday is always my big planning day and I do that over morning coffee.  So I'd have to say that on Sunday, since I make lots of changes to my list, schedule, ideas about projects I want to work on, etc, that I break the cycle and start over at the top of the list.  I guess, in my view, it is really a different list after my planning ("review", in GtD terms) session.</div>

<div class="content">If you have 9 active pages I would suggest a quick read through the full list first. Then continue from where you left off yesterday or, if there is something urgent that needs doing, address the urgent item and then continue from where you left off yesterday<br><br>There have been several suggestions for marking where you are upto in the lists: using an index card as a bookmark, marking the item you are working on with a paperclip and using a post-it sticky note<br><br>I use a small sticky note to mark where I am up to - it is half clear (so I can read through it) and half bright purple so stands out on the page easily<br><br>Hope this helps</div>
