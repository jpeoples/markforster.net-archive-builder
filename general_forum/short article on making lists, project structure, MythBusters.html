<div class="content">this is almost too simple. interesting comments, as they find it useful. worth noting in my often overdone attempt to perfectly organize project manage everything. this guy is doing alot, with a very simple system.<br><br><a href="http://www.wired.com/design/2012/10/adam-savage-make-a-list/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/design/2012/10/adam-savage-make-a-list/</a></div>

<div class="content">Further thoughts: Adam displays many characteristics of ADHD -- yet he's clearly successful. I need to send my son that article. People with ADHD might need to use lists and plans when things are simple enough that most people don't need them -- but those of us who admit it and learn to use them early then have an advantage over those who haven't yet learned.<br><br>In an interview several years ago (either Nerdist or Geek-A-Week), Adam discussed what it takes to get, and keep, a job in special effects.<br><br>First, don't bring a book of drawings. Bring a box of models. I want to see what you've done, not what you've planned.<br><br>Second, if you are asked to paint 100 fiddly things, then you do it. You don't wander off to find another task just because you're bored.<br><br>One of the things I loved about MythBusters, which they've gotten away from, is the planning. Back before they were known, the phone calls and scavenging trips were great. Keep calling until you get a lead, then follow that lead. Use what you have and adapt. Remember what's there, so next time you need something similar you know where to go.<br><br>Too many kids these days think that designing something on the computer is the same as building it in the real world.</div>

<div class="content">I like this Adam Savage project management. As simple as ...<br>(1) Put everything for a project in one folder<br>(2) When they get too much, sort them into subfolders<br>(3) When you start doing the project, have a "progress" subfolder<br>... that's it. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Alan, no prob. :-)<br><br>Another thought for step 2 "sort into subfolders". I found in many cases "time buckets" folders is more than sufficient sorting for me. I usually use yearly or monthly folders . Weekly or daily folders tends to contain too little stuff.<br><br>Sorting by "time" is almost as friction free as halving sort that Mark suggests <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1040153#post1042196" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1040153#post1042196</a> .</div>
