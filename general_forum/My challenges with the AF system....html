<div class="content">I have been using the AF system since January 5th.  Overall, I am very happy with the system and am FAR more productive than I was before I adopting Autofocus.  However, I have a few problems with the system...  I am open to advice from the group on how I can better adapt AF to meet my needs.<br><br>I generally have about 10 active pages at any given time.  I NEVER make it through all of the pages in a given day even though I have quite a bit of discretionary time during which I am using AF (I don't have a lot of meetings or appointments or even a specific schedule).  My problem is that my BIG projects aren't getting done and my personal contacts (emails and phone calls) are falling by the wayside.  I used to respond to emails in a much more timely fashion, but now often days go by without my responding to those messages which require more than a brief response.  I have a few large projects on my list which will likely take several days to be completed.  At the rate I am going, I won't have them finished for months (I do about an hour or so when I get to these items on my list and feel like doing them - that isn't always the case) and that won't work for me!  <br><br>Any suggestions on how I might better use AF for large projects and personal contacts?  In the past, I would "white-knuckle" my way through such things by including these items on a daily MUST list and attaching rewards to finishing them or doing something for a certain period of time.  I really can't dismiss these items because they are truly important!<br><br>I hope I was clear enough for some people to help.  If not, please ask me questions.  I have only posted a few times on the forum but I have "lurked" quite a bit and read many, many other posts.  I know there is a lot of wisdom here!<br><br>AF has worked for me better than anything else in the past.  If I can get it to work better for these specific issues, I will be thrilled beyond belief!<br><br>Many thanks to Mark and all of you, Debbie</div>

<div class="content">Hi Debbie<br><br>Firstly don't worry that you're not making it through your lists at least once a day, that in itself is not a major problem, but do make sure that you are at least reviewing all of the items regularly so that you know what is in there.  However, if you only have ten active pages and are not going through that number, and, given what you say about larger tasks, it sounds likely that you are spending fairly large time blocks on some tasks and also that some of these are not standing out as clearly or as frequently as you would wish.  Again, that in itself is not a problem but it is something that needs to be looked at, as there is generally a reason.<br><br>A couple of suggestions - <br><br>1 - make sure that you are putting a number of smaller items on your lists.  eg Check schedule, check blog, Thinking Time, shredding, check email.  I personally would recommend adding check email to each page - at least once!  Having smaller items also gets you started on a page and gets momentum going.<br><br>2 - Thinks about rephrasing larger tasks or including just the smaller steps of those projects<br><br>3 - Use some of Thinking Time to look at those tasks/projects and see if you can identify your feelings towards them - that may identify the reason for resistance.  For example I was speaking to a friend on this very issue yesterday and, despite knowing the rules, she identified that she was still focusing on doing the project in total rather than part of it, and therefore it was the difficulty or size of the task that was causing the resistance.<br><br>Hope some of that helps - oh, and I also find that, for me, writing down my thoughts during my Thinking Time helps me to somehow get them in order.  Never a bad thing! :-)<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Debbie,<br><br>If you have 10 active pages and your pages are about 30 items each then that means you have 300 items in front of you.  Is that about right?<br><br>One problem seems to be that you are not moving through the list fast enough so that you don't see everything on your entire list each day.  If that is accurate, then the solution is to move faster.  One thing you might try it altering the rule such that you work on ONLY one item on a page and then MUST move to the next page.  Christine suggested rewording the items so that they take less time ... that accomplishes the same thing ... you will move through the list faster.<br><br>Another way to move through the list faster is to have bigger pages.  IOW, if you have 60 items on a page rater than 30, you will be seeing twice as many things each time you scan a page so it will be more likely that you will see the things you are not seeing now (like email).<br><br>Another question comes to mind.  If you are working X hours on the list and moving slowly, are you getting important things done?  IOW, maybe you are moving at the right pace given what you have on your plate.  If your list has lots of big (hours long) projects on them, maybe you just have more to do than you have time in the day.  Possible?<br><br>OTOH, you say that your BIG projects are not getting done.  So what IS getting done?  IOW, if you are moving through the list slowly and you are not getting the big things done where is your time going?  Perhaps you could try keeping a time log for a few days to see where your time is really going.  It may turn out that you are not spending time where you thing you are.<br><br>Another alternative is to block big chunks of time for the big projects and work on them outside of AF.  It could be that certain things work better for you outside of AF.  Again, just a thought.<br><br>As to email and phone calls, those might better be removed from AF entirely.  IOW, have a routine or habit to return calls at 10:00am each day and answer email at 12:00pm each day.  That will assure that they get done regularly.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I struggled with the same problem as you, DebbieR.  I have 18 active pages right now, and I typically work on 5 pages per day.  I also have a lot of discretionary time.  I have a number of large projects -- some externally generated (e.g. boss, $$$ stuff), some self-generated (e.g. Learn Objective-C, Be a better listener).<br><br>My solution was to refine the definition of "discretionary".  These projects are not discretionary, so they don't go into the AF list.  I set aside a block of time (like Mike suggested) each day for The Projects.<br><br>I also value giving prompt replies to emails and calls, so that's not discretionary for me.  They go on the calendar, usually first or last thing of the day -- where I can trust myself to remember them.<br><br>This approach feels comfortable to me.  I don't need AF to help me produce better decisions on The Projects or emails -- I've already decided to do them -- during the hours I set aside for them.  If I procrastinate and don't work on them (in effect making them discretionary again!), I would move them into AF.</div>

<div class="content">Is it possible you simply have too much work to do (i.e. you're not saying "no" to enough things and simply not entering them at all)?<br><br>After all, no matter what the system, and no matter the skills/motivation/energy of the person, there is a maximum volume of incoming tasks in any given time that can be handled before buffers overflow and everything crashes. No?<br></div>

<div class="content">@Tommy - Yes, you can only do so much.  But ordinarily this doesn't crash AF.  What happens is that you dismiss things that really aren't as important as you thought they were -- you realize you just don't have time for them, since you have other priorities that are more important.<br><br>One way you *can* crash AF is to fill it with so many items that you can't cycle through the pages fast enough -- when (average daily number of new pages) > (average number of pages you can get through in a day).  If that happens, you rarely or never visit your original pages for a second time, let alone multiple times, so you never even have the opportunity to dismiss them.  <br><br>I was having this very problem when I first started with AF.  I just had way too much stuff.  But upon reflection, I realized that the main cause was that I had copied over everything from my old systems -- Toodledo, Outlook, project folders, etc. -- and was continually copying over new stuff as a repeating item.  I got up to 50+ pages, with no tasks dismissed.  I was always adding more tasks than I was completing.  I had well over 1000 active tasks, with few duplicates.<br><br>For me, the solution to this dilemma was to start fresh with a new list, and *not* start this new list by copying stuff over.  Instead, I started the new list by writing down everything that was on my mind, everything that was really pressing on me.  And then I also wrote down "copy stuff from old lists", but when I do that, I do it more selectively.  My lists are now "lean and mean" and the system works very effectively for me.</div>

<div class="content">First of all, I would like to say a BIG thank you to all those who replied to my question!  Your suggestions are very helpful and I plan to try many of them.<br><br>In response to Tommy, I don't really think I have too much to do.  I only work part-time, but I am also a student taking several demanding classes and do quite a bit of volunteer work as well.  I truly feel that I SHOULD be able to get it all done!  I AM getting SO much more done with AF than before I started AF.  Without AF, I might have dropped one of my classes because I wasn't getting the homework done...  I do plan to cut back on my volunteer work in about a month (I have some outstanding commitments in that regard), so that should help me.  I have also tried to get started earlier in the day so I have more time to work on AF.  That helps considerably, but I don't always do it!  <br><br>The suggestions which I found particularly helpful and already started to try are:<br><br>1) Set aside project time each day.  I started to do this with my classwork and I am now mostly caught up after being fairly far behind last week.<br><br>2) Include smaller items on my list AND include "check email" on each page at least once.  I find I do check email too often (it can be addictive), but I don't count the quick glances as having worked on that task.  But I do spend time going through my in-box and making replies more regularly since listing that task on each page.<br><br>3) Break down large projects into smaller tasks to reduce resistance.  I haven't tried this one yet, but am going to start it today.  I am not sure why I am so resistant to some things.  It's often because I don't know HOW to do those things and hate feeling incompetent, so I work on things at which I DO feel competent.  I realize, though, with AF, that I just have to START on the project and that counts!  <br><br>I also plan to implement Mike's suggestion of keeping a time log for at least a few days.  This week, I've had more appointments than usual, which are a huge time sink... I will do the time log next week and see if it helps to provide some insight.  <br><br>I am very grateful to those who gave me suggestions.  I am also grateful to have found AF!  I look at the forum regularly (it's on my list) but don't post much.  I find that just reading the posts is very helpful and I often don't have much to add.  <br><br>Okay, now back to my list :-)  Debbie</div>

<div class="content">Hi Debbie<br><br>Your comment "I am not sure why I am so resistant to some things. It's often because I don't know HOW to do those things and hate feeling incompetent, so I work on things at which I DO feel competent." is something I found to be very true also.  With AF there came a point at which the reasons for resistance suddenly started to become clear. I think for me that had a lot to do with changing the way I looked at tasks, either from looking at the task as a whole to the consituent parts, or conversely identifying the fact that a small task actually was part of something else that had resistance.  Once that process began, it became clearer as to whether there was genuine or merely phantom resistance.</div>
