<div class="content">Scenario:<br><br>First, assume I'm not on the last page. Assume also that there are at least two "stand out" tasks on the current page.<br><br>So, I do a pass down the page. I spot one of the "stand out" items and get to work.<br><br>I'm working away happily but suddenly notice the clock. Oh, it's late; I have to go home! But I'd like to pick up tomorrow from where I left off. So, what do I do?<br><br>Default AF would have me cross out my task on the current page, and write it down again at the end of the last page. But then tomorrow, when I do my pass of the page, I'll find one of the other "stand out" items (remember, there were at least two). So I'm forced to do that when I'd really like to work more on the original task. Now I won't get to that task again until I reach what is currently the last page.<br><br>For now my workaround is to use an index card, as was suggested for urgent tasks. I write down on the index card the task I want to continue with tomorrow. The card gets inserted as a bookmark into the current page. I could probably cross out the task on the current page now, but I don't have to. If I leave it in after completing it, I'll either spot it later (and cross it out), or eventually dismiss it (because, being complete, it won't ever stand out again).<br><br>Note: this is not about *having* to complete the task tomorrow (or by any other date). That, I assume, should be dealt with in a calendar or other date/time-sensitive system. Instead it's just about me *wanting* to keep my momentum.<br></div>

<div class="content">When tomorrow comes, maybe you'll find that things have changed and an entirely different set of items is now standing out.  Maybe you'll have subconsciously processed things and now you're "ready" to do some *other* tasks.  And maybe the task you are midway through today, and is attracting your attention right now, will offer significant resistance in the morning.<br><br>So, I'd recommend that you just go ahead and trust the system and see what happens.<br><br>I also went through all kinds of "what if..." scenarios when I first started with AF.  Eventually I found that it works best just to work the system as designed.  But it can take a few weeks before you trust the system that much.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Tommy<br><br>It is recommended when you leave your AF list that you pick up from where you left off.  I believe Mark mentioned that he starts the cross out line when he starts the item so he knows where he was.  The instructions are to work on the task "for as long as you feel like".  Therefore I would say that when you return to your page, at the same point the following day, if you feel like continuing that item then you would do so, crossing it off when completed and moving on.  If at that time you no longer feel like working on it then just cross it off, relist if appropriate, and move on. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">I think Christine has it just about right.  <br><br>But I think when you come back to AF on a new day, you should start as a clean look on the page.  First scan it and then go through each item one by one until one stands out.  If it is the one from yesterday, fine.  Continue working on it.<br><br>If not, I guess the right thing is to line it out and rewrite it at the end.  The alternative is to leave it on the same page.  But I don't think that is in keeping with the AF concept.  Adding it back at the end helps keep it fresh and does reflect the work you actually did. I have done it both ways (sometimes even after just a short interruption) and I think that it should go to the end of the list if you don't immediately start back on it.<br><br>This technique will work best if you do start the cross-out line or put a dot at the beginning to each item as you start to work on it.  That way you will notice it when you scan the page.  Mark does mention that technique in the video and  I think it should be added to the instructions.  (I often have trouble finding the item to cross out even if it has only been a few minutes that I worked on it.)</div>
