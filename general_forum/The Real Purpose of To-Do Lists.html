<div class="content"><< You might think the purpose of a to-do list is to remind you what to do. And it can be useful in that way. But that is not its primary purpose. The main function of the daily to-do list is to give the procrastinator the experience of checking off tasks as they are finished. Putting a check in the box next to the item, or crossing it out with a flourish, gives one a little psychological lift. It helps us to think of ourselves as doers, accomplishers, and not just lazy slugs. >><br><br>—John Perry, The Art of Procrastination</div>

<div class="content">Once again, Seraphim, you and I are thinking about the same topic at the same time. Great minds, I guess!<br><br>I find it difficult to pigeonhole the to-do list into one singular purpose. I find the Reminder function of a list at least as helpful as the Positive Reinforcement function of checking off an item. However, those of us who have followed Mark for a while know that the list also serves as a means to compare the relative value of tasks so that we can determine the best activity right now.<br><br>I have been following «Dreams» for a couple of months now, and I have to say that if I want some *real* positive reinforcement, I describe the success in my journal (as myself), and then switch roles to my "inner coach" and write a note of congratulations. Your mileage may vary, but I think it's worth a shot.</div>

I couldn't tell from the quote, but he advocates to do lists. <br>He recommends writing a list the night before of the first few things to do after wake in the morning. I often put this on my daily list, but perhaps it would be good to make a separate list.<br><br>He also recommends breaking tasks down into smaller subtasks, and admits that it would make the daily list pretty detailed.  This is what I am doing, but I find that my daily lists are getting to sometimes 100 items, and I am thinking that I need to reduce them.<br><br>I think with all the advice we receive around this subjects, that there is a limit to have far to take any advice - that the list can get too long, that we need breaks from a list, that we don't need to follow a list all the time.</div>

<div class="content">I've been thinking similarly.  I'm starting to value engagement over efficiency with my "to-do" systems.</div>

<div class="content">"The main function of the daily to-do list is to give the procrastinator the experience of checking off tasks as they are finished."<br><br>While that is definitely a valuable feature of the to-do list, the main function to me is that if I don't see the item on the list, or even if there is no list, I tend not to do the thing.<br><br>It's not that I need to see the items, but I need to be thinking of them, and reading (or writing to) a list of items is what gets me there.<br><br>Yes, the list needs to be kept short, as to my mind a long list is clutter, and clutter is a thing I prefer to avoid.  (Only my tendency is to hide myself from the clutter, rather than reduce it; something that needs to be combatted.)</div>

<div class="content">I meant the ebook on Google Play. It is 113 pages, so it should be a short read.</div>

<div class="content">Wow, I am kind of astonished at the number of responses!<br><br>I think the author's comments on the purpose of a to-do list were tongue-in-cheek, although with a point.  Kind of like his whole book.  :)<br><br>I just thought it was funny.  :)<br><br>(And I love how Asana sends flying unicorns and other things across your screen whenever you mark something done hahaha)</div>

<div class="content">If I saw unicorns flying across my todo list, although it would be pleasant, it would likely distract me into a rabbit hole of thinking about unicorns and related things!</div>
