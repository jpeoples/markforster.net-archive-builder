<div class="content">I have a tweak. Actually two. Hopefully they’ll be of help to someone.<br><br>I’ve always had a problem with dismissing items. I hate the finality of saying “I am not going to do that”, and sometimes I’m sure a dismissed task is actually one I both want to do and need to do, but for whatever reason (usually time, or expense, or both) has not come “ripe”.<br><br>I also struggled with highlighting dismissed tasks, as to me (am very visual), a highlighted task suggests an urgent task, not one I can afford to ignore for the time being.<br><br>I have therefore taken to crossing out dismissed items, (as I would a completed task), and re-writing them on the back page of my Autofocus notebook. Every Friday, I review the dismissed items, so I always know what’s on my peripheral radar, but now that they’re no longer visible on my active pages, they aren’t the distraction they used to be.<br><br>NB I don’t dismiss items that are out of context, just those that are not practical, possible, or sufficiently urgent for me to do in the immediate future. (I’m guessing everyone’s natural timeline is different, but my “immediate future” is about eight weeks. YMMV.)<br><br>My second tweak is one to aid resistance. It works on the principle that a hardened procrastinator (moi!) will always choose the least challenging task on their active page. <br><br>Opposite my most recent active page, I will write a whole page (approx 25 lines in my notebook) listing the task I am resisting over and over (like writing lines at school, not that I used to do that much, ahem). I find it works best when it incorporates a timeframe eg “work on Semiotics paper for twenty minutes”. <br><br>I treat the double page spread of tasks as one closed list. <br><br>So, to give you an idea, on my current active page I have items like “scrub bathroom floor”, “iron 7 shirts for week ahead” “collect parcels at post-office”, and “find new cleaner”. Faced with tasks like that, who wouldn’t prefer to spend fifteen minutes working off the opposite page, tackling that Semiotics paper bit by bit?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi little b<br><br>The AF rules specify dismissing "all" remaining items on a page if nothing stands out.  If you dismiss items on an active page before that final closure then it may well have an impact on the flow of reading the page and make it distracting.  You are better to wait until you dismiss the entire page (or perhaps you will find that you end up actioning the tasks instead).</div>

<div class="content">I've been "pre-dismissing" from the very beginning - I think it might depend on whether the entry came from a brain dump or not - I used to have a lot of those. :-)  I haven't noticed any disruption in the flow, and I don't even review my dismissed items.  I did at first because others suggested it, but I don't want to review old stuff, I want to focus on now.  If they're important enough, they'll come up again naturally.  <br><br>FWIW little b, I usually consider a time frame when dismissing - "am I willing to work on this project in the next 30 days?"   (I just use 30 days because that's about my average time for closure of a new page.)</div>

<div class="content">FWIW,  I also dismiss tasks whenever I know I'll not do them ... I don't wait for the whole page to be ready.  This is particularly true if the need to do the item has vanished.  I was going to call someone about a check they owed me and put it on the AF list.  The check then came in the mail so I crossed off "Call whoever" from the list.  I also crossed off my tickler list "Check from whoever due xx/xx".  Nice to be able to cross off two things while doing nothing at all ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark created some other term--which escapes me for the moment--for items that we decide not to do. For this post, I will call them "cancelled." It is not very unusual for me to cancel an item even when there are still open items on a page. I look at an item and decide that I no longer wish to do the item or I am no longer able to do the item. As far as I am concerned, canceling and dismissing are functionally identical. One has a single item on a page with other open items as its object. The other has all the items on a page as its object.</div>

<div class="content">little b,<br><br>like you I find dismissal very difficult and have right from the start developed something similar to you. I don't actually highlight dismissed items, since I can find that distracting (either if I am working on the page opposite, or if the highlighter shows through), but rather write all dismissed items into a list at the back of the notebook, from where they may be returned one day. I call this my "Someday" list (something I added to DIT when I was using that). I don't look at it very frequently, maybe once a month, and funnily enough, so far have never returned anything back to the main list. So in the end its just a security blanket for me.<br><br>Jacqueline,<br><br>I have been doing exactly the same, from the beginning, often because I find that the item is no longer relevant, or doesn't need to be done any more. I don't bother moving these to the Someday list, as I regard the task as cancelled, rather than dismissed, but do put a "C" next to them just to give me some idea of how many tasks I am entering that  don't ultimately need to be done. Its quite a few, which I find interesting.</div>

<div class="content">I have the same problem with dismissing tasks in AF. <br><br>I found another solution when at the first pass the item jump at me and say NO I wont do that i just put a ∅ just in front to it with mean dismissed.<br><br>Then when i read this item i just jump to the next one for it is dismissed. <br><br>In the morning in read all my list and i put others ∅ in front of items or i cross them at the first pass with a paper pen so i can erase the ∅ later...</div>

<div class="content">I do something similar with dismissed items (or actually canceled items as well):<br>I write a "x" through the checkbox (instead of a check mark) and if I think this is something I might do later I write the item on a A4 size piece of paper and put it into my tickler file system, e.g. for next month or beginning of next quarter or ...<br>When my tickler file than "throws it out" again I consider whether and when I might do it. I might put the piece of paper into the bin, or defer it again or write the task into my AF book again (and throw the paper into the bin as well).</div>
