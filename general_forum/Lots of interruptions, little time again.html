<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-5 3:10</div>
<div class="content">My previous attempt at this thread was interrupted by discussions on managing work volume, among other topics :-/. I try again. <br><br>In principle there's no reason life or a job can't succeed in situations with lots of interruptions and little time, but SF might get unbalanced without a great deal of care.  For one, it's hard to get back on track.  For another, it's hard to keep those interruptions from dominating so that your priority work gets scant attention. II gather it's a common situation, so please share: how do you cope? How can systems help?</div>

<div class="content">I wouldn't claim to have a complete  answer to this, but it certainly helps if you make a point of writing down everything on the list before actually taking action. Just putting a  buffer between trigger and reaction doesn't stop you being disturbed, but does stop you getting completely diverted into unnecessary actions.</div>

<div class="content">That could get awkward - 'hold on Boss, I can't answer you until I write down that you're interrupting me and I decide if answering now 'stands out' per AF/SF/DWM rules" :)</div>

<div class="content">I'm sure she'll respect you all the more, and realise that you are ready for the next promotion!<br><br>Seriously, even if you can't block the interruptions themselves, it is worth writing down any actions rather than dropping everything. And you should be able to ask even your boss whether she wants you to drop everything.</div>

<div class="content">It's not only the boss that interrupts. Also colleagues, customers, supplier, salesmen, subordinates. And even if it's someone whom you are obliged to attend to, the interruption may be something you can note and get to later. Listen, take notes, manage your commitments.</div>

<div class="content">Personally I have found SF (and AF, and DWM) to be great helps in managing interruptions.  No, I don't write down the interruptions themselves -- what's the point of that?   But any tasks that get generating during the interruption, yes I do write those down while my boss or my wife or my coworker waits for me to write it down.  <br><br>My wife even says, before she starts saying anything, "Do your have your notebook?  I need you to write some things down on your list."   :-)<br><br>If my boss or my wife wants to actually do something during the interruption, like look at a website or go over a project or something, then of course I just do it with them right then.  <br><br>The SF lists are for discretionary time.   If you're meeting with another person, whether it's planned or spontaneous, it's not discretionary time.</div>

<div class="content">I think will has a point.<br><br>Moreover, interruptions can be (in most cases) limited a great deal. There is a universal truth about human nature that we feel the need to be needed. It gives a purpose to our existence and this is why it is sooo hard to say no or to undo behaviors that invite interruptions.<br><br>So I think the first step is to understand that we feel satisfaction at being interrupted even though it might be irritating. Then, it is possible to shift that sense of being needed from there to actual value in terms of effectiveness of work for example.<br><br>This discussion might be interesting but I suggest that we tackle the sources of interruption one by one because they have very little in common on the way to reduce them. If I may, start the ball on this, I'd choose emails.<br><br>I have done 2 things for my emails that have reduced the inflow dramatically (90%). But before you can apply it, you have to go over the feeling that it is not acceptable behavior and that you will loose people's respect with that. YOU are responsible for what other's expectation is of how you treat their email. Don't be ruled by other's expectation of you! If you consistently do it a way, they will expect that, only the change from now to the new way will unbalance a few.<br><br>First, I put an auto-responder that says that their email has been queued and will be answered just before 12:00pm or 5:00pm. If it is really urgent, they can find me at my phone. This gives people an out if it was really urgent and also makes them think twice before calling me. If they call and was not urgent, I tell them I will get to it when I review the emails. After that people EXPECT me to act like that so they will re-ajust their use of emails towards me.<br><br>The second thing is tied to the first. Since I do my emails towards 11:30am and 4:30pm, I have 30 minutes before lunch or I leave work so I don't linger on them. I make it brief and to the point. If the want a discussion, they can schedule a meeting. I also put this at the end of the email because it is invariably 5 lines or less even to my boss (including salutations and what not):<br><br>Q: Why is this email 5 sentences or less?<br>A: <a href="http://five.sentenc.es" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://five.sentenc.es</a></div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-6 5:54</div>
<div class="content">That auto responder would probably get me fired, Erik. My email is managed by switching off any alert mechanisms and allowing the task to stand out.<br><br>All other types of interruptions are off book; I deal with the phone calls, colleagues or bosses that call on me, then write the commitments arising from those interruptions into the notebook.<br><br>If the action requires immediate attention, it goes into C2 of the same page. The task I was working on disappears to the C2 of the next active page. Sometimes, that creates unease, because the matter I was working on is urgent as well. If its really uncomfortable for me to see the current task go, I classify it as urgent and enter it into C2 of the same page.<br><br>But something's gotta give: if the interruption creates a major commitment which eats into my time, I've got to be realistic. Move the task I was working on to C2 to another page, and inform the person I am working with that the deliverable will face delays. <br><br>Everything can't be urgent if it is likely to occupy more that the finite time I have at work. I've gotta bump off one urgent task for another. That how I manage my C2 task build-up and the expectations of others.</div>

<div class="content">I consider "email" to be a C2 task, which I do in batch:<br><br>1.drag contents of inbox to "WIP" folder, viewed by conversation<br>2. check each conversation in turn and note actions required<br>3. drag contents of WIP folder to 2011(x) reference folder<br><br>This is separate from a quick scan for any messages TO me alone, flagged urgent and messages from key clients, which are in a separate search folder.</div>

<div class="content">I find a common question around the office is "did you get my email?".  Usually the answer is no and that's because people aren't always checking email. I wonder if that sort of thing can be reduced.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-6 22:37</div>
<div class="content">Erik, looking at your five sentences rule for email I think that could be a very long email because some people can just go on and on without pausing for breath even for a second so that one sentence can be extremely long, let along five sentences which could be just about as long as War and Peace (ha, ha!) and it would take a very long time to read and would gum up your email for ever, or at least as long as an email with lots and lots of sentences would - and of course we are always looking for ways of getting round rules (just look at how everyone is trying to get round the rules for SF3) and it just seems to be a common human failing to make rules which are designed to be to make something short and sweet into something which is really long and boring - not that I ever would be writing anything long and boring, that's for sure.<br><br>Well, anyway, that was just one sentence and I can't be bothered to write five whole sentences because it would take me just for ever and I have better things to do like watch the tv and have a sleep, because I dont intend to let all this time management stuff get in my way of doing nothing, so I guess ill just have to pretend to be all busy and productive like and also pretent that I dont waste my time writing silly emails like this one instead of getting on with my work - and that really is enough and I've only used two sentences out of my ration of five so you can see what it might end up looking like, but I won't put you all through that, youll be pleased to hear, so good night and sweet dreams.</div>

The culture of the place you work in has to explicitly say that emails are more important then other stuff or alleviate email related overhead.<br><br>My 2 cents.</div>

<div class="content">C'mon folks, if we can post on here multiple times a day, with posts longer than 5 sentences, are externally imposed interruptions and long emails really that big a deal?<br><br>Internal psychological resistance may be the more likely culprit of scant attention paid to priority work.</div>

<div class="content">OhNiners wrote:<br><<< Internal psychological resistance may be the more likely culprit of scant attention paid to priority work. >>><br><br>I agree with you, OhNiners.  Interruptions and hundreds of emails to deal with each day are just part of life, for me at least, and they don't really bother me.   I struggle more with "internal psychological resistance", which is driven (at least in part) by having so many different things to do, that I can't choose or prioritize effectively without some kind of system for helping me do it.<br><br>This is a big reason I am striving to find a way to use SF with a large task load, because SF does such a great job helping to break down that resistance and the mental habits that create it.</div>
<h2>Reply by Erik</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-7 9:36</div>
<div class="content">OhNiners:<br><br>I agree with you 100% in that scant attention to priority work comes from internal psychological resistance. But the topic of this thread is how to deal with lots of interruptions... My only point about the 5 sentences is simply to re-negociate how you engage (your internal commitment) with your emails as being interruptions.<br><br>Just saying that it is safer to go by plane doesn't reduce the fear of flying. The fear is psychological and you can't defeat it with rationalization. You can defeat it by action and exposure to what it really is and how you choose to act in face of it...<br><br>Again, my 2 cents.</div>

<div class="content">Sounds to me Seraphim that you've got it the wrong way round. You want SF3 to break down your psychological resistance by finding ways to get it to handle a big task load. But to me it looks like your biggest psychological resistance is to reducing your task load.<br><br>I remember going to one of mark's lectures years ago and I remember him saying  you wouldnt believe how protective people can be of their work load. Theres nothing theyll resist more than the idea that they shoudl do an audit of what theyre doing. And the reason is that they are using being busy as a excuse for not being effective. If you take away the workload they suddenly have no excuse and its very frightening..<br><br>I found the note I made at the time so I'm not just making this up.</div>

<div class="content">Some very good points coming up about pschological pressures being a problem. But please don't disrupt this thread with further talk about work overload (even though there's value in that discussion). There's plenty of other threads on that topic. I agree that self-distraction is an important factor to overcome. <br><br>There is however also a point where it's good to be able to work solidly at a task for 45 minutes without disturbances. I Strongly disagree that responding to or even noticing email within an hour is important. Rather, It's a bad idea in most jobs unless the job is primarily communication.  It's good to develop patience and be able to function without instant answers.</div>

<div class="content">Well Alan do you think there might be a reason why your thread about interrruptions keeps getting interrupted by people wanting to talk about workload? Is it just possible that the two might be connected in some way?</div>

<div class="content">Only in that they are two different aspects of getting work under control. Here I see you addressing Seraphim about reducing commitment like you have in other threads.  I've seen that advice, and I'm pursuing here different Avenues. <br><br>To some extent interruptions are inherent in the job, but there should be ways to control it.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-7 18:37</div>
<div class="content">You're talkng about interruptions Alan as if they just appear from nowhere and its a mystery where they come from. But interruptions are like tasks they come from the commitments we have made - just like Mark says, theres no point tackling it at the task level, you need to reduce the commitments. So whats causing the interruptions? Like its a commitmebnt youve made to have your door open all the time or to answer the phone all the time or do what your boss says immeidately or let everyone walk all over you all the time. <br><br>But you need to remember what Mark also says, when you make a commitment its as much about what you arent going to do as about what you are. So if youre committing to do this really important work then you also should be commiting to not let it be interrupted. Especially youre not going to let it be interrupted by all the trivial littel things which youve taken on as busy work (remember what mark says about that - its all on the home page of this site).</div>

<div class="content">Meryl:<br><br>You are stating the obvious but how do you think it helps those that are faced everyday with the firehose of reality all drenched in interruptions that they helped create and don't have time to pause and wonder where it all went wrong. It's quite easy to discern an interruption after it has happen but not while it happens.<br><br>People that have created habits that perpetuate interruptions don't need lectures about the righteousness of reducing their commitments. They only way it will happen is when they get real sick and are on the hospital bed like i was. It's through behavior that you can shape beliefs, rarely the other way around once you have passed the threshold of 25 years old. In children it works the way you promote, not in adults.<br><br>Instead, why don't you give clear examples of what you DO to reduce commitments but then again, another thread might be more appropriate for this. Here, it's about how to reduce interruptions which IS the first step in reducing commitments.</div>

I always feel it's a kind of "badge of shame" to have such a long list of things that I can't whittle down any further.  But even a "badge of shame" is a badge, it's MY badge, kind of my trademark, and I have to make sure not to let that create some sense of security or identity and make me hold onto my pile of work just because it's my security blanket.<br><br>I *have* done those audits.  The first time it did really help to cut out some things that weren't necessary.  Subsequent iterations always do cut a little out.  Believe me, the issue comes up a lot.  I do a lot of these audits mentally on my long commute.  But the main elements of my workload still remain and I don't think they will go away soon.  My wife does more than I do, but somehow she does it without any kind of "system".  And we seem to be surrounded by lots of people who are doing even more.  It's just the way we live.  We LIKE doing lots of things.  And it DOESN'T necessarily mean we do it ineffectively.  <br><br><br><<< I found the note I made at the time so I'm not just making this up. >>><br><br>That never would have crossed my mind!  :-)</div>

<div class="content">BATCHING is a terrific tool for dealing with many kinds of interruptions.<br><br>Alan, you mentioned email.  This is a "low hanging fruit" -- just keep "Clear email" as a recurring SF task and do it when it stands out.   <br><br>And turn off those Outlook pop-up windows that tell you about every single new email!!<br><br>This makes you process your emails in a batch, which is much more efficient than processing them one-off.<br><br>...Which leads to a great principle:  Batch things whenever it makes sense!    Instead of going to your boss every time something comes up, save those things up and deal with them all at one go, in a daily or weekly meeting.  And train your boss to save up his/her interruptions for that meeting, too.   <br><br>And BATCHING is just an example of developing systems to handle your work.  Mark discusses this in DIT at great length, cf. the two mechanics and their different methods of working.</div>

<div class="content">Interruptions:<br><br>1) Phone calls; <br>   a) if callerid blank - let voicemail answer<br>   b) if callerd recognized - if current task stopp-able answer phone<br>   c) if callerid reconnized - if current tasks not stopp-able - voicemail - add check voicemail to c2<br>   d) if cell phone - let voicemail answer; add listen to cell voicemail to c1 - SMS a reply instead of returning the call if possible<br><br>2) Walk ups: (these apply when you are interrupted; not when you are not busy and can talk)<br>  a) If snuck up from behind - take time stopping what you are doing; and write down "restart" notes on a piece of paper. Make it clear to the person that they are interrupting you with there actions.<br>  b) If the interrupting person is there to engage in chitcat; answer all questions with 1 or 2 word answers. Attempt to turn back to work frequently until they get the hint.<br>  c) if interrupting person say "can we", "do you have time", "I need you to"; stop them and tell them you are busy and schedule time to review what they need on the calendar. You'll find out quickly how often the interruption is truly unimportant. Many many people procrastinate by playing white-rabbit around the office.<br> <br>3) Meeting requests in dysfunctional organizations:  When you a meeting request from someone other than your boss; accept it as "tentative" and in the respond request the agenda so you can prepare for the meeting.  Allows you to plan leaving the meeting early too if you aren't need for the whole thing. Make a habit if possible of not going to some percentage of meetings that don't have agendas...if they complain to your boss just point out that they never have agenda, can't stay on topic and tend to waste valuable time.  It's hard to argue with that.</div>

<div class="content">It's all relative; the more interruptive the culture of an office; the more extreme the counter measures need to be.  The real key is to know you job; and do your work, and choose your reactions to your co-workers habits based on your unique situation. <br><br>Too many people "busy" people have come to see the office as more social than employment. They will react to you in the way you set the expectations.  <br><br>I've worked some culturally great places and some terrible ones. I've always been in an internal services capacity (aka a cost center, not a profit center) with roles from doer, to manager; to director, to executive. I have never ceased to amazed at the sense of entitlement that those that interrupt carry with them especially if they believe you are there to cater to their needs. The urgency always seems to be inversely related to the appropriateness of the delivery medium.<br><br>Like Erik I find I have to cull the pile of works friends, proof you can do all of the stuff I suggested with politeness and respect. It's only in you mind's eye that you need to keep the goal blunt and harsh so that you keep the objectives starkly realistic so you actually progress at them....<br><br>As for the midwest; it's just an in-joke in the States about how fast and how long the Midwesterners can speak without pausing for a breath; you did a fair impression in you post.  :)  My mother qualifies in that regard and for a minute I thought I was reading one of her emails...</div>
