<div class="content">My son has ADHD and probably Aspergers. He definitely has the social anxiety that often goes with AS.<br><br>Getting a temporary job (he starts school again mid-August) was shrunk to deliver resumes, especially to places that won't hire him. Practice with them.<br><br>Today he finally took a resume to the car rust-proofing place I went to on Monday. He called me from a nearby parking lot where he was sitting for half an hour.<br><br>After a chat, he succeeded with the new goal. Take resume to the door and read sign saying it was closed.<br><br>I'm one who fought the so-small-it's-laughable level. Turns out it works for both of us.<br><br>Another relative has OCD. The therapy is find a goal that is only level 2 scary, out of 10. Sometimes those goals are extremely tiny.<br><br>Thanks Mark!</div>
