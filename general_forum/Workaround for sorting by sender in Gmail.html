<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Steven Freedman mentioned that Gmail doesn't support sorting in the web interface, but for some reason I was unable to reply to the blog post, so I'm making a thread instead.<br><br>While it's ridiculous that Gmail doesn't directly support sorting, there's a workaround.  You can use IMAP to access your mailbox with a regular mail client like Thunderbird which does support that functionality.  (Changes you make to your mailbox via IMAP will be reflected when you return to the web interface.)<br><br>https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960</div>
