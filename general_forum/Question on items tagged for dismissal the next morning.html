<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>AF2 is working well for me, but I do have a question that has been asked by Mike and others -- I just need some clarification here.  So, you draw a line in the morning of a task or block of tasks that are now on notice for dismissal the next morning if not done today.  You then read through the entire list starting at the beginning to regain familiarity of what is on your plate.  The you start at the end of the list and work backwards -- each time completing a task, going back to the end of the list.  But here is the conundrum I am experiencing...I know there are let's say three tasks that "are on notice" for dismissal if I do not get them done today.  But I encounter so many other tasks that stand out and since I go back to the end of the list each time -- I may not -- and all too often this occurs -- to get to those tasks that will be dismissed the next morning if not done.  It would seem that there should be a rule that one should look at those tasks first and really see if something stands out before starting at the end of the list.  <br><br>Please help with this, Mark.  And all others -- I treasure all opinions on this forum!<br><br>Best wishes to All,<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Imagine you are walking down the street.  You look frequently at things that are close to you because they may trip you or bite you.  You look infrequently at those things that are far away because they mostly aren't as urgent as the close things.  As long as you are looking around at all, the balance of where you look and what you choose to take action on is a natural one--it doesn't require conscious thought on your part to accomplish.  If there's a crack in the sidewalk, you step over it.  If the sidewalk is closed for repairs, you may change course from half a block away.<br><br>AF2 provides a structure for "looking around" in our lives.  The entire list is reviewed at least once a day, and a subset of the list is reviewed before choosing each action to do.  These reviews keep list items fresh enough in your mind to allow your intuition to make sensible priority decisions from moment to moment without strain.<br><br>Items about to be dismissed are usually not urgent, mission-critical items that absolutely must be done immediately.  That's why they're at the end of your list, out of the way of better things to do.  You read these on-notice items at least once a day, during your morning read-through of the entire list.  More frequent review would be wasteful.<br><br>I know you are worried about dismissing something important.  If you follow the rules, though, I think you will find that most things work out OK.<br><br>Remember:  dismissing an item doesn't mean that you aren't allowed to do it anymore.  You can always massage it back to life in a few days and give yourself another three weeks of procrastinating on it before you have to dismiss it again.  :-)<br><br>I hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br>Why are you worried about dismissing the items?  If other items stand out for you even when you know you have 3 at-risk-of dismissal tasks, then would not that just mean that those other tasks need to be done anyway?<br><br>I was worried about dismissing items initially until I realized that I was turning AF2 into a game where avoiding item dismissal was the goal.  My day should not revolve around finding ways to avoid dismissing items.  It should be to get the items that need to be done done.<br><br>Sometimes I felt as though I'm trying to beat AF2's "autofocusing" feature by working on items to avoid their dismissal when my intuition and objective evaluation tell me that I have to work on other items.<br><br>Once I stopped obsessing over rescuing at-risk items, AF2 flowed a lot smoother and revealed to me more about my priorities.  As others have said, you can re-evaluate dismissed items and later add back to your list when the time is right (or not, in which case, it may get dismissed again).</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>You've gotten the same answers I did ... and I still don't buy them.  It is most likely a question of how different minds work.  The way I see things, I look at what is in front of me and see what stands out.  That there is something "important" many pages away does not affect me because it is not "urgent".  I suppose people are saying that the threat of dismissal is going to make those items "urgent".  It does not seem to happen that way for me.  I only see what is in front of my nose so I can't deselect what is on the last 20 pages and know that what is on page 1 is now urgent and so stands out.<br><br>Different minds, I guess.  I'm trying to think of a good work around.  For now, I moved the marked one to the end of the list so they would be there.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Mike. <br><br>Right now I start daily with the on-notice items instead of the last item. This gives my mind a chance to address these items before the daily gyrations take hold. At least it solves the out-of-sight, out-of-mind syndrome (for me).<br><br>In the time I have been using AF2, the issue I am struggling with is the dismissal rule that expects that items to be actioned within 2 days. It works out in many cases but there are cases when I have to think about some of them. A simple example is some of my weekend "home" items that were not addressed on Sunday got dismissed by Tuesday as they didn't get a chance to action till the following weekend. May be its because of mismatch between dismissal time periods (daily) and the ability to action them (may not be daily). <br><br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">Hi all - my experience with on notice tasks (after about a week of using AF2), is that they pull me back towards them, especially if they are something I consider important.<br><br>Covey's 4 quadrants are a useful way of describing it - what's urgent usually gets immediate attention, but what's important tends to end up at the bottom of the pile, because its not screaming at you.<br><br>So, for me, the on notice items get the deserved attention they need or are dismissed completely. Also, if partially worked on, they are thrown back to the back of the list, where they sort of change quandrants as it were, and assume a higher level of urgency. I found that to be useful to kick start something I've neglected, and now gets into higher gear at the end of the list.<br><br></div>

Sunday mornings).<br><br>That said, it runs against the spirit of AF in that it is supposed to require no filtering and to take what you throw at it.  I'm sure that Mark would probably say to just let the items be dismissed then go rescue them again next week.  It seems as if we are really working from different premises and ways of doing things.  I filter things and put off adding them to the list until next week, while others put them on the list, dismiss them, then rescue them next week.  Just different ways of looking at life, I guess ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>you asked whether there should be a rule that one should look at those tasks that "are on notice" for dismissal first and really see if something stands out before starting at the end of the list. <br><br>The more I think of it, the more I am inclined to say that I look at the item and decide depending on the urgency of each task that "is on notice" for dismissal (and not decide depending on the "standing out" nature of the item). It can't be "immediate", because if it was immediate it wouldn't be written on my list and I'd already working on it.  If it's "same day" urgent or due within the next few days, I'd schedule it on my calendar to be done today or at least started today. And if it's "everything else" I'd ignore it and look at the next task that "is on notice" for dismissal. Depending on the result of this process I'll either follow the rules of AF 2 or ignore the rules until it's possible to return to normal procedure.<br><br>So, my personal answer is: Look at each of those items and decide depending on urgency, not on "standing out".</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, everyone, for your advice!  I am now going to look at the items tagged for dismissal first thing in the morning, and as Rainer suggested, if they are truly urgent, important, then I will focus on them FIRST BEFORE I begin at the end of the list.  If they are not, then I will proceed as to the regular AF2 instructions.<br><br>Comments?  Suggestions?  Mark....are you there?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-5 19:38</div>
<div class="content">It seems to me that by working on "on notice" items first you are eliminating an essential element of AF2 - dismissal.  If you're working with a mature list, you will most likely have seen the "on notice" item(s) multiple times before they got that dreaded line drawn underneath them.  To treat the line as "do these now" rather than "if you don't get to these you have to dismiss them" defeats the intuitive portion of the system.<br><br>As for putting a reminder on a calendar for items that you can't do now, I think this is perfectly valid.  It is certainly an important part of my use of AF.  For example - last week it flitted through my mind that I (will) need to work on my daughter's birthday dress.  But her birthday isn't until the end of September, and I have more than enough things that I'm working on right now.  So I put it on the list, and when it stood out to me I put a reminder in my "AF Reminders" calendar for the first of September, which will give me enough time to get it done by the end of the month.  Similarly, I have an ongoing project that has had to move to the back burner for a couple of weeks because there are other things that are more time-critical right now.  Last time that project stood out to me, I put a reminder in my calendar to cycle it back into my list later in the month, when I will be able to work on it again.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sarah,<br><br>Your points are very well taken.  I do agree that these items have been on my mature list and now they are facing dismissal.  But with my work, I have so many things on my plate that I have to shuffle things around and put some things on the back-burner for a while even though they are important -- because just as important and/or urgent things have to be done.  SO when these items are now tagged for dismissal, it does not mean for me that they are less important because they have been on my list for a while or that I have procrastinated about them -- I simply have chosen due to many issues that they had to be on the shelf for a bit.  I am sure other very busy people (I routinely have 65+ hour work weeks) do the same things as I do.  <br><br>So what is the answer?  I am not sure....I cannot trim my workload down -- so I need a system that works with me and has the flexibility for me to make these kind of decisions.  AF2 may be it -- it is working except for the rapid dismissal rules.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Why not put them on a weekly or so reminder/tickler? And possibly look at them as part of a daily review?<br><br>If there's too much 'backburner' type stuff on the list, surely wading through it multiple times per day will slow things down.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">... or another option could be to decide your own 'on notice for dismissal' interval, which is more suitable to your situation, or the likely time you'll have to work on the list that day.

<div class="content">Hi Jane,<br><br>Thanks -- I have read through all of the discourse there.  I am of the opinion that all of us will simply have to modify the AF2 dismissal rules to meet our particular schedules in terms of tasks.  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I am wondering if those who are concerned about the dismissal rules with AF2 are using their old AF1 list or not? I started a new one and I am not having to keep more than two tasks up for dismissal at a time so far. I also don't feel the need to work on these items first, but instead just feel free to very quickly skim the list on my way to those items whenever I choose. My list is a short digital one. I wonder if that makes a difference? I am much happier with dismissal in AF2 than in AF1 and even in AF1, it wasn't a big deal as I ended up doing so many of the dismissed tasks eventually anyway.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>I am indeed using my old AF1 list.  I know Mark said it was best to start anew, but what was I supposed to do with all of my tasks already on my list?  This was discussed before and Mark did indicate to many queries that one COULD start with their existing AF1 list and if they did not like AF2, they would still have the same list.<br><br>But I think you are correct -- if I started with a new list, it would be smaller and all items would be "new".  But again -- what about the pages of tasks I already have on my plate?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, Mike,<br><br>Nothing in the standard rules prevents you from listing a recently dismissed task and working on it straight away. (This is one of the big, subtle differences between AF1 and AF2.) For me, I'd also think about reworking the task if something other than pressure of work were holding me back. And if I didn't actually get on with the task immediately, I would see that as a danger sign.<br><br>Alternatively, I might do a longer review of dismissed items less frequently.<br><br>I really don't see the problem.<br><br>Mark,<br><br>Please do straighten me out if I've misunderstood again.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Will</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-6 15:02</div>
<div class="content">Two thoughts:<br><br>1. David, I don't see anything in the orthodox AF2 rules that implies you can't put tasks on the back burner for a while, or that implies that dismissal means something isn't important. As long as "review dismissed tasks" is an item on your list, there is literally no danger of important-but-back-burnered being neglected. <br><br>2. I'm not trying to be argumentative, but in an important (slightly philosophical) sense, anyone who says they CAN'T trim down their workload is, technically, not speaking the truth. You always COULD choose to trim your workload, if you were willing to pay the price. The price might be letting someone down, or risking a poor job evaluation, or, if you wanted to trim your workload down to zero, poverty. I'm not suggesting you ought to pay any of these prices, obviously that's none of my business. But AF is (almost uniquely among productivity systems) VERY GOOD at denying the user the opportunity to fool themselves that they can do more than they can really do. And the dismissal phase, it seems to me, is the part where that becomes most clear. So if you're committed to more than you can really manage, AF will keep reminding you of this, day in day out -- whereas many suggested tweaks to the system have the effect of smothering those reminders. <br><br>When you're in that situation you have three choices, logically speaking: a) reduce your workload; b) suffer the discomfort of an AF system that feels ill-suited to your needs because it's reminding you every day that you're overstretching yourself; c) develop some tweaks to reduce the discomfort without reducing your commitments. Option c) may be a perfectly justifiable choice for busy and stressful times, but I do think it's worth admitting that it is, in a way, a self-deluding one.</div>

<div class="content">David, I am not sure if I understand the problem correctly. Lets say you see three important items in the morning that you'd had to dismiss next day. You draw the line, then read the list top to bottom, then begin at the end.<br><br>Now, when you know that the things on top are due to be dismissed, theoretically, nothing else should stand out as you make your way to the top (because you know they are due etc). <br><br>From my experience during the last week with AF2, reaching the top items is only a problem if the dismissal does not seem imminent. Once I really commit to dismissing, the top items "stand out". <br><br>Besides, as I understood dismissal, it is still possible to reenter these items, after a time, maybe slightly rephrased. <br><br>Or just do one minute of it and reenter at the end...<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I am also having trouble with dismissal, but didn't use the original Autofocus system so only have experience of AF2. However, I was checking earlier posts for guidance on dismissal, and I note that Mark said that before re-entering a dismissed task you should consider, amongst other things, "why it was rejected". I think the problem with AF2 is that the dismissed tasks haven't actually been rejected since you are reviewing your list backwards from the newest tasks. As I understand it, the original Autofocus system required you to read through your tasks from the oldest to the newest, which meant that you had always seen and rejected the tasks that were likely to be dismissed in the near future. In AF2, the only time you see those early tasks is first thing in the morning when you review the whole list.<br><br>The difficulty I'm having is that on days when a lot of tasks come in, a very important task can quicky end up being followed by a lot of other tasks. And so that important task can easily slip my mind because I'm focusing on the most recent page of the list.<br><br>I certainly do find it helpful to sometimes follow Mark's advice of breaking the task down further before re-writing it. Other times, however, I create a MIT list at the start of the day when I am reviewing the list from beginning to end. This helps to highlight important tasks near the beginning of the list, but I guess it disrupts the autofocus element a little. Do you think, rather than creating a MIT list, that it would be better to simply transfer important early tasks to the end of the list when doing the whole list review?</div>

<div class="content">In using my old AF list to transfer to AF2, I've found that I have very few items at the front of the list that are "on notice."  I mark those with a post-it flag (usually one of those sign here arrows) & since they are usually repetitive items (shred old files for example), as well as close to a month old, I choose to do those items first before working my list from back to front.  As I've stated before, I also put flags on other items that stand out as I go through my daily review.  This not only keeps me focused without having to search for things, but it also makes sure that I do what is urgent and get those items out of the way.  <br><br>In AF1, I found that working front to back caused me to not want to put items on the list at all (b/c I wouldn't make it to the end of the list), but with AF2, I'm willing to add a lot more items and getting a lot more accomplished!  My desk hasn't looked this neat in months!  :)  On Friday I added ~100 new items and crossed off about 1/2 of those as well as quite a few older items.<br><br>For me, daily review is key to the whole success of AF2 to keep those urgent and about to be dismissed items in front of me without them being forgotten.  Everyone has their tweaks & way they work the system.  Some use different colors, some use flags, some use calenders & ticklers.  Finding the way that best works for you to get everything done is key.</div>

<div class="content">The biggest plus for me with AF2 and constantly having "permission" to work the most recently added tasks. With AF1, I was asking for an insane amount of self-discipline in waiting until I got to the last page to work them. With the size of my list at that time, it just wasn't working. This works beautifully and  I still have plenty of incentive to work the tasks up for dismissal.</div>
