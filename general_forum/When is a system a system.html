<div class="content">When is a system a complete system, meaning being self-contained?  I see many posts where people say that they love AF, but go on to say things, like I use AF along with my project list, someday maybe list, daily tasks on a post-it etc.  Is this really doing AF?  In my mind a system whatever it may be should be able to stand on its own as designed and handle all you need to get accomplished, projects, tasks, actions, items you are awaiting a response on etc, without the need for tweaking.<br><br>This is not a slam on AF, because, I believe if you do it as written, it can be all you need with the obvious exception of a calendar.  I just wanted to see why people are tweaking AF and not using it as designed and to see what people think about the idea of a pure system.  I have always been a believer in simple, under the theory that less is better and the more places something can be, the more places it isn’t meaning you have to review too many things to figure out what you need to do the less effective you are.<br><br>Gerry <br></div>

<div class="content">I totally agree with you Gerry!!!  Keep it simple sweetheart!<br><br>My only exception to this is my email, as I really don't like "copying" the tasks/projects into AF and like to work straight from my email as an adjunct to AF.<br><br>I do use a calendar at work for meetings - only.  If something has a deadline in AF, I write the date in brackets on the right hand side.  I use the calendar in my blackberry for personal appointments - but I only have to get notification of one or two things a month that specifically.  I avoid most pre-planned activities outside of work though as my work schedule has been too busy to commit to things like that.<br><br>I've come to the conclusion that some people just like tinkering with a set of systems because they think they're doing something.  Or it helps them plan things?  I'm just grateful that I can skip out on a whole bunch of work.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I completely agree with you Gerry - the simpler the better.  I find I can use AF for everything and process everything from within AF, including recording items that need to be scheduled, and project management.  There is of course a need for a separate schedule (as time dependent items would be lost within AF lists) and for a separate project management system (as projects contain physical "stuff" that would not be able to be handwritten into a list) but "The List" manages all!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry,<br><br>I'm going to approach this from a philosophical perspective.  When is a system a system?  I would first answer the question: What is the scope of the system you are considering?<br><br>No time management system will actually cook dinner for you, will it?  Does that make it an incomplete system?  Not at all as cooking meals, while something you want to do, is not within the scope of a time management system.<br><br>AF leaves out many things that, IMO, must be done: plan goals, control time related items, handle scheduled and repeating items.  Does that make it "incomplete"?  I guess it all depends on where you draw the line.  I feel that AF does what it says it will do.  It is a TOOL which, when used as described, will help manage discretionary time.  It is not deficient because it has no rules about planning one's goals.  It is silent on that mater because that is not within the scope of the AF system.  It is pretty well assumed that you have goals and have planned them.<br><br>My view on this is that all of these "systems" are not really "systems" but tools.  Much as a hammer is only one tool, not the entire kit a carpenter needs to do his work.  If one comes up with a design for a better hammer he should not be criticized because it won't saw wood!<br><br>My advice would be to use AF in the way designed and fit it into the context of the way you run your life.  Use a calendar.  Have shopping lists.  Have project lists.  File reference material.  Keep records of how you have done tasks in the past so you don't have to reinvent them.  Use all of the time management tools which make sense to you.  But if you are using AF, don't tinker with the AF rules so far as working the pages or dismissing items.  That will kill the AF system.  Other than that, AF lives happily with all of your other tools.</div>

<div class="content">100% agree with Mark, Christine and Jacqueline. I tried to tweak AF and it was a wash out some i went back to the basic WITHOUT any thing ELSE except for my calendar were i put Appointment, deadlines, events of the day and very important task or project i must begin or do this day.  <br><br>For the rest i use  less and less omnifocus prefering a project made on Macintosh "page"  (I created a folder for actives projects and un active projects and drop them here) an alternative soft to word. My adress are on adress (mac) and i manage all my company with that. <br><br>Also I found something great with AF it's the feeling of quietness knowing that i didnt forget anything for it's on AF even if task may be everywhere. <br><br>To be perfectly honest, i had too must task on AF at a moment. as things became complicated I just took another Notebook and reported all active task on my new note book for doing my discretionary tasks and I repported too on my diary things i planed to do or deadlines or events. Then it was much better and efficient and the system got rid of was not necessary to do...<br><br>As a said before on another post AF hate twinking and it doesnt accept any other system except itself. <br><br>SO KEEP IT SIMPLE and use one system you think suits you and DO IT respecting the rules. <br><br>For the moment AF is OK for me, anyway much better than GTD wich was to hard for my mind.</div>

<div class="content">Mike: "AF leaves out many things that, IMO, must be done: plan goals"<br><br>Funnily enough, this is an area I like using AF for. I like the way one can put in alternative scenarios and just leave the brainstormed elements in situ, to be dismissed if they are not adopted. Have you tried planning thus?<br><br>Pre AF I would always plan in an outliner.</div>

<div class="content">I have to agree with Laurence that AF does help me identify and plan my goals - but in the manner Mark describes - ie from a bottom up perspective. I love the fact that I can add ideas - which may then be extracted for planning - or may fall by the wayside - no pressure either way .....</div>

<div class="content">My experience, both with myself and with the hundreds of people I've coached over the years on time management, is that you can have all the project planning methods you like but they don't actually help much in getting the project done. (I'm talking here about getting your stuff done as an individual - not coordinating the activities of a number of people which obviously does require planning.)<br><br>My impression with some of the people who tinker with AF is that they are using it to try to get their pet project management method to work. My message to them is: If project management hasn't worked for you up to now, then it's not going to work with AF either. Why not just forget about it?<br><br>Of course there may be people for whom project management does work, but in that case why would they need to use AF?</div>
<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-04-8 14:56</div>
<div class="content">Laurence,<br><br>No, I have not tried it that way because, to me, bottom up planning is a contradiction in terms.  Planning is a top down thing, starting from the result and working back to the actions and tasks.  I can't imagine how I could call it "planning" if I just put "build new house" and left it to my subconscious to figure out how to do it.  I'd be clearing land before I learned if it was not zoned for a house, for example, because I would not know I had to do that.  Diving right in on a complex project just does not cut it.  I can dive in if I have "enough" info ... basically experience ... but for something where my experience is lacking I need to plan, learn, figure out the holes, plan some more, then take the first steps ... and, of course, tear up the plan and do it over with my newly learned information.<br><br>The only sense in which AF (or any To DO list) works for me as a "planning" tool is when I make a mistake.  IOW, I decide to buy a new coffee maker and then when I do so I find that it uses special filters or something so I have to halt, and go looking for the sources and costs of those special filters before I proceed.  So that is a case where I thought I had enough info to not plan but it turned out I was wrong.  And no harm done, you can't make a project out of everything, after all. <br><br>My planning rule of thumb is that I try to visualize the project from beginning to end.  If I can't do that ... if I am puzzled about something or can't connect the dots in some way ... then my ignorance is sufficient to require me to plan.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I think "Build New House" is a excellent example of where bottom-up planning would work very well. If I decided I wanted to build a new house (unlikely!) I wouldn't have the faintest idea of how to produce a plan. Instead what I'd do is put "Build New House" into my AF list (or perhaps "Build New House?" with a query).<br><br>When I came to that task I would probably action it by adding some new tasks, like "Read web articles on building new houses", "Talk to X about building new house", "Call District Planning Department", "Get recommendations for builders", "Work out how much I can afford" and so on. As I dealt with each of these so I would add more tasks.  And so on until either the house is complete or I've decided not to build one after all!</div>

<div class="content">I like Mark's comment on the project plan.  I do think one of the reasons AF works is the more you are actually getting done, the less time and need for planning.  I think I am realizing that I actually need less planning than I thought and more doing.  It reminds me of the old MBWA, management by wandering around.  With AF it is sort of like planning by writing, seeing what sticks out, doing  and dismissing.  <br><br>One also needs to be willing to be wrong on occasion and not wait for the perfect plan to begin the actual implementation.  Obviously certain projects like a rocket launch or an operation can't be done like this, but other projects certainly can be where the price of a failure of a component along the way is less costly than the benefit of jump starting the project. <br><br>Also, I see that AF is like the center of a wheel, with other aspects being the spokes.  AF can be used to amplify the effectiveness of project plans and other components.<br><br>Thanks to all who responded.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">DIT came with a clear warning that it was for managing your tasks within a project but not for managing the project itself. I had the impression that originally, AF carried the same warning.<br><br>From the notes above, we seem to be moving beyond that to a bold claim that AF will manage most types of project without any external planning, and that all you need are:<br>- AF<br>- a diary/ calendar<br>- a document filing system<br><br>Is this the consensus?</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I used to work for a fairly large agricultural company that was run by a very strange family.  Believe it or not, I was in charge of writing the business plans that they needed to put together to get financing, grants, etc.  My job was superfluous though because they never followed the plans.  I could never get any of the information that I needed from them, and I finally concluded it was because they didn't really know.  They were literally playing it by ear - with millions of dollars at stake.   They were also highly innovative though and could think of back-up plans and alternatives like nothing I've ever seen.<br><br>They actually did dive in and build a huge feedlot without obtaining the appropriate permits, received warning letters, etc..  The funny thing is that they always got away with things like this, and got businesses and projects up and running in an extremely short period of time.  Fortune favors the bold, I guess.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>One can hope to get away with it, and some do.  Others do not and wind up tearing out foundations that were not inspected.  For every lucky dog who jumps in hoping for the best, there are ten unlucky ones who end up on the rocks.<br><br>As to not following plans, I hear 'ya.  Some of the biggest corporations don't follow plans very well ... thus the state of our economy right now.  One woman, I forget her name now, wrote a biography of IBM.  After a lot of horror stories about how mismanaged they really are she observed that only a company as well funded as IBM could screw up so badly and still survive.  Imagine how well they'd do if they had a modicum of business sense.  They would never have lost the PC market to Microsoft, for one small example!<br><br>As to the auto manufactures, banks, etc.  Well, just consult the newspapers.<br><br>The problem with Mark's idea of bottom up planning is that it is possible to head down a wrong path and not know it.  In his example, what he basically described is putting a task into AF to tell him to do the planning.  "Read articles on building a house" is the first step in most plans. What is learned by that task constitutes the subsequent steps.  AND, as I have observed, most books on doing things yourself come with instructions to lay out a plan ... so even the bottom up approach will hit the step: "Make a plan".<br><br>But hey, if you want to call "winging it" "planning", all I can say is: "Whatever works for you."  I've been in planning for a good long while and some of my clients (well, IBM's clients, actually) had some very large scoped projects.  I've seen planning work and planning fail.  I've never seen an unplanned project succeed.  But maybe my universe is too small.  ;-)<br><br><envisioning the project: "Build a bomb based on nuclear fission." succeeding without a plan.

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>That is the conundrum of time management.  If you  have a project plan and are putting tasks into another system, the true "system" is now not AF, but project plans in conjunction with AF.  I have always gone for simplicity.  When I wrote my Simple Guide to Time Management and the post on project focus, I was trying to come up with simple ways to manage all of ones commitments like projects, tasks etc into one place.  In the past, I may have mistaken project plans for tasks that just needed to get done.  It may be helpful to see everything that needs to be done for a "project" in my case a real estate project in one place, but in hind site, it was not all truly stuff that had a sequence or was more than tasks that needed to be done.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I wouldn't say that I'd actually do that myself.  Just that they did - but like I said, they were weird.  :-)  I think there's a place for both, it's just knowing when to not over-plan and let things develop or when a little up-front planning will save you a lot of time and money in the long run.<br><br>Tesla on Edison:<br><br>"His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90% of the labour.

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I don't recall saying anywhere that I had anything against planning, nor did I say that "winging it" was an acceptable substitute. What I was saying is that projects should arise naturally from what you are doing, and so should plans. The example you gave of IBM, auto manufacturers and banks are examples of bad planning, not of lack of planning. In fact organisations like these are generally full of planning and plans and mission statements and visions and goals and targets - all in fact examples of top-down planning. It's all too easy to let the plans take over and be entirely oblivious to what's really going on.<br></div>

What I wanted to make clear is that time management is an entirely different subject from project management. <br><br>Time management is what you use to manage your own actions within a number of projects.

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br><<Build a bomb based on nuclear fission>><br><br>An interesting example, because of course the scientists who originally were working on nuclear fission had no intention of their work being used to produce a bomb. No one in say 1930 was working to a top-down goal of "build a nuclear bomb that can end the next war by dropping it on two enemy towns." It wasn't until about 1933 that scientists started to realise what the implications of the work for warfare might be - and pretty horrified by them they were.<br><br>The Manhattan project could produce the bomb but the actual ability to use it was completely out of their control because it depended on two other major factors:<br><br>1) An aircraft capable of carrying it.<br><br>2) Having airfields sufficiently close for the aircraft to carry it to the enemy target towns.<br><br>In fact neither of these conditions were available until shortly before the time when the bombs were dropped (August 1945). The heavy-lift B-29s weren't introduced until early 1945, and the Marianas weren't captured until November 1944. Both of these were done with the intention of facilitating conventional bombing, not the nuclear bomb.<br><br>So the use of the atomic bomb was actually literally a case of "winging it" - seizing opportunities as they arose.</div>

<div class="content">Mark's description of Time Management vs Project Management is exactly it.<br><br>My Project Management System is indeed the system to manage everything related to individual projects whereas AF manages that Project Management System and enables me to define and move the projects forward.<br><br>I think for me that the Project process becomes more of a wave motion - by adding tasks, thoughts, ideas etc into AF projects begin to emerge (the bottom up approach).  What I personally have done is to extract those items into my Project system, work on the planning, scope, definition, action steps etc, (the top down or planning approach) and then readd them into AF as appropriate.  They again often generate new steps and so on.  Sometimes they will be dismissed so the Project is put on the back burner.  If I want to reinstate it at some point in the future I already have "a plan" which is a starting point for next time.<br><br>Some years ago I did an exercise with my staff when we decided to identify projects and define job processes.  I got everyone to write a list of everything they did or had on a to do list, and to include on that list everything they could think of.  I then got them to highlight everything they did as a routine and extract those to a separate list.  Those tasks became the basis of a job specification.  All other tasks were examined and grouped by type, forming the basis of natural projects.  That method of project identification has always seemed incredibly natural to me and whilst we will all have a feel for what projects we are working on, that type of exercise can produce some surprising results.<br><br>I so wish I had had AF then - my staff were encouraged to schedule specific routine and project time but how much better a pure AF approach would have been!</div>

Having those things covered in a system brings my mind peace and frees it up for higher thinking/creating pursuits.  We're all different.  Even before my brain injuries, I scheduled my obligations and pursuits and used checklists to automate the mundane stuff.  Boredom is torture to me so I prefer a system that will aide me in accelerating these types of tasks to go as quickly/efficiently as possible.  Then my brain is clear and I don't have to waste time deciding on this same stuff over and over.  No system is superior to another except to the person who is using it!

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>I know exactly what you mean - just that I have always struggled with being told "when" to do something.  I know some of my staff were quite happy to just work through a scheduled list but others would definitely have benefited from AF.  The sentence that sticks out in your post is "Boredom is torture to me so I prefer a system that will aide me in accelerating these types of tasks to go as quickly/efficiently as possible."  My problem is that routines nearly always become boring for me - not enough challenge I guess - so the fact that AF lets me do them when I want to has a massive effect.  You know where you have said in other posts about using routines to free your mind to work on other things?  That is exactly what happens to me with that type of task under AF.  Under a scheduled system my mind would be constantly in grumpy mode and focusing on the fact that it did not want to be doing the task.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry,<br><br>I agree with your conclusion, from a philosophical perspective.  My problem is that when looking at how people run their lives I don't see that it fits.  IOW, if I am on a Project (capitalized) I am probably using a Project Management system.  I have no flexibility in that as there are others involved and reporting to be done which must go back into that system.  In such a case I do not have discretionary time, with respect to that Project so I do not use AF to manage my Project tasks.<br><br>OTOH, I would not put my grocery shopping into that Project Management system for reasons to numerous to mention ;-)  This leaves me using multiple "systems" but then I am doing multiple "things".

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>I agree.  I have thought a lot about this subject and written a short ebook on the subject and my post on Project Focus mostly as a way to try to "invent" a system that works for my specific situation.  The reality is that I am not really using project plans, but have just found that for other reasons, such as being able to report to management and have discussions with subordinates and vendors, I can not really do AF.  I have to have a list of all the open issues in one place by property.  It is just easier to then work off those lists.  This cuts down re-writing.   I do use the AF method of processing the items on the list by seeing what stands out.  <br><br>I continue to use AF for everything in my personal life and it works great.<br><br>Gerry</div>

I'd have a folder for each property with actions, outcomes, dates, contacts, records of conversations, whatever I'd need to be able to reference by property.  I simply see no other way to back one's self up to management, and for legal reasons, I suppose.<br><br>However, I would probably also have the actions on an AF list to get them done as the day progresses.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>You said: "I've already said in this thread that I'm not against planning, that I was referring to one's own individual goals and projects and not to project planning itself. And I'm certainly not suggesting that one can do without supporting documentation."<br><br>I'm not sure what you are responding to.  I had no thought that you'd be against documentation.  I was simply suggesting that AF might be able to handle tasks that were already listed in project files.  Perhaps I was unclear.<br><br>You said: "Doesn't every plan start with someone putting a goal into whatever system they are using? The Manhattan Project would have started with someone saying "We need to develop some sort of nuclear fission weapon before Adolf does"."<br><br>Yes.  Plans start with goals.<br><br>You said: "It would have been quite a while after that that detailed plans were drawn up, and by the time they came to fruition Adolf was a dead letter."<br><br>Yes, again.  It was fortuitous.  But does that imply that there should have been no Manhattan project?  The project took as long is it did because it was a hard problem to solve.  It did not take that long because the planning was poor, or that there was no plan at all.  And, in the end, the project succeeded and I'm fairly convinced that it would not have succeeded with no plan.<br><br>I have do doubt that you understand what project planning is.  I'm not sure why you think I would think you did not.  I'm disagreeing with you that planning is not useful in one's own personal life, which is what you seem to be saying repeatedly (unless I have misunderstood you).  My contention is that one should sit down periodically and decide what one's goals are.  As to how much of a plan one uses to achieve them, I think that periodic review and feedback are useful.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I'm only responding to what you have been saying on this thread which has included such remarks as :<br><br><<But hey, if you want to call "winging it" "planning">><br><br><< envisioning the project: "Build a bomb based on nuclear fission." succeeding without a plan. Kaboom! >><br><br><<I realize you did not say you were against planning but I'm at a loss to interpret a "bottom up planning methodology" as anything else.>><br><br><<Perhaps I misunderstood your method, but what I got was that you put the "goal" into the system and see where it leads. How would I distinguish that kind of planning from no planning at all?>><br><br>I may be being unduly sensitive but I would have though that there was at least an implication there that I don't know what project planning is.<br><br>I didn't say that the Manhattan project didn't require planning. What I was saying was that the production and use of a fission bomb was a long process which developed through many stages over a matter of decades, and which could not have been controlled by an initial overall plan because no one realised the full implications of what was happening. They only became apparent as the work progressed. It was in fact a fine example of goals arising out of the work being done - which is exactly what I advocate.<br><br>Also what you were saying about planning a house went a long way beyond just periodically reviewing the goal and getting feedback on it - none of which I would have the slightest quarrel with.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I'm about ready to throw in the towel on this one.  It all seems so simple and obvious to me but somehow we seem to wind up talking at cross purposes.  Clearly I do not think planning is a static thing so I certainly do on think that the plan for the Manhattan Project was fully formed and immutable from the beginning.  Planning is dynamic and, as someone else here said, it is the process of planning that is important, not the plan itself.<br><br>As to any implication on my part that you do not know how to plan, I regret any carelessness on my part in how I might have expressed my ideas.  What I believe is not that you don't understand what planning is, but that you believe that it is not useful and possibly even counter productive.  On this point, we shall just have to agree to disagree.<br><br>I expect that at this point, anyone who wants to know about goals and planning has heard both sides of the story so any further vigorous defense of goal setting and personal planning would probably be more distracting than helpful to the subject of how to use AF to manage tasks.</div>

<div class="content">So, Mark, if I want to move house, would you recommend that I use AF to build a separate  list of the tasks, steps and deadlines to keep everything on track or keep everything in Autofocus? <br><br>(I think we are all agreed that a team project needs a plan to keep the team moving coherently)</div>

<div class="content">Will:<br><br>It's been a long time since I last moved house - I've been in my present one since 1986 - but let me cast my mind back to when I had to transport my family (five of us) from Germany to England into temporary accommodation and then after two further moves in a couple of years into our present house. Five houses in two years and three schools for the children.<br><br>Do you know, I think I managed it all without any list of task, steps and deadlines or any time management system like AF. I just did what needed doing at the time. It would certainly have been easier if I'd had AF then, but I can't imagine that a list of the type you mention would have been any use at all.<br><br>What I'd probably do these days if I had to go through a similar experience is put the individual actions into AF as they came up, but also have a generic "House Move" task, which would be a chance to do a batch of actions together. That way I could do the actions separately or together as I felt like at the time.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark.<br><br>It hadn't occurred to me to add more generic tasks when I have detailed tasks on the list. A subtle and powerful idea which I  will use forthwith.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Will<br><br>It's a very good method - I find I often then go off list to plan, sometimes by MindMap but usually in OneNote where I co-ordinate my projects, and that generates the next set of actions for my AF list.</div>

<div class="content">Christine B,<br><br>I do the off list planning and breaking down to tasks. What I hadn't done was SUBSEQUENTLY add a generic task for a project as a whole to allow me to hoover up the related tasks scattered through my pages and do them together.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Will<br><br>The hoovering up is a great part of the process!  My "major backlog" that I just cleared had bits splattered throughout my book and that was where my OneNote version took minutes to tag all of those and print out a list as a working document.  On my next cycle through the pages all I had to do was check that list to see if the task had been completed.  I cleared loads that way ...... :-)</div>
