<div class="content">I'm using ListPro, and my Office AutoFocus file now has 12 inactive lists and 8 active ones. Clearly as time goes on the number of inactive lists will grow and grow. Which makes ListPro get incrementally slower. Especially on the PDA! So it makes sense to move them into a separate archive file. On the other hand, it is nice to see some inactive ones in front of me as proof the system is working.<br><br>I am wondering how electronic users are responding to this inevitable situation. My inclination is just to move the whole lot to a separate file, and move dismissed pages to it as they become inactive.</div>

<div class="content">I have a separate folder in Outlook for rejected items.<br><br>But this has little impact on performance: I have far more completed than dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">I have a dismissed item list/folder. But one thing I'm doing helps me see my progress. I keep my original pages archived (at least for now) so if I need to check whether I've done something, I can easily search and find the completed item. So I started with page 1. Then when that page was finished and I reached my self-created limit of 25 pages, I created Page 1*. That tells me it's the second generation of page 1. I will probably create Page 1** soon. At some point, I will archive all the successive generations and will go back to regular Page 1. I use this method so I don't have Page 50-Page 70 and so on.</div>

<div class="content">I am currently using a hybrid system.  When all my lists were electronic, I was using Things.  I would drop a completed page into the schedule to review in 1 month.  My plan is to discard, or rephrase tasks when I review them and then never review that page again.  So I can delete it at that stage.<br><br></div>
