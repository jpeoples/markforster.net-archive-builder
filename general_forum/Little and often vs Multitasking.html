<div class="content">Multitasking is bad (at least according to a huge number of blog posts on the net). Little and often is good.<br><br>But isn't Little and Often a kind of Multitasking?</div>

<div class="content">I think when most refer to multitasking they really mean "rapid, different context-focus switching". Like so:<br><br>Project A (And also, a quick email check)<br>Project A (Check news while waiting for file to load)<br>Project A (Talk to to Bob who just walked in, but keep glancing back at Project A, oh...and also glance at the news again)<br>Project A (Check email again, leave instant messaging program running in background and PPP over to it if something interesting shows up)<br>Project A (Load up a podcast to listen to while I "focus" on Project A, get a quick news update every few minutes and also monitor my messages)<br><br>When Mark refers to little and often, I believe he means to focus exclusively on one thing you're doing, do it, and when you've done enough, move on to another thing and focus on it exclusively.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, Michael B's just about got it right. The key word I think is "distraction". In multi-tasking you are constantly allowing yourself to be distracted by and from one task after another. In little and often you are choosing to focus on one thing specifically and not allowing yourself to be distracted until you are done for the time being.</div>
