<div class="content">Hi Mark and all,<br>As I need to do urgencies and unfinished tasks first and as we read from left to right, <br>I wondered if you have tried to invert columns of SF. I mean put C1 on the left and C2 on the right .  What could be the result of SF process ? Did you try it ?</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>You do mean C1 on the right and C2 on the left, right?<br><br>Well, kinda interesting concept, and I dunno if it's going to be any difference, but no haven't tried that yet ^____^</div>

<div class="content">@nuntym YES C1 on the right and C2 on the left <br><br>I thought about this because it tools a long time to reach C2 columns and I was exhausted. <br>At night looking to what was worth to do I realized I made many of non strategic task but not a real work on what was urgent and was was unfinished i.e. what I worked on before and was really worth to do.... I also noticed that when I reach in the inversion method the C1 colums most of the things were no important at all and erased or dismissed. So finally I did most of C2 left part and only some worth tasks on right C1 column. it is amazing.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter:<br><br><< I thought about this because it tools a long time to reach C2 columns and I was exhausted.>><br><br>I'm not quite clear what the problem is here. Why didn't you just go straight to C2? There's no rule that you have to do any tasks in C1 before going to C2.<br><br>In answer to your original post: Yes, I did try putting C2 on the left and C1 on the right. But I didn't stick with it for two reasons:<br><br>1) it seemed a bit unnatural to start the right hand column before starting the left hand column.<br><br>2) you don't actually achieve anything because you still have to work through C2 on one page before reaching C1 on the next page.  In other words the sequence is still ... C1, C2, C1, C2, C1, C2, C1, C2 ...</div>

<div class="content">@Mark thank you so much for the answer. <br><br>I omit one thing. I tricked the rules. Beginning by C2 and finishing by C1. <br><br>May be because there was a little misunderstand about the appliance of your rules. <br>you said  "There's no rule that you have to do any tasks in C1 before going to C2"  BUT in the rules you said "Continue circulating round page 1 until all tasks in column 2 have been worked on and no more tasks in column 1 feel ready to be worked on. To clarify: you do not have to work on all the tasks in Column 1 but you do have to work on all the tasks in Column" . <br><br>I have always understand yours  rules about SF as DO C1 first then GOTO C2 were all urgent and unfinished tasks are and do them when you can't do anything in C1 and nothing stand at you...<br><br>So did I made a mistake ? I can go directly to C2 and then go back to C1 were all the stuff is ?<br><br>(2) You right whatetever the sequence is still C1, C2, C1, C2 and so on. <br><br>The problem I found with SF is about urgent and unfinished task. <br><br>So this is the reason Why I tricked. In my commercial activities we have to rush and focus on what is the most urgent and important tasks first. i.e. details kills the real results for me. So I tried - but it was just a try - to invert the process and do C2,C1, C2, C1 and so on. <br><br>The result was a strong increasement of the C2 column BUT a real productivity on the most important tasks and finally a lot of major tasks were done. <br><br>More, the C1 column were all the stuff is seems to be like a collector of stuff and only a few tasks became a C2 and lot of C1 tasks becomes crossed and only a little dismissed and I saved a lot of time and energy.<br><br>Of course it is just a test. I did not yet caught the graal.  But I would be interested about your feeling and feelings of the group about my way.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter:<br><br><< So did I made a mistake ? I can go directly to C2 and then go back to C1 were all the stuff is ? >><br><br>Yes, that's right. There's nothing in the instructions to prevent that.<br><br><< So I tried - but it was just a try - to invert the process and do C2,C1, C2, C1 and so on.>><br><br>If you were right in what you thought (which you aren't) you would be doing the left column on the page, then the right column, then the left column on the next page, then the right column on that page, and so on. <br><br>In that case, it wouldn't matter whether the first column is for Ordinary Stuff or for Urgent/Unfinished stuff because whichever it is the sequence would be Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, Urgent/Unfinished, Ordinary, <br><br>and so on.<br><br>As it is, according to the present rules you can move between columns as much as you like, so it really doesn't make any difference which column is on the right and which on the left.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br><< So did I made a mistake ? I can go directly to C2 and then go back to C1 were all the stuff is ? >><br><br>Yes, that's right. There's nothing in the instructions to prevent that.<br><br>The way of beginning and working by either C2 or C1 as a reel good effect on my work. <br>So I finally kept the original presentation i.e. C1 on left part and C2 on the right part. <br><br>And for the processing I began the double reading most often  by C2 and sometime by C1 depends on my mood. <br><br>The result is an increasment of my work and a best result. As I worked on all C2 tasks and red indeed fastly all C1 I can go to the next page very fast and all the most important tasks are done. After I noticed that I crossed 70 % of C1 and 10% has gone in C2 the other 10% is dismissed. I also noticed that working on C2 made me focus on my most important project I did on a batch until nothing could be done. <br><br>So many thanks Mark for this precision about the SF rules. It is very efficient.</div>
