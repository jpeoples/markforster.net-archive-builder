<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-01-22 6:55</div>
<div class="content">I'm happy to report that I've begun using the Auto Focus system - thanks to my colleague Avrum bringing it up time and again on our support calls (miss you Avrum!). I'm also happy to report that I'm getting a lot more done. However, I've seemed to develop what appears to be a bad AF habit. I don't have a lot of time to work the lists, so when I approach them (work/home), I scan through it, as directed, then start the things that jump out at me. I can't bear not to mark items, as they need to be done right away and I'm afraid I'll get distracted with other items. The bad habit is I then start scanning and randomly picking items to work on, cross them off, then when I get back to the book later on, I start randomly picking items again. I can't seem to keep track of where I left off and of which way to scan. <br><br>Believe me, getting this far with focusing on overall tasks is a huge win. However, I'm wondering if there is a quick and easy way to keep track of where I left off, or should I begin at the beginning each time? (I read Revised AF and see there is a Reverse Mode option) but it seems like too rules to follow. I'm a scan sort of person and enjoy just picking out what jumps out, without a lot of rules about it. Maybe I don't have a bad habit after all - or is there a good rationale for breaking this habit now?</div>

<div class="content">I use a stiff-bound portable notepad with two rubber bands. One to mark the page I am processing, the other to mark the final page with entries, so I can instantly flip it open and add items as they come to mind.<br><br>Also the idea is to mark, consider and work on one item at a time.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, good ideas for marking the book. And you hit the nail on the head for "one item at a time". I like to let things swirl around in my mind and I tend to be comfortable with a lot of loose ends. <br><br>However, like Mark F., says it's combining the rational and the intuitive. So far, this is a good thing for me with AF, however, the intuitive takes the lead. Thank you, Laurence.</div>

<div class="content">paperclip, attached to the active task.</div>

<div class="content">And another paperclip for the first open page.<br><br>I actually use three paperclips: one to mark the first open page, one to mark the page where I am entering new tasks (each of these is on the top of the pate), and one to mark the item I'm working on at the moment (on the side of the page).  I've tried the "put a dot next to what you're working on" method but it's not obvious enough for me - I like my supershiny insect-green paperclip better.  (Added bonus: makes it very easy to open the book to the last item I was working on.)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Sarah & Alan for the paper clip idea - I'll try it - to reiterate - that means one can then begin each day where the last paper clipped task is, or begin in a routine way, e.g., reverse mode or forward mode from the beginning... <br><br>Now that I'm typing this, I'm realizing that priorities might have changed overnight and working from the last paper clipped task may no longer be the best approach. Doing the slow scan from the beginning, or end, would then reveal the new most important item to work on. (thanks for indulging my sorting this out publicly).<br><br>Okay, I think I have something to go on here and will carry on. I AM looking forward to the new version that people are talking about and to learning even more about the nuances and little tricks people use to make this system hum. <br><br>Loving it! Thanks again.</div>

<div class="content">Something new I've been doing lately (I saw it on the forum but can't remember where) is copying items to the end of the list before (rather than after) I start work on them. It takes a bit of getting used to but I lose my place less easily.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence, I'm guessing your suggestion is useful because once you add the task to the end, you don't have to flip back again to find where you left off -- thanks for the suggestion. Bev</div>

<div class="content">Here in the UK, 'post it' do a range of 'index flags' in various shapes and sizes, colours and strengths. I use these quite a bit to bookmark things in books and notepads and these would be ideal for this purpose.  They can be reused to an extent so would not be too expensive to use.  They are also flexible, so useful if you have to pop your notebook into a briefcase or bag regularly.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Alison. I tried it and the little flags fall out of my book after a day or two. I like the colors though and I would keep adding new ones if it was a priority. Right now I'm reading through DIT to make sure I'm ready for the DIT update.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Avrum! Are you saying that you haven't read it yet? Seems like AF can stand on it's own - I've been doing "some version" of AF4 for a few weeks without reference to DIT. Although I'm sure I'm not doing it nearly as well as most folks on this forum.</div>
