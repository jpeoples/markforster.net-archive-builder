<div class="content">Is there a more current version of instructions for AF4?<br><br>My version of instructions is dated 5 September 2009 and says:<br><br>"Here are the preliminary instructions for AF4 as demonstrated yesterday. I will write them up in more detail later..."<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>FW</div>

<div class="content">That is still the current version.  Essentially Mark retired from updating his website after that date, although he does still post to the forums.<br><br>If you read the version 1 instructions you will find some explanations that help interpret the rules, but AF4 is what you want.   Be sure to watch Andrea's PDF rendering of Mark's demo.<br><br>After that, the forums have zillions of helpful ideas.  Join the discussion.</div>
