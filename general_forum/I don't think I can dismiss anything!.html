<div class="content">I have been reading the instructions for AF2 with great interest; my only issue is that, due to the nature of my work, I cannot dismiss any task, everything on the list HAS to be done!<br><br>Does anyone have any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">How about doing the things that are marked for dismissal before you must dismiss them? If you don't let the blocks of undone things get too large, it should work out. Since AF2 has no requirement to do a task on each page on the way, you can reach the beginning of the list quickly if the tasks there must be done.</div>

<div class="content">Jason,<br><br>having to dismiss an item doesn't mean that you are not allowed to work on that item.<br><br>You are always allowed to do an dismissed item after re-entering it to your list.<br>But before doing so you should give some thought: "why did this happen?"<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">And of course I forgot the most important thing:<br><br>When you re-enter a dismissed item into your list, break it down to several feasible tasks, don't re-write the same old undoable blob.<br></div>
