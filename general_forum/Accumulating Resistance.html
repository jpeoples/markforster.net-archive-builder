<div class="content">I have a theory that no optimal AF system will be found.  Why:<br><br>Actual work is complex and varied.  A system that tries to accommodate that will always have a certain emphasis and a certain deemphasis.  This bias may be small, but it makes the stuff it favours easier and other stuff harder.  Over time this bias will accumulate as a memory embedded in the pattern of tasks done and not done.  You will start to notice the tasks which don't as easily get tackled within the system, and resistance to these tasks accumulate.  The system will start to bother you just a bit.<br><br>The answer seems to be simple: A good AF system has a slight bias against certain tasks.  As that bias becomes perceptible, bothersome, shift the rules a bit to bias in favor of those tasks.The problem melts away, as those tasks get cleared and a new bias becomes evident.  <br><br>If I'm right, then the ultimate autofocus is the one in which the rules change (very slightly) from month to month according to the situation.<br><br>Having said that, I believe SFv3 is better than everything that preceded it because of its smooth blending of urgent and unfinished tasks.  But even SF isn't optimal.  The problems are smaller, and regular small adjustments will keep it effective.</div>

<div class="content">That is sound theory, Alan. You make a good case.<br><br>But don't forget about all the adjustments we can make without even touching the rules, by tinkering with project management and phrasing.<br><br>For example, maybe I've been resisting "read War & Peace," using Mark's approach of keeping it interminably in C2, and I hypothesize that it's due to not breaking the project into small tasks. Then I experiment with "read W&P for an hour," but that doesn't fly either, so I try "read W&P 20 pages." Eventually, I discover that the optimal phrase is, "read W&P one paragraph," which typically results in frequent reading sessions of 45 minutes each.<br><br>Or, suppose I am in the (accidental) habit of writing one action per project on my list. And suppose several of my projects are stuck because each of their single actions is highly resistable. Through dismissal, I catch on to this, so I begin writing as many options as possible for stuck projects, including mutually exclusive options such as "buy red notebook" and "buy blue notebook," or "call Bob with bad news" and "email Bob with bad news."<br><br>More freedom exists in SF's lack of a requirement to finish tasks before crossing them off. I tend to forget, especially in C2, that I can move to the next page just by "actioning" those items, rather than completing them all the way. Endless little games can be made out of this. We can say that when a task has been in C2 for longer than we'd like, we will start working it in strictly limited ten minute blocks, etc. When the timer rings, I *must* stop and cross it out ... then sit back and watch the power of reverse psychology!<br><br>It would take me a long time to play with all those combinations before I got around to the rules themselves.<br><br>But broadly speaking, yes, these sorts of adjustments are an essential part of running SuperFocus.</div>

<div class="content">I don't think the tasks are what create the resistance -- and I don't think it's the way theyare written, either.   I think it's the way they are *framed*.  And the *rules* determine how they are framed.<br><br>In Mark Forster's case, he's finding that the obligation to clear C2 before moving to the next page is creating resistance to those C2 tasks, and ultimately to the whole system.   Why even pick up the SF notebook, when you KNOW there are those nasty tasks waiting there that you MUST clear before you can really do anything else?   Hmm, maybe I'll go read a book or go for a walk or surf the Internet for a few minutes first, and THEN open my book.   Oops.<br><br>In my case, with AF1, I was always chasing the end of the list, never cycling back to the beginning, and thus never getting repeated exposure to the tasks, and never triggering dismissal.  I became numb to the whole list as a result, and was always in a state of anxiety.  I relied on Outlook reminders as a backup to remind me of deadlines.   It just became unworkable.<br><br>With DWM, I almost always cycled through the first 7 days (from TODAY through TODAY+7) and never got past that.   So, it was essentially the same problem as AF1 -- too many things, not seeing them often enough, not cycling fast enough.  DWM got the job done more reliably, because I could always make something "urgent" by entering it at TODAY+7.  But it lost the intuitive feel and "flow" of AF.  It still "worked" more effectively than other systems I'd tried -- but it became dull and monotonous, and I often became numb to it overall.  <br><br>In all three of these examples, the system is what ultimately creates the resistance -- not the tasks.  And I'm not convinced it's impossible to address those various problems by introducing new or modified rules.<br><br>The reason I think it's possible is because Mark has already achieved success several times.<br><br>For example, with AF1, there was no effective mechanism to handle urgency.  Thus a "common sense override" had to be invoked frequently.  This led to lack of trust in the system, and ultimately, to resistance to using the system overall (at least, for those who had lots of urgent things to deal with).  One could get by only with various external supports such as Outlook reminders or "today" lists or whatever.   Mark fixed that by introducing Column 2 for urgent tasks.   This fix alone went very far in achieving a balance between "urgent" and "important" that AF1 was not able to achieve.<br><br>That's just one example, of course, and there are many others.  With each turn of the TM crank, Mark keeps finding new innovative ways to address these systemic issues.  <br>Personally, I don't have a resistance problem with C2, at least not yet.  If I do feel resistance, I remind myself that I just need to take action, not actually finish anything.  That's enough to help me push through a long C2 list.  Also, I always reserve the right to declare a task "done for now" -- I usually find that there's a reason why I'm resisting one of these C2 tasks, and the reason is that the raison d'etre of that task has changed in some significant way, and when that happens, it's "done for now" -- it's really turned into something new.  <br><br>Maybe I'll develop more resistance later, or maybe find some other aspect of the system that starts pushing back at me.   But I would expect these trouble spots to be issues with the SYSTEM, not issues with the way I am writing tasks.   As Bernie wrote, these systems already encourage you to experiment with different ways of writing tasks to find whatever works for you.  The more difficult problems arise when, no matter how you write your tasks, the system starts to get stuck somewhere and you can't make progress, you can't get into the flow.</div>

And I would also claim that all systems that have any value whatsoever seem especially good in the first week or so.  That's why when people (myself included) say "hey this system is great!  I've had two really productive days so far!" it is no indication whatsoever of that system's long-term value.</div>

<div class="content">Essentially, I am agreeing with all this.<br><br>My one reservation is that some of us need *not* be told to tinker with the rules, or we will gladly tinker away the hours in the name of productivity. I would rather leave the rules as a very, very last resort. After all, with sufficiently extensive rule changes, I could end up with some two-column version of GTD that includes a "Tomorrow" context.<br><br>In a really good system, the rules are so generally enabling that you forget you are following them. David Allen (ironically) gives the example of lines on the road. We may jockey around with options for passing, what speed to go,when to turn, but we take the lines for granted. They are so valuable in creating freedom of movement (by eliminating oncoming traffic from our lane) that we wouldn't want to mess with them.<br><br>SuperFocus always seemed like that sort of system to me, so this is why I am loath to endorse ongoing rule changes. For example, I have noticed that Mark's newest "parking" variation is essentially what I had created by framing my projects a certain way. It is more direct and natural using his rule change, but the neat thing is that I was able to get there without "breaking the rules." I do think we should experiment to discover good rules (as Mark continues to do), but it will really help if the rules end up fixed once discovered.<br><br>I would liken all this to the cross-training or plateauing that occurs in fitness and exercise. Even on a healthy, effective routine, there will be blind spots, and your body will eventually adapt to slow further change. Many athletes rotate amongst two or three favorite regimens, but they avoid the distraction of endlessly experimenting on themselves.<br><br>Perhaps, rather than "changing the rules," we can rotate occasionally amongst our three favorite variations? For some, there is no distinction here, but for others (ahem) this is rather crucial.</div>

<div class="content">I think no perfect  system will be found, because no one can predict all of the possible issue one will need it to address, but one can find an optimal system if they design one to address the issues specific to their situation.  I have never found a system designed by anyone else to work better than a system I designed myself.  I may have picked up some ideas and incorporated them into my system, but off the shelf nothing has been effective for me.  The other thing I have found is the simpler a system, the better it works and the longer it is embraced.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>I think what is needed is an objective criteria by which you can meassure the influence a system has in your performance. Feeling "stuck", feeling "flowing" is too volatile, and only secondary to achieving your goals.<br><br>I haven't found yet any comparative study, or even any individual report, on results achieved using different systems.</div>

<div class="content">Marcelo,<br><br>It would be very difficult to measure, but of course you are right the true measure of a system is how much of the right stuff we get done.  My TM systems were designed to make my work life productive, while my goal achievement system was one I used to knock out a few important goals in life.  If you run across such a study I would love to see it.  Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Punctually, such a comparison can be easily made: Alan has to do his taxes. He can do them this year applying the principle of “little and often”, computing how much time it took him by adding up all the instances he sat with this task. Next year he can do the taxes applying the three tasks method, or just in one seating, computing how long it took him.  Then he will have an objective measure of how long takes him to do the taxes using each method. Assuming he wants to spend the less time possible doing his taxes, he will know which method is better for this task.  He can reasonably extend the validity of this conclusion to similar tasks.</div>

Yes, I've been trying some minor variants to help me move more quickly through the list, and found some that seem to help.  Each adjustment gets closer and closer to a stable, productive, useful system that keeps operating smoothly without further correction.  Perhaps the approach to that goal is asymptotic but can that be proved?  <br><br>It seems like a general negative so I suppose it can be neither proved nor disproved.<br><br>Let's say Mark tries out this latest variant for awhile, and then he stays with it for a couple years with no more changes.   This neither proves nor disproves your hypothesis -- you could say "it's just a matter of time -- there WILL be changes eventually".

<div class="content">I don't think taxes would be a particularly good example. The complexity of one's tax return may vary wildly from year to year, so it's not possible to compare one year with another. And is the speed at which the tax return is completed a good measure in any case? Inefficient time management might lead you to leave your tax return to the last minute so that you have to rush it. <br><br>And of course one year you might have little else to do, so the tax return can take priority. The next year you might be in the middle of the most exciting phase of development of your business, so that the tax return has to have space found for it. You might do the tax return faster the first year, but the second year it might be the efficiency of your time management system that gets it done at all.<br><br>The same sort of considerations apply to most other tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster:<br><br>Thank you for answering!<br><br>Here is another example, less variable from one occurrence to another: painting a room: little and often and as much as I want, or in one “seating”?<br><br>As for the taxes report: in my experience, running a little business with no employees (secretarial services are outsourced) and no stock of merchandise, this is the most efficient way I found: during the year I file the deductible expenses by the categories required in the income annual report. When the time for the annual report comes, I only need to add up the expenses, the income as per the VAT monthly reports, do a few more calculations  (car and equipment amortization, etc) and that’s it. In a couple of hours it is done.  The method here is not little and often and as much as I want, but timely and as much as the task requires to be done (I hope the accountant terms I am using are clear, I don’t live in an English speaking country neither am an English speaking person, so I am not familiar with them).<br><br>In the example I brought above, painting a room, I hope it will be evident that the preparations required for painting (moving/covering furniture) and the cleaning afterwards (dusk that goes all over the room, brushes, etc) will make the “little and often and as much as you want” approach  very inefficient.<br><br>What I am trying to point at is that for a system to be efficient it must relate to the specific task at hand, alternating approaches as fits the nature of the task.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-04-7 21:22</div>
<div class="content">I agree that there are fast and slow ways to achieve some tasks.  There's also the matter of actually getting the project done.  For example there's a lot of preparation for painting a room.  In all:<br>- clean room, move furniture, buy paint, brushes, tape things, cover things, paint, let dry, paint again, let dry, clean up put away, wash up, put the room back in order.<br><br>That takes a full day done all at once, and further requires advanced planning to ensure you have a full day available.  For some people it might never happen that way.<br><br>The AutoFocus approach typically might take a week to accomplish the same project.  But other stuff will also be done in that same week.  It won't be as efficient overall, but it may in fact get done sooner because you don't have to wait until you can dedicate a day.</div>

<div class="content">Those are great points, Alan.<br><br>In the past, I tended to look for "efficiency" by waiting to free up long blocks of time and then attack this sort of project in one shot. The result of all this "efficiency" was a long list of tasks that never got done, because I rarely succeeded in freeing those long blocks: "Oh, I don't have time to do this pet project now, so I'll just filter through some junk mail, change a light bulb, and reconcile some bank statements." Incidentally, one of those big projects was GTD's week-long startup marathon.<br><br>To get those longer projects done, we can sacrifice efficiency for the sake of completion. Perhaps less "work" is done per unit time, but more of what's done is important.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster:<br><br>It is not the "little and often" approach alone though what makes this efficient. Someone may file the receipts during the year in a general A-Z filing system. By the time of the annual report he will have to search through the files for the receipts, select the deductible ones and organize them by categories, before proceeding. So even inside the "little and often" approach things can be done more or less efficiently.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using something like that shoebox method ever since I discovered Mark's books and his "file in order of last accessed" method.  It's been such a relief not to file everything compulsively A-Z.   <br><br>I still do apply a greater level of rigor and order when filing permanent records (official documents, employment records, educational records, goat registrations, automobile titles and records, etc.).   But most everything else gets thrown into an annual "box" and I haven't regretted it once.   It saves so much time and headache, and has helped me get over the compulsive need to see all my files in perfect alphabetical order.</div>

<div class="content">Start with the end in mind. It all depends on what are you filing for. <br><br>Vanilla folders are (almost) as simple to use as a box, and save all the sorting and classifying at the end. It's done.<br><br>The first year I gave everthing to an accountant - it was too expensive for my turnover. The second year I did it myself. Took too much time, also too expensive - only it wasn't an expense, it was an investment. I learned how to do the report, figured out how to do it next year, and since then it's not an issue anymore.</div>

<div class="content">In general, the cost to a company is twice the employee's salary. This includes insurance, taxes, floor-space, boss's time, and more. So even though an outside bookkeeper seems expensive, an engineer's time is even more expensive. And, as Marcelo pointed out, the cost of training in a different field and the slower-speed of the non-expert.. Then there's the cost of the work only the engineer can do, that isn't being done.<br><br>That's not to say you shouldn't invest in learning the forms yourself and building speed, just that sometimes the hidden costs are larger than we realize.<br><br>My rule for filing is compare time spent filing with time spent searching, modified by importance of document. Some rarely-used documents (like the forms Seraphim mentioned) are worthy of more filing time. Also modified by time spent reviewing before throwing out.<br><br>Any receipt that I can throw out after a year or less goes in an envelope by month. It's not worth subdividing to "after shows on statement" and "keep for 90 day warranty". I spend maybe 15 minutes a month looking through those. After a year they go into storage, and after another year I throw out the whole box without even opening it.<br><br>Monthly statements go into one of three piles (bank, investment, utility) and properly sorted and bound (stapled) by month sometime after year end. The folders never get more than an inch thick, and the statements are already printed on coloured letterhead.</div>
