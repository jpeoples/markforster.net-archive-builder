<div class="content">One year ago today Mark demonstrated AF4 to this audience.  It was immediately a hit.<br><br>When I discovered this method, it changed my work life from semi-chaotic to semi-controlled.  In the past year, I've gained experience with using and adapting the system.  Many people moved on to DWM but I found AF4 was closer to my ideal.<br><br>After 6 months of using AF4 essentially as written, I started tweaking a bit to get something that better suits my circumstances.  Many tweaks just made things worse, It seems that AF4 is something of a local optimum.  AF4 works great, but if you change any one rule, it simply works worse.<br><br>I am now congealing to variant I'm extremely pleased with, but that's for another thread.  This one is to say AF4 has been a wonderful discovery for me, and say thanks to Mark.</div>

<div class="content">Happy birthday indeed! AF4 has definitely changed how I work; it has made me much more efficient, but more importantly has made me more relaxed, knowing that everything I need to get done is in one place, and that the rules, and my intuition, will sort out the important things and the dross.<br><br>My one   tweak has been to add a DWM expiry date next to each item, and follow that dismissal rule along with the closed list rule of AF4. These rules together ensure for me that the right things get done in time.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Happy Birthday AF4!<br><br>I have been using a variant of AF4 for the past 2 or 3 weeks, which allows the processing of not just individual tasks but also projects AND maintenance works.  And it works BEAUTIFULLY *sigh*<br><br>I will probably post in a week or two how it works, but in the meantime, let us celebrate!</div>

<div class="content">Unnhh . . . I can't believe it . . . I just posted that I had come back to AF1 and then I read Alan's post and realised I never really gave AF4 a proper trial and he makes it sound so good and I'm thinking maybe  . . . just maybe . . . AF4 has everything I like about AF1 plus something more . . . but can I really be so fickle??<br><br>Yes, I can.  I am starting AF4 as of today.  Must stick to it for a month.  Must treat it with respect - the same respect I had for AF1 when I first tried it - which I haven't really done with any other system since.  <br><br>Thank you, Alan, for making me think again about AF4!<br><br>acedia xx</div>

<div class="content">@Veghead...<br>"add DWM Expiry date next to each item..." Would you please clariy this... do you mean you would enter a task and then put +30 date behind it?  Then dismiss it at that date?  Or do you put today's date +7 after each task you've worked?   Just curious.  This tweak is very interesting.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym, I could have written your post myself.  I feel I have solved project and maintenance tasks, too.  Yet I bet your solution is completely different from mine.  I'll have to wait and see.<br><br>acedia, what I like about AF4 is how it balanced urgent tasks with neglected tasks.  I never tried AF1 but my impression of the rules, and my reading of this forum suggested that AF1 didn't deal well with urgent stuff.  I didn't like the idea of looping through every page when the last page had important stuff I had to get to.<br><br>AF4 only has one list you must loop through, and it wasn't too hard to escape to the open list to work on stuff.  Plus the rewriting of tasks on the open list meant you could also easily iterate a small set of tasks repeatedly.  AF1 didn't do this.</div>

<div class="content">Nice to read praises for AF4, tweaked or otherwise. I've struggled with my own choices and AF4 on paper (office at front and home at the back) has resonated the best with me. For a while AF2 worked like a charm, and that was when I had a lot of fires to put out. It handled the urgent stuff well but when things got a little less hectic, I found that the back items were not handled well.<br><br>I've given DWM a fair chance, both on paper and electronic, but  for various reasons, it has just not worked well for me.<br><br>Look forward to reading your tweaks, Alan and Nuntym and thanks Alan for a thread that helps put my own journey into perspective. Veghead, I like your DWM-type tweak, will give it a go.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ms,<br><br>I follow the DWM rules as written, every new task is expiry +30, when I make progress and reenter it is expiry +7.<br><br>But I also follow AF4 rules-- using the line to mark off a closed and open list-- if no task gets hit on one pass of the closed list, those tasks are gone, and the open list becomes a closed one.<br><br>And I do kill DWM tasks that outlive their expiry date, but that happens rarely.. More often, I make sure that tasks set to expire that day get hit. <br><br>Hope this helps. I am doing this electronically with Excel so it is easy for me to follow both AF4 and DWM on the same list.</div>

<div class="content">Happy Birthday indeed... <br><br>I too return with a big helping of humble pie. After getting into a big mess I am now back onto AF4 & feeling more in control again. I'm still using Gerry's Do It technique seperately as one criticism I have about AF is that it is possible to start drowning in trivia whilst neglecting bigger, more important goals.</div>

<div class="content">I agree it's possible to drown in trivia.  So I have on my list several things like "consider bigger, more important goals."  <br><br>Now as a list item that doesn't get you very far by itself.  But I have a page associated with that task and I use a filtered stream of consciousness where I write some stuff about goals, think some more, write what comes to mind, examine current activities etc.  <br><br>The result of such thought may be a page reminding me what's important.  I might also create new tasks that help me get goals in action, or delete tasks that don't contribute, or at least change my mindset so the non-goal stuff on the list no longer steals my attention.</div>

<div class="content">It's quite remarkable I've stuck to AF4 so long.  I've never kept any previous system going for more than a couple months. Before AF4 I've tried: <br><br>GTD - several times.  My perfectionist tendencies, combined with a lack of disciplined review, made this impossible. <br>DateBk for Palm - okay but overwhelming trying to fit all the stuff in the tiny screen.<br>LifeBalance - PC/Palm.  Really nice until my Palm broke.  Tried doing GTD w/ this.<br>- Plain wall calendars, pocket calendars, day-timers<br>- Scheduling systems<br><br>Most of my life I managed without a system.  I did okay, but forgot important details like homework assignments, bills due, etc.  The same happened in July when I fell off for a month.<br><br>Now my home implementation recently became an A4-size report folder at home, I keep 4 loose leaf pages in it.  I also have a "projects" binder.  I expect I can stick to this indefinitely.<br><br>At work I have OneNote, which I've used since day one.  Incredible for me, as I've never stuck to any other organizing medium like this one before.  It always ended up messy and unbearable after a while, but this still works for me.</div>

<div class="content">Happy birthday AF4 ! you brought us so much....<br>Incredible I still stuck with the system. Why ? because it works for me. <br>I work a bit like Alan, and added a lot of tips coming from GTD but for me the system works perfectly. I tried it on paper and digitaly and whatever I tried it still works. It works with many kind of software taskpaper, word, .txt , omnifocus, web system, google notes,  A4, A5 sheet, diary, notesbook, pocket notesbooks. It solves urgency, long term and exhausting projects.<br>Of course i met some difficulties, forgot things here and there but the reason was not about the system itself but because I did not stuck to the system. <br><br>Thanks again  to MF for this marvelous system. Hope he is happy with his retirement.</div>

<div class="content">I am intrigued about the edits to AF4 to manage projects?  I'm hoping that these can be posted up here - I get involved in a lot of projects so this would be really useful.<br><br>I think that the system works so well becuase it is easy to use and implement - the more complex the system to less likely I am to use it!</div>

<div class="content">Totally agree with Alison.  The key for me is that I don't have to think where to write new entries and - most of the time - I don't worry too much where to start working from either.  <br><br>Of course, all time management systems work best when one has plenty of time to do one's work.  Where AF scores over most other systems, is that it is so easy to pick up again after interruptions - no need to reassess priorities or shuffle due dates in order to get up and running again. <br><br>At the end of a bad week, I am very happy to have returned to AF.<br><br>acedia</div>
