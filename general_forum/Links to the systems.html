<div class="content">Because of the organic growth of the systems on this site, it's very difficult to find the basic instructions for them all, even for me.<br><br>So in this thread you are invited to do a bit of detective work and see if you can find the links. You don't have to do them all, even one will help. Once I've got a good number I'll open a permanent web page where they can be found easily.<br><br>Please post results on this thread. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Well, first, all the systems up through Superfocus already have all the links to instructions in one place - the "Review of the Systems" tag under the Archive tag. If you want those linked individually here, someone would just have to go through those blog posts (all conveniently already in one place) and copy and paste them. Maybe I will later or maybe someone else will. For now I'll just link to the tag, and I'll go ahead and add a few newer links that come to mind.<br><br>Review of the Systems (everything till Superfocus): <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/review-of-systems" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/review-of-systems</a><br><br>Final Version and alternative FV: <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109980854493.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109980854493.html</a><br><br>Spinning Plates: <a href="../blog/The Spinning Plates Method of Project Control (Experimental).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/3/30/the-spinning-plates-method-of-project-control-experimental.html</a><br><br>Remelsbach (a.k.a.

<div class="content">I didn't mean I've done a lot of exploring to find these links or search for old systems - That was easy. I just mean in the couple years I've been reading this website, I've done a lot of reading, so there probably isn't a system on here I'm not aware of.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I've been reading your site for years and have enjoyed trying out almost all of your systems.  The ideas from the posters on this forum have also been superb over the years.  Your site is the one productivity site that  I keep coming back to check in and see what is new.<br><br>Have you ever considered releasing audiobooks of your printed books?  It's probably something that could be fairly easily monetized.<br><br>Also, you have a ton of material that could be turned into a podcast via iTunes.  A lot of people listen to downloaded podcasts as they commute or go about their daily activity.   I'm not sure a podcast is easy to monetize, but it could generate interest in your books.<br><br>Just some thoughts.  I am sure you have lots of other useful projects with which to fill your time. <br><br>All the best,<br><br><br>Paul</div>

<div class="content">Paul B:<br><br>Thanks for the suggestions. I have thought of these things, but I am retired these days and this blog and the other materials are quite low priorities for me (even it doesn't always feel like it!).<br><br>The same applies to the money. The amount I'd be likely to make through these activities is no longer attractive enough to pull me away from the other things I'm interested in.</div>
