<div class="content">In addition to the 'productivity' challenge, I like trying to do another behavioral challenge.<br><br>I will do a challenge I find myself doing every other year, I think, which is to give up listening to podcasts. I listen to them in the car, commuting, doing the dishes, making my coffee, walking around the lake, etc. It makes my head more crowded than it should be, I think, even though I'm often only half-listening.<br><br>During previous Lenten periods I replaced the podcasts with audiobooks, usually novels. I listened to "Mrs. Dalloway" on my last podcast-fast and it was glorious. But after Lent, I fell back into my podcast-gorging ways.<br><br>So I will aim to do this challenge again. I'm bargaining with myself whether to go cold-turkey: no music, no audiobooks, just me -- or allow music or audiobooks, just shed the podcasts. Haven't decided that yet.<br><br>Anyone else giving up something for Lent?</div>

<div class="content">I don't have any lent plans, but regarding podcasts I do listen to a lot (now even), and I feel it is valuable to have times when I have no information input at all.  At least for 1/2 hour, but occasionally for many hours.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I'm going to do some Lent "extra bits".<br><br>For me, I feel great satisfaction when I do a schedule of tasks in chrono order without skipping or deferring any tasks and work them all to a completion. i.e. actually do from start to finish exactly what I have planned and not tempted by any new or other distracting tasks etc.<br><br>So, I'm going to give that a go and see if I can do something like 100 straight tasks one after the other with blinkers on!</div>

<div class="content">Mr. Done: A more viable method is<br>1) Do as many as you feel like.  Count.<br>2) After a break see if you can do that many plus 1.<br><br>It seems like this can stretch your endurance, but whether or not 100 is feasible depends how hard your task mix is.</div>

<div class="content">I think it's bound to fail because the number of tasks is irrelevant and not an indication of endurance, but rather a game; an engineered distraction from the work that, on some level, you already know you need to define and get on with.</div>

<div class="content">MrDone:<br><br>The problem with doing 100 straight tasks in order, even if you are extremely well-disciplined, is that life gets in the way unless you are in an extremely structured and repetitive job.<br><br>However if I was going to attempt to do it purely as an exercise - which I'm not - I'd use some supporting techniques. As well as the one Alan Baljeu suggests, I'd use some form of time boxing. <br><br>Another effective technique allows for a slight deviation in order. You compare the first task with the second one and do the one that stands out. Then compare the one you didn't do with the next task and repeat. Carry on to the end of the list using the same method. Except for the last task of all, you are always doing the easier of two tasks - and as resistance is relative it will carry you through.<br><br>But I suspect that Chris is right to suspect that you are engaging in an engineered distraction.</div>
