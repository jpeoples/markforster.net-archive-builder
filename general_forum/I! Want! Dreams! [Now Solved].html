<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-10-22 22:59</div>
<div class="content">(Sorry for the headline, but I wanted to generate some attention.) <br><br>It's about Mark's second book "How to Make Your Dreams Come True". As everybody knows, this book is sold out, there will be no reprint and Mark is planning to release it as a (free?) ebook. <br><br>At the moment, the ebook is not yet available, however, and even if it were, I'd still prefer an old-fashioned paperback. <br><br>What makes me write yet another (I already did one) post about this is that I had some weird experiences with Amazon.co.uk's "Marketplace". (Important information: I live in Germany.)  <br> <br>So far, I've tried to buy the "Dreams" book numerous times (in addition to what I already wrote on another occasion). At one point in time, it suddenly reappeared as available by Amazon.co.uk, but an order I placed went unanswered (unlike the earlier attempt where at least I got a negative one), and it was listed as "out of stock" again. Then, I tried to buy a "new" or at least "used - good" copy from a third-party vendor via Amazon UK's "Marketplace". (BTW, the book never appears on Amazon .com or .de "Marketplace", only in the UK.) I've bought books from both Amazon's UK and US sites and their "Marketplace" sections before to be shipped to me in Germany, and never had any problems. But this time, it was very different. Every time I tried to order the book (I tried this every time I found a copy offered for less than £ 15 plus shipping, which would be my upper limit), I got to some point in the ordering procedure where I was suddenly told that the item cannot be dispatched to the address I entered. There was no indication before that it would only be shipped inside the UK. I don't know if this is a change in Amazon UK's policies, or if it is some kind of database error. The weirdest part of it all is that those offers always disappeared totally after my mishaps. <br>A question to Amazon's support about this phenomenon went unanswered. I can't say that I was surprised. <br>It looks like they decided to neither sell anything nor even talk to non-Brits anymore.<br><br>To make a long story short: Is there a nice soul in the UK willing to risk some quid (£ 15 plus shipping max), buy it for me, let me send over the money and re-ship it to my address in Germany? <br><br>Please send your answer to: alxwz.test AT gmail.com (please note that the ".test" part is real, unlike the spaces, and the "AT" is meant to be replaced by you-know-what; all these hoops due to spammers' addess harvesting, of course, sorry). <br><br>Thanks in advance, <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">All my queries to Amazon's support remain unanswered too - or at best a form reply totally unrelated to my query - so I don't think they are discriminating against non-UK residents in that respect at least!</div>

<div class="content">I tried to order this book and initially received the same message at the amazon.co.uk site about them not being able to dispatch (I love that British term!) to my address in the US.  It was a used copy from a third-party seller.  So I just chose another seller (daisybankbooks) who specifically displayed a message about shipping to international addresses.  This time the order went through.  According to the website, the order is still in process.  So I hope and expect to receive the book.<br><br>Incidentally, my query to Amazon support was answered with a statement that some of the 3rd-party vendors do not ship to international addresses, and are set up to trigger that message that we both received.<br><br>Best of luck in getting a copy of the book!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex<br><br>I was going to say the same as Walter that it needs to say on a Marketplace listing that the seller will specifically do "international shipping". However, I was trying to track down an elusive art book and managed to find an affordable copy on Canadian Amazon. I noticed that the seller didn't show international shipping so I emailed her (via the contact seller system on the Website) and she very kindly modified the listing so that I could buy it. The only risk with this is that another buyer could sneak in and buy it before you manage to but if you find a helpful seller who will modify their listing to sell to you by adding international shipping then it might be worth a try.<br><br>Good luck - I hope you find a copy soon...</div>

<div class="content">I must be particularly lucky or something but I have to say I have pretty much always had helpful responses from Amazon support. They even helped me to get a partial refund when a seller refused to accept that a mint copy of a book should mean mint and if it isn't mint then the price should be dropped accordingly. <br><br>However, I have sometimes had to be persistent in explaining what I mean or chasing them if I don't hear back from them straight away - although this can confuse them when my emails and their responses overlap!</div>

<div class="content">Actually, I tried to contact one of the vendors, but got no reply from them either.</div>

<div class="content">Walter, Hannah, <br><br>thanks for your comments about international shipping. <br>Right now, I'm waiting for an shipment to arrive where international delivery was stated as available. <br><br>Let's look and see.</div>

<div class="content">Success! <br><br>The book arrived today! <br>Thanks for the hints about international delivery. <br><br>Mark, since I cannot edit the thread subject or delete/edit my initial post, may I ask you to either edit the subject to something like "[Solved:] ..." or delete the whole thread?<br><br>Kind regards, <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Congratulations on your success, Alex. I hope you find the book valuable.<br><br>I think the contents of the thread might be of use to others, so I have put [Now Solved] in the title.</div>
