<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Here's something I've been wondering:<br><br>My first open page has 11 open items. Crossed out items are mixed in. If no item gets actioned it will take 6 days for all these items to end up in Review.<br><br>For the past few days, I have decided to switch to forward mode. I take one look at this page, say thanks but no thanks to all the items, then move back to reverse mode.<br><br>Am I understanding the rule correctly that unless I take an action on this first page I cannot move to the second page? And if I don't want to action anything here I have to wait 6 more days before I can go forward on page 2? <br><br>And if this is true, is it a bug or a feature? I want to try forward AF so much, I guess I will bite the bullet and do something on page one even though I don't want to....<br><br>Guess I answered my own question!</div>

<div class="content">vhj,<br><br>Yes, I think it is a feature. Just as you say, you have to bite the bullet and do at least SOMETHING on at least ONE of the items on that page. <br><br>Of course, as Mr. Forster mentioned in another thread on these forums, one has the ability to completely delete items before they even come up for review if one knows these items are unactionable (i.e. circumstances change, you already did it, you don't want to do it anymore, someone else did it). <br><br>The caveat, I suppose, is that one must be careful of the PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER of being able to just delete an item from the list, because one might be using that technique as a way to procrastinate or to otherwise undermine the review process of AF.<br><br>Anyone have any thoughts on the above? Am I on the right track?<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">veg, I think you are assuming that you will not want to do any of those page 1 tasks for the next week. Why is that? Is it an assumption or more of a concern? If it's the latter, try to trust that your intuition will tell you what is the best thing to do and when. Remember that using reverse mode in no way prohibits you from reaching page 2 in a timely fashion. When I am feeling this way, I very quickly skim backward through the list until I hit those page 2 tasks that are now begging to be done.</div>

What you should be doing is reading the items on the page through once, then going through them again one by one to see if one feels ready to be done.<br><br>Assuming that you *are* doing it correctly, then Mel has picked up the salient fact that you have eleven items on the page which you are convinced you are not going to do for the next six days. If you *know* you are not going to do them, then delete them all completely and have done with it. This is not a matter of waiting until the items come up for review. There's no point in reviewing them since you know you are not going to do them. Delete them for good and all.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the responses, they had great insight.<br><br>Mark: "What you should be doing is reading the items on the page through once, then going through them again one by one to see if one feels ready to be done."<br><br>Me: You are right, that i was not doing this correctly. I had forgotten this aspect of Forward (AF1) mode, and what a difference it makes. In Reverse mode, I don't read through the items, I just quickly go backwards, saying, "not now" ""not now" until "Yes, now" when I hit the next item I am going to do. It is so interesting how the mentality of Forward mode is different than Reverse.<br><br>Mel "veg, I think you are assuming that you will not want to do any of those page 1 tasks for the next week. Why is that? Is it an assumption or more of a concern?"<br><br>Me: You are right. By focing myself to slow down and look at each item individually, considiering whyu I am not doing it, I bit the bullet and did a few.<br><br>Joseph: "Yes, I think it is a feature. Just as you say, you have to bite the bullet and do at least SOMETHING on at least ONE of the items on that page."<br><br>Me: I'm living proof, it is indeed a feature :) <br><br>Thanks all!<br><br></div>
