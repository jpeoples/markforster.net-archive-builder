<div class="content">Each time management system has it's own overhead. The system helps you to use your energy to do tasks, but it uses part of the energy to run itself. The more complex is the system, the bigger is the overhead. So simplicity is the key. To reach simplicity we have to reduce number of types of objects we operate with and number of operations we do with them.<br><br>GTD has a lot of different objects: <br>-tasks in "bucket"<br>-tasks assigned for some date<br>-waitin tasks<br>-current projects<br>-maybe probject<br>-5 levels of planning<br>etc tec<br> <br>It also has a number of operations:<br>-complex procedure of emptying of incoming bucket<br>-procedure of task executing  <br>-reviews: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly<br><br>etc etc<br><br>So the system is very complex, overhead of running it is very big, it saps all the energy it is supposed to organize.<br><br>DIT is simple and AF is even simpler.<br>DIT has three kind of objects:<br>-planned tasks<br>-new tasks (under the line)<br>-Current Initiative<br><br>AF has only one type of object: a task, and very few operations with it.<br><br>I can't imagine a system that would have less complexity and less overhead than AF. It's the champion! :) <br><br>P.S. "Ttoday" index card increases complexity, so it is a god news, that it' abandoned.</div>

<div class="content">To be fair, AF does not address things like planning and filing and managing one's inbox, etc.  It need not.  But those things still must be done and AF's not dealing with them does not make life simpler ... it just makes AF simpler, as it were.<br><br>Where AF shines is that it does not create things to do that don't have to be done.  Context lists are an example of that.  They are system overhead which a better system does not introduce.</div>

<div class="content">But the great thing about AF is that it *can* be used to manage planning, filing, email etc but in a totally easy and non-threatening way, in that it enables us to identify the systems that work best for us and to assimilate them into AF.</div>

<div class="content"><br>Reason why I'm supporting the idea of ONE long list is that it makes AF simple. If you have multiple lists => distraction & overhead!<br></div>
