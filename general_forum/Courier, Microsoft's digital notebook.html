<div class="content">This might drag a number of the hardcore pen-and-paper people to the dark side:<br><br>a digital notebook like none-other:<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WYWGKnVkEw&feature=player_embedded" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WYWGKnVkEw&feature=player_embedded</a><br><br>Call it what you want, it is a microsoft product, but it's genius</div>

<div class="content">It is also pure vaporware.</div>

<div class="content">And yet if they did not show it now, they'd be so completely wiped out by the iPad.  I wonder when it will actually be available.<br><br>It seems to be a special purpose device ... IOW, is not application oriented.  That seems to be both its power and a big limitation.  It also limits its appeal, I would think.<br><br>I also note that you get the closeup rather than see a person holding it to get an idea of its size.<br><br>Questions, questions ;-)</div>

<div class="content">There are more similar videos, one of them says each screen will be a 7" screen, I hope it may be available in 28 or 10", but 7" should be ok as a portable device and provided the handwriting works as shown.  Touch Screen does NOT mean ability to write on the screen!<br><br>I have had a tablet for some years, but it's just too unwieldy to use in tablet mode all the time.  I was hoping one of the imminent tablet notebooks would have practical handwriting, but only the Asus seems to have a stylus.<br><br>In addition to handwriting capability, I wanted a netbook device for using in flights (cattle class, coach), meetings etc.  I've not waited and this week bought a Toshiba NB305 netbook in the UK, nice bit of kit, battery lasts in excess of 10 hours.  I will be upgrading the RAM to 2 Gb, installing Windows & Professional (to run non Windows 7 software like my accounting system among other things) and then sync with my bigger notebook as necessary.<br><br>The Courier shown is that MS should have evolved to since 2003.  It does the things I want to have, not the entertainment focus on the iPad.<br><br>I'll watch and wait, and see if all the questions, questions get answered.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, this article shows at least some hands in the picture to get an idea of size. <br><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/photos-and-details-of-microsofts-digital-journal-tablet-unveiled-1917188.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/photos-and-details-of-microsofts-digital-journal-tablet-unveiled-1917188.html</a></div>

<div class="content">This is the purest fantasy, what MS have announced is a concept. This thing does not exist yet and all films and 'photos' are just mockups.</div>

<div class="content">They forgot to include the inexplicable clock icons that appear out of nowhere and hang everything for 90 seconds, and the images of the stuff you were dragging across the screen getting stuck mid-way and hanging the system, requiring a restart.<br><br>But otherwise it looks great!</div>

<div class="content">It may not be here, but if and when it arrives, I'll want one.<br><br>I'll never want an iPad in its current incarnation.<br><br>So I'm going to keep tabs on this Courier device, but not on a must-do list, it can drop off my DWM list.</div>

<div class="content">Somehow that reminds me of this video: <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRH8eimU_20" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRH8eimU_20</a><br>That's more than 20 years old, and we're still not there yet.</div>

<div class="content">Alex W. - Thanks for posting that!   Even with all that technology, he still couldn't get his lectures prepared on time...  :-)</div>
