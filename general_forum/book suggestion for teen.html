<div class="content">I am interested in finding a book/gift for a relative, boy, age 13.<br>Seemed something that was appropriate for his age and covered much of what is on this site would be most useful. Goal, project, dream, life plan setting. Use of calendar, lists. Actually getting it all done. This is my bias, as something I WISH someone had taught me from that age. And maybe his parents have this covered - I don't know him very well. But I assume, even if already organized, there must be always be something to learn. I'd rather give this, compared to short term excitement:  Xbox or PlayStation.<br><br>Any ideas? thank you</div>

<div class="content">Ohh... tricky. Teens can be finicky with this stuff. However, if you the teen in question is interested in productivity, goal setting, etc, Sean Covey (son of the late Dr. Stephen Covey) is a safe bet:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sean-Covey/e/B001H6MUA4/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Sean-Covey/e/B001H6MUA4/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1</a></div>

<div class="content">You could add a voucher "upgrade" to it: once he has read more than 2/3 of the book, you will buy him the productivity app for his smartphone or whatver device he has, that he wants.<br><br>Remember: old age and treachery beats youth and finickiness every time.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe we need a good fictional hero that uses FVP to accomplish great deeds. :-) Or 5T. Or at least "little and often"! :-)<br><br>Or maybe one of Mark's books can find itself appearing in a work of fiction, kind of like <<Way of a Pilgrim>> shows up in JD Salinger's <<Franny and Zooey>>.  :-)<br><br>Maybe AndreasE can work it into his next book! :-) :-) :-)<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Carpet-Makers-Andreas-Eschbach/dp/0765314908" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/The-Carpet-Makers-Andreas-Eschbach/dp/0765314908</a></div>

<div class="content">It's hard (I imagine) to combine the romance and excitement that teenagers crave with advice on productivity and time management. Action dramas are a movie genre, time-management dramas aren't. <br><br>I once played some sort of space battle game with my family that involved us all linking our phones (as we sat in the same room) and when the right cues came up on screen, having to yell various commands while obeying the commands that were coming to us. It was complete chaos and a lot of fun. <br><br>Among the various required actions like "Raise the force shields!" "Prepare to repel boarders!" "Engage hyperdrive!" and so on, there were actions like "Update your agenda!" and "Plan tonight's dinner menu!" <br><br>But I think those were intended ironically.<br><br>I'm afraid that's really unhelpful, MatthewS, sorry.<br><br>There ought to be some way of educating teenagers to think sensibly about their pension plans too, but it would take a genius teacher to do it.</div>

<div class="content">I'd wager that parent(s) who conduct themselves (at work and home) in a manner that is principled- centred, and embody habits that support said principles, will not have to worry about time management issues for their children.</div>

<div class="content">Are there books to help parents instil good time-management practices?</div>

<div class="content">oh this is ironic funny. < something I WISH someone had taught me from that age > I've not followed up until now on all the replies, because, well, I still continually seek to be more organized. anyway, a belated THANK YOU. OK, more specifically. Do like idea, but I'm not close enough to person for the voucher/smartphone idea. The Sean Covey book could be interesting, I'd want to read it myself. Honestly, never was a fan of Stephen Covey. For me, he was too many pages of just dense reading text, and too little on idea. As for parents and how the behave! Yeah, that is likely it. I'm not the parent, but I do know the way I am is directly from my parents. And .... OH! AHA!, I'm not super close to these parents, however, I know the grandparents and they are very organized, so maybe this is dumb and the teen has it fine.<br><br>More about the idea. This started for me, when I thought, why give rice cooker or towel or money towards trip for marriage gift? So many end in divorce. Why not give book on how to be a better couple/relationship?<br><br>And in the case of the teen, same idea, instead of tennis racquet or $100 for Bar Mitzvah, which is all about become a man and such. why not give a gift that is valuable for life, instead of just an instant.<br><br>Anyway, thanks again for answers. And maybe this proves there is a need for this book to be written.</div>

<div class="content">I once saw the following in a magazine for young children. And even this simple idea amazed me.<br>Get a piece of paper and pencil. Spread your fingers and trace around them, so that shows all 5 fingers and hand outline. Now, you can label each finger with the weekdays (days at school). And begin to make a simple schedule. Monday you learn of book report. So read book that night. Tuesday make an outline. Wednesday write the report. Thursday 2nd and final edit of report. Friday turn in book report. What I might have done? Start book report Friday morning while waiting for the school bus.</div>
