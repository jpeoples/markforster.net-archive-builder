<div class="content">I am a bit confused on where to start with AF. From Mark's blog posts I have seen various versions (like AF2/3/4), but I'm not sure which one to actually start with.<br><br>Is the newer one (AF4) better than the others? Or, should I just start with AF1 until AF4 and see what works? <br><br>Your thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">Whichever you choose. Give it time and try to follow the rules as closely as possible. If you try to remake AF into what you want it to be, you will probably just end up with a to-do list.<br><br>After some time and practice with any of the systems you can easily take the skills learned (allowing items to stand out) to other versions. <br><br>Not that it matters much to you, but I practiced AF1 for some time then AF2 and found that depending on my situation I use one or the other. It is pretty clear to me when each is more appropriate.<br><br>Give yourself some time and use some diligence.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">You could try DWM which Mark came up with after AF4.<br><br>There is a summary here: <a href="http://u.nu/8rcr8" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://u.nu/8rcr8</a></div>
