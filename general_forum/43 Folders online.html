<div class="content">Does anyone know of a web-based implementation of 43 Folders?  A site where I could enter tasks into the 'folders' and maybe be emailed when things become due?<br><br>I'm looking into using it as a tickler system.  What I'm currently doing with some tickler-ish things is entering them into Google Calendar (with email reminder). I'm wondering whether I would be better off using 43 folders.</div>

<div class="content">Try Toodledo (toodledo.com). There you can make folders and name them 01, 02, ... , and 01_Jan, 02_Feb, etc. You can add tasks to those folders.</div>

<div class="content">There are a number of possible options. It seems that everyone is trying to build a better to do  list / tickler file and running after the lucrative iPhone app money.<br><br>Google around. I would start with a search like:<br><br>"remember the milk" alternatives<br><br>Your needs, devices, and how complex you want to get will inform your choice.<br><br>I have a huge shelving unit that has 45 cubes. I use it as a physical and visible tickler file / calendar. Electronic solutions never work as well for me, out of sight, out of mind (in a bad way).</div>

<div class="content">Remember the Milk is a good suggestion. You can set to have reminders sent to you via email, SMS, or Twitter.</div>

<div class="content">I think GooToDo does what you want.  <a href="http://goodtodo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://goodtodo.com/</a><br><br>I haven't used it, but Mel uses it and it sounds like it will do exactly what you want.</div>
