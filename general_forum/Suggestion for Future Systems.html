<div class="content">Hello Mark and board,<br>I have enjoyed and made great use of DIT, and to a lesser extent AF.  One of the core items that I believe can be improved is the "little and often" approach, which is helpful in getting some monumental tasks done (filing, paying bills, organizing a bookcase, etc) falls short when it comes to larger problems such as learning and large projects.  While both projects and learning can be broken down into subtasks and worked on, "little and often" does not apply well to these items.  Just a thought, TK</div>

<div class="content">Hi TK<br>Easy solution......just create large timeblocks or set up your calendar so that you have large blocks of time to dedicate to your endeavor.  If I'm lucky enough to be in a great flow, I'll even push aside the mundane stuff until the streak runs out.  The trick is to stay current/slightly ahead so that you can do this.  Also, sometimes I'll intentionally do the mundane stuff ahead of schedule with the purpose of freeing up future time.  That way I can devote all of me to the project or learning/discovery session without any worries to distract a part of my mind.  I always create/produce/learn/discover better with a free mind.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi TK<br><br>I am surprised you find "little and often" a weakness of AF. <br><br>Firstly, it is only an aspect of the more important principle: "Work on an item for as long as you feel like doing so".   This more important principle would surely help you to overcome any shortcoming you see in "little and often".<br><br>Secondly I am surprised by the tasks you regard as "monumental" (filing, paying bills and organizing a bookcase).  However, I guess your point is that if you do not do them often enough, they might become monumental.<br><br>Thirdly, I find myself resisting your suggestion that large projects and learning do not respond well to "little and often".  I can agree that some projects might be best handled by starting them and not letting up for anything until they are finished, but I feel that most projects benefit from: an early start, persistent attention and timely conclusion well ahead of deadline.  As for learning, there seems to be an even stronger case for spaced practice of what is to be learned (recall Mark's often repeated examples of learning a language or learning a musical instrument).<br><br>Finally, if one finds a problem with "little and often", the solution is simple:  "Work on a task as often and as long as it seems to you to be likely to produce the best results." <br>Do you think that formulation would overcome the problems you have with "little and often?"</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I do a weekly hybrid version of DIT.  Most of the regular stuff is batched via checklists and ritualized habits.  It gives me great control over the predictable stuff.  AF was too random for me but I'm sure with AF that you can still give yourself large blocks of time to devote yourself to your endeavors without unnecessary distractions. I agree with you.  When it's practical, working to completion is easier for me to manage vs little and often on a list built organically (randomly placed vs  timebound objectives and categories).  I respect that the AF users prefer the AF methodology. What hinders me helps them!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi TK,<br><br>I agree with Learning on this one.  Block time for some things.  Learning is a good example of something that you can use both approahes for.  Take learning a language for example.  It usually breaks down into things that take longer sessions and things that can be done little and often.  When you are learning the rules of grammer, for example conjugating a family of verbs ... it is probably best to study the rules for a block of time and work it thorugh without distraction.  But then when you are learning vocabularly, you can benefit from setting short timers during the day and working for 10-30 minutes bursts.<br><br>The large blocks also benefit from short review periods that you can squeeze in anywhere and do in short bursts.<br><br> The same approach could be taken with learning most things.  Spend a block of two hours or so reading the material and learning the principles, then use short bursts for review, memorizing key formulas, dates, vocabulary or general review.<br><br>As to other things you suggest (like paying bills or filing) I find they yield best to routine.  Pay bills on Saturday morning every week.  File papers on Tuesday while your favorite TV show is on.  That kind of thing.  (Or, with filing, you could just file every paper when you are done with it ;-)</div>

<div class="content">The Autofocus instructions state:<br><br>"Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so<br><br>Don’t force yourself to continue working on the item for longer than you feel right doing so. This system encourages a “little and often” approach. Once you feel you’ve done enough, stop." <br><br>Wouldn't it be better for the first line to say:<br><br>"Work on that item for as /little/ as you feel like doing so" ???<br><br>Often only the first line gets quoted, and rarely the accompanying explanation.</div>

<div class="content">Hi All;<br>I've been utilizing time blocking and that works well--I'm going to work on studying French for 2 hrs or whatnot.  So problem solved there, my point was more that as a "system" little and often doesn't handle such tasks well.  If you just learned French for as long as you feel like it or spend 10 min here then come back to it a half day later it seems like you are seriously interrupting your learning.  Maybe this is more a philosophical tension than a systems tension, but something I thought I'd point out.  <br>As for what little and often does well, when I mentioned bill paying and whatever I was referring more to an imagined backlog of tasks or big piles of paperwork built up.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I'm learning German, Spanish and Portuguese at the moment and I find the 'little and often' approach works beautifully. Remember that 'little' is a relative term here. It doesn't mean never work for more than 5 or 10 minutes at a stretch on anything. It means that regular work on a project is more effective than one huge burst of activity (usually at the last minute). <br><br>Regarding "working for as long as you feel like it", if you are so demotivated at learning German that you would never feel like working at it for more than 10 minutes then frankly you'd be better off doing something else.<br><br>The trouble with time blocking is that "Work for 2 hours on French" may be fine some days, but on others nothing will get you to start. Once you fail to do your stint one day, then it becomes more likely that you will fail the next and so on.<br><br>There is much less resistance attached to "Work on French for as long as I feel like it".</div>

<div class="content">Mark ,<br><br>What kind of system works for you to learn a new language?  I  am looking for this answer myself to help me improve. So far, I need to listen and repeat much more than modern methods offer. But I never learnt only by studying the structure of a language as a friend of mine does.<br><br>Aguardo sua sugestão!</div>

<div class="content">Silvia<br><br>I find the Pimsleur Method very good, though expensive. I believe they have courses for learning English for native speakers of several other languages, but I don't know if Portuguese is one of them. If you want to learn a language other than English, then your spoken English needs to be quite good as they use English as the base language.<br><br>My recommendation would be to learn with Pimsleur alone for as far as the course will take you, then switch to a grammar-based course. The grammar will come much more easily if you have some fluency in the spoken language.</div>

<div class="content">Norman:<br><br>Not sure that works. My best language is French (I'm a qualified French interpreter - though very rusty these days), but I've never lived in a French-speaking country. My second best language is Spanish, but I've never lived in a Spanish-speaking country.  I've lived in Germany for more than five years but my German is terrible. I've also lived in an Arabic-speaking country for over a year, and my Arabic consists of no more than a few words.<br><br>If you have to use the language the whole time, even at home, then yes... but just living in the country doesn't achieve much. And if you're going to use the language at work, then you need to know it to a very high standard before you start.</div>

<div class="content">Pimlseur is great. After getting the basics down of their method, you can apply them to exercises on your own.<br><br>Watching TV, movies, etc. in the language you are learning is great with subtitles or not. Understanding is not the point but becoming more familiar with sounds and structure. You will soak things up.<br><br>Also, with internet streaming you can extend this practice to listening to radio programs in the language you are trying to learn. DW does a remarkable job at this.<br><br>Finding a group of people who meet up to speak the language you are learning is a great way to improve your skills as well. There are usually native as well second language speakers. It is a great way to get over embarrassment of speaking the language.<br><br>For pronunciation of the language (my greatest difficulty), it has been shown that attempting to use the foreign pronunciation in your own tongue can help develop pronunciation skills when you don't have the opportunity to speak the target language.<br><br>Read, read, read. It builds up passive vocabulary and develops mastery of more complicated grammatical structures. Don't pick up that dictionary for every word you don't know or that grammar for every confusing syntactical structure. Just read for as much understanding as you can get out of it.<br><br>FWIW.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Let me add a caveat. Don't speak your native language ever. As English speakers, German speakers I found were eager to practice their rather impeccable English with me. I refused to answer a single question in English and eventually they would indulge my desire to speak only in German.<br><br>I picked up dialect this way as well. Austrians had no desire to speak so called High German and I had no ability to speak the regional dialect (dialect in the truest sense). I just refused to speak English and eventually I picked up a fair amount of dialect. I picked up enough dialect that years later on a tour of the Metropolitan Opera, I surprised a couple dialect speakers by joining in their conversation. A couple German speakers had little idea what we were saying.<br><br>But yes, something propadeutic is helpful before imersing oneself into a language speaking community. I found that six months of basic instruction here in the States was enough for me to sink or swim when I enrolled in University classes taught in German in Germany and Austria.<br><br>Other American students who had taken years of German instruction prior to arriving to University had a leg up, but their persistent use of of English with German speakers and among themselves undercut advancing their language skills.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>What are your thoughts on studying multiple languages at the same time?  I know there are issues of interference ... but those may be more a function of how similar the languages are.  OTOH, I can see some benefit to learning "close" languages as the similarities might help.<br><br>Have you had experience with the Rosetta Stone product?<br><br>Norman,<br><br>Yeah, I had a colleague from Taiwan who was very bright yet could not speak without a serious accent and could not master even rudimentary grammar ... especially the use of pronouns and articles which seemed to bedevil her.  Her problem was, I believe, that as soon as she got home she spoke only Mandarin.  In her mind she was not really committed to speaking English, I guess.  To her English was still a "foreign language", and so she could not master it.</div>

<div class="content">Norman:<br><br>Lots of good points there, Norman. Especially about refusing to speak your own language. Easier said than done of course, and it requires a lot of will-power. In France, if someone speaks to me in English I translate what they've just said back into French - they usually get the message!<br><br>Even with a language that I know very little of, e.g. Turkish, I try to say everything that I can say in Turkish in that language. It may only be a few words, but it makes a heck of a difference.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Please don't regard me as an expert on learning languages. I don't speak any foreign (to me) language except French well enough to sustain a serious conversation in it.<br><br>However with that proviso, I don't find learning multiple languages using Pimsleur as much of a problem, even though the scenarios are similar in each lesson. Even with two very similar languages like Spanish and Portuguese, I find I get into the frame of mind for the right language without a problem. <br><br>I tried Rosetta Stone with German and my feeling is that it is nothing like as effective as Pimsleur. Retention of what one has learned is much poorer, and although Pimsleur is not grammar based it does give you explanations about what is going on when necessary. You're not just left to flounder on your own. Also Pimsleur takes much more trouble to adapt the lessons to the nature of the individual language and culture. <br><br>The only problem with Pimsleur is that it makes you sound so fluent that people think you can speak the language much better than you actually can!</div>

<div class="content">Pimsluer is good in learning how to pronounce words. Their method of working "backwards" through the pronunciation is brilliant and very effective. There is not enough instruction for gaining a large active vocabulary IMHO or passive for that matter.<br><br>For more work on pronunciation, in German at least:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pronounce-Perfectly-German/dp/0812080343" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Pronounce-Perfectly-German/dp/0812080343</a><br><br>Simply repeating words over and over with emphasis on learning to be able to pronounce as well as possible sounds that do not occur in English. Not the most riveting of exercises, but helpful. Just listening is helpful as well.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-05-29 16:01</div>
<div class="content">Norman:<br><br>The backwards method is mainly used in the early lessons. And pronunciation is about a whole lot more than just being able to say words correctly. It is excellent at teaching you the rhythm and flow of the language, and how to respond quickly too.<br><br>It's quite possible to have an enormous vocabulary and still have difficulty conversing. Pimsleur aims to teach you the most common conversational words, so that you have the basic structure with which to expand your knowledge.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-29 20:59</div>
<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>I agree about the importance of learning to pronounce correctly.  I've found that learning to hear correctly comes first.  I've used the Audio Forum course which is pretty much just lifted from the FSI course (Foreign Service Institute) which, IIRC, was done by the U.S. State Department and/or the U.S. Army language training courses.<br><br>In the early lessons they focus on the very subtle differences between English and the other language.  In Spanish, for example, they make a big deal about the differences in pronunciation of "t" and "d" (as in Como Esta).  They provide exercises to learn to hear and get the accent right.  It seems to be a good approach ... at least in that respect.</div>

<div class="content">I agree that finding a boyfriend/girlfriend with whom you converse only in the foreign language is the best way to learn.  My French was never as good as when I had a francophone girlfriend.  Now, though I live in France, it is with my English wife and family.  Being married is very good (at least in my case), but a bi-product is that my French has suffered!</div>
