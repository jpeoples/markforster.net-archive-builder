<div class="content">Starting tomorrow, I will begin (or end) each day by<br><br>1. creating a new page in GoodNotes 5 (Note-taking app for iPad)<br>2. review my calendar appointments<br>3. Re-write each appointment onto the new "daily" page in GoodNotes<br><br>Throughout the day, I will add a brief entry before/after an activity or event. Each entry will have the time of day, location and with whom I am with. The entries will primarily be based on facts (what, where, who, how). If there is a task, or something that needs to be remembered, I will highlight the passage. If the entry is related to a project, it will be "tagged" with the project name. <br><br>At the end of the week, I will create a narrative based on the daily entries. The narrative will also consist of facts, highs/lows of the past week.<br><br>Photo of a typical daily entry: https://ibb.co/qkXWw3J</div>

<div class="content">That is cool Avrum. I've just been revisiting my Adroit pencil. It did not work with the screen saver on my iPad. Took off the plastic so I will see if it works with Good notes.</div>

<div class="content">No interest in the pencils, but this Narrative thing seems interesting to me.  What's your theory about what it will do for you, Avrum?</div>

<div class="content">Alan<br><br><<What's your theory about what it will do for you, Avrum?>><br><br>I've been using a variation of this method for appx 2 or 3 years. At this point, it's less theory, and more expected results. <br><br>The idea first occurred to me after reading Danny Gregory's The Creative License: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1401307922/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_tArGCb7H9Z6MR<br><br>He encouraged readers to keep sketches, thoughts, to-do's, project information etc in the same journal. That "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts". The traditional way - keeping tasks/projects, notes, sketches in different areas - loses the beauty and meaning of one's life. I found this to be true. <br><br>Also, another idea that informed my system was the late S. Covey's suggestion to "Sharpen the Mental Saw" by journaling. <br><br>Finally, Barbara Sher's "Emotional Touchstones" - the emotional, juicy center of what you want or  need out of any encounter, goal or project - highlighted my need and joy to create a system that focuses on self-growth and nostalgia (Where I've been...). <br><br>But even more importantly, at the end of the year, I create an annual narrative based on the monthly narratives. To date, I have two annual narratives - 2017 & 2018 - and they are a joy (mixed with some sadness and anxiety) to read. <br><br>Thanks for asking the question, Alan.</div>

<div class="content">Currently I have a daily log I'm keeping in Excel.  One column is a reflection on the day (can be a paragraph), and one column is a looking ahead to the next day.  I also track a few numbers that maybe sometimes I'll analyse.<br><br>I'm not sure if that start would be a basis for achieving what you've got going.</div>

I do Serial No-List as normal -- no changes to the rules at all. But I use the same notebook for meeting minutes, brainstorms, doodles, whatever. I just start a new page, or just draw a heavy line across a older page that's mostly empty, and capture stuff there. It's great having it all in one place, and actually seems to enhance Serial No-List. <br><br>The only problem is I find myself burning through this notebook really fast!  I will probably need to start using a thicker notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, Seraphim:<br><br>I used a very similar method when I was in Australia - one notebook in which everything went. The only rule was that I'd always rule a line when I started something new or went back to something old - and date it. One thing I've learned over the years is *always* to include the year when I date something.<br><br>When at home I normally use a ruled Moleskine with a stiff cover, but when away I prefer a blank page Moleskine with a soft cover. Perhaps it has more of a holiday feel.</div>
