<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">For those with time on their hands (should be all of us, right?), there's an interesting thread about AutoFocus over at the OmniFocus forum.<br><br><a href="http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=11373&highlight=autofocus" rel="nofollow">http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=11373&highlight=autofocus</a><br><br>Here's a quote from one  of the posters  there:<br><br>"I am deeply impressed by the AutoFocus method. The admin of this forum should merciless kill all entries discussing it: This method has the capacity to put all developers of time management software out of business. AF might very well be the next GTD – only that it won't create much business, because all you need is a cheap notebook, a calendar and a pencil, read 8 rules and 10 minutes later you're up and running."</div>

<div class="content">Ah, well. If Mark would kill all entries discussing AutoFocus, there wouldn't be much left, would there?<br><br>Perhaps we are still too addicted to fiddling with our systems. Perhaps it will settle down after a while. Perhaps not. ;-)</div>
