<div class="content">I am thinking of trying AF again in Outlook 2007.  Previously, I setup things by start date as a category.  Does anyone have a better way to do this in Outlook 2007?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">As I (and others) have mentioned here before, I think the best way to display tasks in Outlook (I don't have 2007, only 2003, but it should be similar) for AF would be to group by creation date. In the long run, this will probably come close to the separation into pages (the number of newly created and done tasks per day should be equal in the long run), and it saves you having to create different folders, add categories or such. You can easily expand the relevant batch and collapse all others.<br><br>I would save the start date for real start dates and, likewise, the due date for "hard" due dates. This enables you to create additional views that Entering start/due dates is pretty quick, unlike adding categories. <br><br>Being able to create different views is one of the major benefits of a digital solution, IMHO. <br>And Outlook is - save for the lack of hierarchical tasks - probably the most flexible program when it comes to filtering, grouping and sorting.<br><br>Yet, I'm still trying to get AF working on paper, mainly because I don't want an Outlook-only (or Windows-only) solution.<br><br>-- <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, the second paragraph should read: <br><br>I would save the start date for real start dates and, likewise, the due date for "hard" due dates. This enables you to create additional views for regular checks that you don't miss any of those (or to schedule some time for larger tasks etc.). <br>Entering start/due dates is pretty quick, unlike adding categories.</div>

<div class="content">How do your group by creation date?  I take it you do not mean use the creation date as a category.  I can see how to sort by creation date, but that does not make distinct pages per se.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">It's been a while since I've used Outlook so not sure if this will work or not...<br><br>Maybe you could create categories for a certain number of tasks (say 35) - Page 1, Page 2, Page 3<br><br>Set up 2 filters (or views, not sure what they're called)<br><br>Filter #1: Tasks with no category (not sure if Outlook lets you filter for no categories with "page" - that would be preferable because it would allow you to add other categories to your new items). -This is where you add new items, once you get to your limit (eg 35), you select all items and create a new "Page X" category. This list should now be empty.<br><br>Filter #2: All categories with Page in the title ordered by creation date (add this as a field to your display) - then use a special coloured flag to indicate your place.</div>

<div class="content">About sorting by creation date, you can get it to display as a column header by right clicking on your column header (ie where it says Subject, Categories, due Date etc) - you should see something called Field Chooser, select this. You should see in the drop down list "Date/Time Fields", select this. Then you should have a field called "Created" - this is your creation date field. Drag this where you want it in your column headers.<br><br>Hope that makes sense!</div>

<div class="content">Just checked Outlook 2007 - you should be able to set up the filters I suggested. <br><br>If you go to View>Current View>Define View. Then choose "New" - name your view, keep it on "Table" (default), click okay - it will give you some options to create filtered views.<br><br>To create a filter to see categories with "page" in it:<br>Click Filter, Click Advanced. Click Field, Choose "frequently used fields", click Categories. Choose "contains" (default) and enter "page" into the blank field.<br><br>To create a filter to see tasks with no "page" category attached to it:<br>Click Filter, Click Advanced. Click Field, Choose "frequently used fields", click Categories. Choose "doesn't contain" (default) and enter "page" into the blank field.<br><br>You probably should also add the creation date field to these views and have it sorted by it. Back in the customisation options for your view (you should be returned to this after setting up the filter but if not, you can get to it later by going to View>Current View>Define View - select the view you want and click modify).<br><br>Add a creation date to your view.<br>Click on Fields. You should see in the drop down list "Date/Time Fields", select this. Then you should have a field called "Created" - this is your creation date field. Select it and click on "Add->" to add it to your list of fields. You can drag it up and down in the list to change the order.<br><br>Automatically sort by creation date (if you do this then you don't need to group by Pages)<br>Click on Sort. At the bottom of the popup, you'll see a drop-down "Select available fields from" - choose the "Date/Time Fields". Back at the top of the popup, you should now be able to select "Created" for "Sort Items By". I think it's "Ascending" to sort them with the oldest showing first</div>

<div class="content">Grouping and Filtering are very different from sorting. <br>It's all about defining "views", which you can only access indirectly.<br><br>Sorry, I can't explain that better at the moment, because (a) I only have Outlook 2003, not 2007, even though that functionality has been basically unchanged since Outlook 97, so it's probably still there in 2007, (b) I have a German version where everything is named differently - which sucks more than I can say - and (c) it's way past midnight here, so I haven't got any energy left to come up with a better explanation. <br><br>I'll try to sort that out until tomorrow - in fact: later today - and put it into another post.<br><br>-- <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Alex, I get confused with Outlook terminology even when I'm not rusty!<br><br>When I said "Set up 2 filters (or views, not sure what they're called)" in my first post in this thread, I think what I ended up describing was setting up 2 separate views each with its own filter.</div>

<div class="content">After looking more at this, the only way I can find to make this work is to create categories called pages -- Page 1, Page 2, etc.  Then when I have a new task, I can assign it to the most recent page that is not filled.  I can sort by creation date and therefore new tasks will always be at the end of the list.  I don't see an easy way to determine how many tasks I have on a page besided manually counting.  <br><br>Any advice?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, just a suggestion as we talked extensively about OneNote.  How about using OneNote just to set up your pages (takes about 3-4 minutes to type out a page), and then transferring open items to Outlook Task Manager with the category of the the relevant page number?  That would keep each page as a closed list.  The way you mention above would effectively have open lists as you would be adding new items to replace cleared ones on a page and would result in you being left with the high resistance items.</div>

<div class="content">I am using Michael Linenberger’s Total Workday Control setup within Outlook's To-Do list.  I find value in the concept of prioritizing truly high priority tasks, “aging” out tasks naturally, future dating tasks so they appear when actionable and allowing the automation in Outlook handle recurring tasks.  To incorporate AF into that, I did two things:<br><br>1)  I added a number next to all tasks.  E.g. 1-Read MF forums.<br>2)  After 35 tasks, I enter a new task called "-----PAGE BREAK-----".<br><br>This allows me to then print off the pages using the “Only selected rows” option.  It works quite well, I get the benefit of the closed list while retaining the significant benefits of Outlook and automation.<br><br>--K<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine B,<br><br>I am not sure what you mean by transferring items from OneNote to Outlook.  I know one can create Outlook tasks from OneNote.  Is this what you meant?  Or do you mean physically cutting and pasting from one to the other?  If the latter, this seems to be a lot of extra overhead.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David, the second view with the filter set up the way I described would filter out all tasks that were already allocated to a page - so you only need click on this view and add more tasks, you don't need to allocate a new page category for each new task which would be tedious (and shouldn't otherwise it would filter it out).<br><br>I just started up Outlook and I think there's a much easier solution to manually counting. If you are using the same sized monitor and keep Outlook in full screen then you will have the same number of lines that are visible at any one time (for my monitor, I counted 38 which is similar to an A4 notebook). With your second view (the one that only shows tasks that don't have a page allocated to them or whatever more complicated filter you might set up so that you are effectively seeing the last page of AF), all you need do is enter tasks until you come to the end of the Outlook "page" (ie when you add any more tasks, the window starts scrolling) at which point you select all tasks and allocated them to a new page category. Voila, you should now have a fresh clean page.<br><br>I was thinking that for the first view, you don't actually need to set it up so that you're only seeing tasks with a page allocated (unless of course you put in tasks into Outlook that are not part of Outlook but then you'd need more advanced filters anyway) - the first view just needs to be all your tasks but with the page categories showing (so you can track your progress and know when to dismiss) and sorted by creation date. <br><br>It would be a little work setting up the two views in the first place but afterwards, it would be quite simple to use.<br><br>Please let me know if any of these instructions need clarifying.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using Outlook 2003, sorting by start date, and printing out the whole list once a week, which gives me the standard length pages. <br><br>During the week I'm currently adding all new tasks twice - once into Outlook and once onto my printout, so both ways are always up-to-date. Not ideal, but when I got snowed in today and had to work from home I was glad my list wasn't sitting in a notebook in my office! I'll probably work out the best way soon and either go all-digital or all-paper.<br><br>Anyway, one niggling little thing... Although I sort by start date in ascending order (so tasks added at later dates appear further down the list), the individual tasks always appear at the top of that particular date's tasks rather than the bottom! Anyone know how to fix this? Ideally I want to sort by date AND time I guess but I can't find an option for it.<br><br>Any pointers gratefully received!<br><br>Kirsty</div>

<div class="content">I'm sorting by creation date and typing "EOP" after each page.<br>With a format set to make "EOP" really noticable (Large, Green, Old English Font)<br>Clicking at the title of the sort field usually reverses the order, Kirsty.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">This approach works nicely for me: I only ever need to type the task itself: no dates or other flags. I use the default category for a one click "dot" on the current task and I can filter out the completed tasks so each page gets shorter and shorter.<br><br>But...<br><br>Is there any way to transfer the creation time to a Windows Mobile device? In the native tasks application and in Pcket Informant, I can't see how to get at it.<br><br>So for now, my method only works on the big screen.<br><br>Thank heavens for wireless!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">While start dates do not have specific times, the creation date has a time attached. So if you use start dates (and you always set them to "today"), you can group by them, and in addition sort by creation date, so the order of the items under one 'page' (= one group) will always stay the same.<br><br>IMO, grouping (or a combination of grouping and sorting) is better than simple sorting. You don't need dummy 'page break' tasks, and you can expand one 'page' only, while collapsing all the others. This gives you a better 'closed list' effect.<br><br>Grouping can be accessed by a right click on the headers of the task view, choosing something like "define current view" (unfortunately, I don't know how exactly it's called in an English version of Outlook, I have a German version of OL 2003) at the end of the context menu, and then using the 'group' button. The same goes for sorting. The sort order will only work inside of the groups. Creation date will only be accessible when you set it to show all date/time fields. And while you're at it, you can filter out done items.<br><br>OTOH, this also shows that the solution I proposed earlier does *not* work, unfortunately. Outlook builds a group for every creation date *and* for every creation time. So you'll end up having lots of groups of single items.</div>

<div class="content">Grouping is great, and you can get Outlook to group by page. I haven't been using the system long, but I'm assigning my tasks a page number under Categories - just "1", "2" etc - and then sorting the whole task list by Categories as the primary sort function. (If Categories isn't already a sortable field in Tasks, you can add it by right-clicking on the title bar and selecting Field Chooser.)  Using groups as Alex W describes, and sorting by category, Outlook can automatically group your tasks by "page", rather than date, without any extra break lines.<br><br>Also, Outlook (2003 in my case too) tells you how many tasks are in each group, so it's easy to keep your pages separate. This works on my (rather antiquated) PDA too, as I can get it to display just the active tasks on a particular page number.<br><br>I do have Outlook 2007 at home though, so would be really interested to find out more about integrating the list with  OneNote.</div>

<div class="content">I have been creating folders which I call Screen 01, Screen 02 etc. A screen is what I can view without scrolling down. As I work on an item I move it on to the last page (Screen) if not finished. A screen can therefore have e-mails with a whole range of initial dates, just as a paper AF list would. Once a screen is empty I delete it or rename it to become the most recent screen, if required. <br><br>Nelson e-mail Organiser used in conjunction with Outlook facilitates management of e-mails, categorising, finding etc.</div>

<div class="content">I am very comfortable using creation date/ time on the PC with a simple dummy task at the end of each day. This works well for me on the laptop. (the dummy task is four keystrokes every day or so)<br><br>My problem is when I am away from the laptop, as there seems to be no way to access the creation timestamp on the smartphone.<br><br>I am reluctant to do any more data entry than I need to. Which means just entering the task description. Is there a way to set up Outlook to automatically set the start date to the creation date?</div>

<div class="content">And the answer is...<br><br>Group by start date.<br><br>Add new tasks with no start date (just type the thought or drag in a mail).<br><br>When I get a screenfull, I set the start date of all the current tasks to "today". (set the first one, drag and drop the rest together). This is a tiny overhead but does give me "pages" which transfer to my smartphone.<br><br>I do not use the task end dates, of course (that would not be very AF, would it?!) so I disable the "overdue" formatting. This is important, as the end date defaults to the start date, so I have a LOT of "overdue" tasks.</div>
