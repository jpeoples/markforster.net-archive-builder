<div class="content">1. Find out what is to be done.<br>2. Work on it.<br><br>I see AutoFocus as a great tool to help step 1.  But if my house is burning down, I don't grab my AF list, add Get Out to the list, and then scan through my list looking for a Get Out task (pausing to feed the cat first, since its on my list). :-)<br><br>I don't because I already know what is to be done, and AF doesn't add to the chore.  If I'm busy all day in meetings, I don't need AF to tell me I'm busy in meetings.  It goes without saying.  What it can do is (1) record things for later doing, and (2) keep me productive in-between meetings.<br><br>So that's it: AF helps me know what I need to do.  If something comes up which is not on the current section of the list, I don't fret because Rules 1 and 2 trump all other systems.<br><br>It seems to me the "bookmark list" is a good idea, because that bookmark list is heavily focused on critical stuff, and can be a real aid to actually achieving the Rules.</div>

<div class="content">Systems such as Autofocus and Getting Things Done, as well as others, are intended to provide a way to deal with discretionary time.<br><br>I wouldn't record the fact that since my house is burning down, I should get out in my discretionary time!</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster has said from the beginning that if something needs to be done now- do it (whether it is on your list or not). That applies to all of the autofocus systems.</div>

<div class="content">That's true Mark T., but it's backwards.  The right way to look at it is to first admit that your system is merely a system, and not in charge.  You are in charge, and you may do what you need or want to do whether or not the system tells you.  <br><br>The system is evaluated by this standard: to the extent following it makes your life work better, it is a good system.  If the strict adherence creates a problem, maybe it's still a good system but the strictness was inappropriate.  <br><br>Back to the principles: Find out what needs doing.  <br><br>If AF (or GTD or Franklin-Covey or ...) tells you what needs doing, follow AF.  If while following AF something else tells you what needs doing, follow that.  This doesn't mean you've abandoned AF, and it doesn't mean AF has failed.  As long as the system is still helpful towards Rule 1, it's still worth it.</div>

<div class="content">I basically agree, but I guess it also depends on how you interpret the word "need". I often use my AF list just as an old todo list (because I am a father of two small kids I don't have much free time in large chunks.) The small tricks like marking with a dot each ongoing task etc are helpful. Anyway... Sometimes I succeed in forcing myself to at least only do things that is on the list, not doing all those "needs" that constantly pops up in my head ("Hey, it would be nice to play a game of XYZ now", "Hey, it was a long time since I visited that fun web site"). So, my point is that if I did everything I "need" to do, not much important would be done :), and "AF" helps me control that a bit.</div>

<div class="content">That's exactly what I mean.  You must choose what to do.  If AF helps you make better choices, then it's working.</div>
