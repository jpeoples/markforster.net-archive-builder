<div class="content">Thanks, Jacqueline!  The article on procrastination tapped into something that I've been feeling lately.  I'm getting more done, but it's not the important stuff.<br><br>This line resonated with me:<br><br>"Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work."<br><br>I've been avoiding the real work by filling my time with errands.  Admittedly, this is a step up from avoiding real work AND errands by filling time with internet surfing...  but I want to change the balance.<br></div>

<div class="content">I know what you mean Kathy - I really like my "A-book" as the solution to this for me.  OTOH, radical dismissal of 75% or more of the errands would probably work as well.<br><br>Mike, hope you see this - here's an article for you on Shiny New Thing Syndrome:<br><br><a href="http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/6739/Entrepreneurs-and-Hey-There-s-A-Shiny-New-Thing.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/6739/Entrepreneurs-and-Hey-There-s-A-Shiny-New-Thing.aspx</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>WOW!  More than just the aticle, the comments are fascinating.  Damn, I forgot just how wacked Objectivists can be ... not the philosophy, but the personalities who come out of the woodwork to hold forth on condemning a person because their dead hero hated him.  How awful to live a life where everything is judged by a black and white standard with no contextual references allowed.  Very interesting, but now I need a shower ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Oh good Mike, I hoped you would read it.  I came to reading Branden through Objectivism.

I feel sorry for them.<br><br>What I took away from it as relates to time management etc. though - was that it's completely useless and unconstructive for us to beat ourselves up for not achieving what we think we "should", not following rules, etc. and really focus on what we have done right, the times when what we did was working for us.  <br><br>I think we're all fascinated with that hero within every one of us, hence the splash that Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged made years ago, and the enthusiasm for movies like "300" (or my fascination with Spartan culture).<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>>>>  Oh good Mike, I hoped you would read it. I came to reading Branden through Objectivism. (fyi - a more middle of the road Objectivist site is www.objectivistliving.com - good stuff). Pure objectivism made me too judgmental and too dogmatic, like it obviously has others. I feel sorry for them.  <<<<br><br>Yes, there is something about the philosophy that brings out the worst in some people.  Or maybe it is more that Rand herself was damaged goods.  The idea of moral absolutes is seductive.  And the problem is not even in the idea of moral absolutes, but that people are perfect, have complete and unbiased information, and judging others is a valid way to live one's life.<br><br>>>>  What I took away from it as relates to time management etc. though - was that it's completely useless and unconstructive for us to beat ourselves up for not achieving what we think we "should", not following rules, etc. and really focus on what we have done right, the times when what we did was working for us.  <<<<br><br>Amen to that.<br><br>>>>  I think we're all fascinated with that hero within every one of us, hence the splash that Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged made years ago, and the enthusiasm for movies like "300" (or my fascination with Spartan culture).  <<<<br><br>Actually, the Rand books have a permanent effect on culture.  They are always on the top whatever list of books.  Rand was something of a genius in putting her ideas into fiction, rather than writing a text book.  The downside is that people read the fiction and come away the wrong ideas.  Yes, reality is objective, but people are not.  Right is right and wrong is wrong but context does matter.  That is pretty much what Branden was lamenting.  As a psychologist he was trying to help people yet Objectivists, the religious variety, are bound to condemn.  Objectivism, as envisioned by Ayn Rand, is a more Old Testament kind of thing.<br><br>It is interesting that the people in the Objectivist inner circle who actually DID anything drifted away from it.  Think Branden, Greenspan, etc.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mike & Jacqueline<br><br>I haven't read any of the articles which Jacqueline posted yet though I've marked them up to do so on "Your Reading List", but I went through an Objectivist phase about 20 years ago and read just about everything. In the end I drifted away from it - a long way - I'm now a Catholic!<br><br>I think I just found that there were too many parts of the human experience which it didn't touch - the Objectivists tried to live by reason and had private lives which were anything but run by reason. In the novels there's a very strong misanthropic streak. If you're not a productive member of society then you are a parasite. So who's a productive member of society? A person who writes books and novels about philosophy? A psychologist? Probably not in the eyes of a factory owner. And how does the factory owner appear to the workers in the factory? <br><br>In "Atlas Shrugged" if I remember rightly the whole thing only works at all because the "Atlasses" have discovered a source of energy that is unlimited and free. Yeah, right!</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>That about sums it up.  I honestly don't think that Objectivism is all that bad as a philosophy.  IOW, it tends to break down when the people who read the books try to implement it.  There is nothing inherent in the philosophy that argues against being kind or charitable, for example, but those who I hung with when I was in the movement were harsh and even brutal.  And really proud of it!<br><br>It is a question of personality I believe.  I remember at one Objectivist "party" (now does that idea short circuit something in your brain? ;-) I was talking to a young lady.  She was waxing on about the wonders of Rachmaninoff (one of my favorite composers, as it turns out) and I said something about Gershwin or someone else being a favorite of mine as well.  GAK!  I got a stare that would stop a moving train.  Rachmaninoff was the "sanctioned" Objectivist composer and how could I DARE to like the music of someone else? that look told me.<br><br>As it happened Branden drifted by just then and this young lady tagged him and posed the question "in that voice": "What do you think of the music of George Gershwin?"  Oh boy, did she ever plan for me to get my skin scalded off.  When he said: "Oh, I love his Concerto in F." (or something like that ... it's been so many years and so many parties ago ;-) she looked as if her world came to an end.  She asked how he could like Gershwin when Rachmaninoff was so much "better" and he just shrugged and said something along the lines of "his music makes me smile" or something.  I probably did not see it then, but I'm sure that young lady was already beginning to look for a better movement where her heroes were more absolutist.  Thinking back, I believe that before she drifted to Objectivism she was a member of the John Birch Society.  Figures.<br><br>As to the novel, yes, there is a bit of science fiction there.  I don't mind that in general, but when you are trying to PROVE something with your novel, then having the outcome hinge on something like that is a bit of a "deus ex machina".  I did love Atlas as a novel, though.  I remember the day I read it ... actually it was the night.  I finished the damn thing, cover to cover, in a night.  GAK!  But I did skip over that speech, or rather chapter long tirade ;-)<br><br>I think that there are some very important ideas in the philosophy of Objectivism.  I think that those who are attracted to it as a movement, and who don't have a fully balanced view of the world make it a late night TV joke.  Rand herself was not the best face to put on it.  She had an awful childhood and it warped her into something of a malevolent person.  Her draconian moralism was born of her own pain and she did not see the world as a happy place.  For her, life was noble struggle against the forces of evil.  She would deny it, but that was my observation.  Anyone who was an Objectivist then said: "Yes but ..." was excommunicated.  For her, it had to be all or nothing.  Either you were for her or against her.  I doubt she really cared much which.<br><br>I can hear you say that any philosophy that brings out the worst in people can't be much good.  I've struggled with that idea and have not resolved it yet.  Certainly there are ideas that sound good in theory but fail in practice.  Socialism is one ... Capitalism is another.  Both require that human nature be a certain way in order for them to work in practice.  But human nature is not as required for either of those systems to work, IMO.<br><br>Another feature of Objectivism that causes problems is that it sees human beings as automatons.  Either you are good or bad ... you can't be simply confused, or conflicted, or in doubt or ...  That is why Branden was doomed to be an outcast.  The very idea of an "Objectivist Psychologist" is something of a contradiction in terms.  You can't be in the helping professions and not see people as ... well, human.<br><br>I have to say that my experience with Objectivism was educational.  It did not drive me to Catholicism ;-)  but it did help me understand how living life according to a theory and being shut off from observation of what was "real", leads to error.  Thinking back now, I don't know a single "close friend" I had from those years.  One way or another things always ended in some kind of draconian judgment and "poof" they were gone.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Yes, what you describe was very much my experience, plus I found myself turning into one of the intolerant, harsh and brutal people. So I got out rather quickly!<br><br>I can't really imagine Objectivism ever involving a fifth of the world's population in some form or another, evolving a form of government that still going strong after 2,000 years, inspiring some of the world's greatest art, and generally being the biggest single influence in the world.

<div class="content">Wow Mark, who knew you had been into Objectivism too?!?  (see, that's why I like this forum, nobody I know in my 'real life' would know what I was talking about - except my son.)<br><br>Barbara Branden posted the following quote from N.B. on Objectivist Living (trying to help a fellow Objectivist determine the right goals for them):<br><br>"When admirers of Ayn Rand seek my services professionally, they often come with the secret hope, rarely acknowledged in words, that with Nathaniel Branden they will at last become the masters of repression needed to fulfill the dream of becoming an ideal objectivist. When I tell them, usually fairly early in our relationship, that one of their chief problems is that they are out of touch with their feelings and emotions, cut off from them and oblivious, and that they need to learn how to listen more to their inner signals, to listen to their emotions, they often exhibit a glazed shock and disorientation. I guess I should admit that seeing their reaction is a real pleasure to me, one of the special treats of my profession you might say, and I do hope you will understand that I am acknowledging this with complete affection and good will and without any intention of sarcasm. The truth is, seeing their confusion and dismay, that it's hard to keep from smiling a little.<br><br>"One of the first things I need to convey to them is that when they deny and disown their feelings and emotions, they really subvert and sabotage their ability to think clearly -- because they cut off access to too much vital information. This is one of my central themes in The Disowned Self. No one can be integrated, no one can function harmoniously, no one can think clearly and effectively about the deep issues of life who is oblivious to the internal signals, manifested as feelings and emotions, rising from within the organism. My formula for this is: "Feel deeply to think clearly." It seems, however, to take a long time -- for objectivists and nonobjectivists alike -- to understand that fully. Most of us have been encouraged to deny and repress who we are, to disown our feelings, to disown important aspects of the self, almost from the day we were born. The road back to selfhood usually entails a good deal of struggle and courage.<br><br>"I know a lot of men and women who, in the name of idealism, in the name of lofty beliefs, crucify their bodies, crucify their feelings, and crucify their emotional life, in order to live up to that which they call their values. Just like the followers of one religion or another who, absorbed in some particular vision of what they think human beings can be or should be, leave the human beings they actually are in a very bad place: a place of neglect and even damnation. However, and this is a theme I shall return to later, no one ever grew or evolved by disowning and damning what he or she is. We can begin to grow only after we have accepted who we are and what we are and where we are right now. And no one was ever motivated to rise to glory by the pronouncement that he or she is rotten."<br></div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>>>>  Yes, what you describe was very much my experience, plus I found myself turning into one of the intolerant, harsh and brutal people. So I got out rather quickly!  <<<<br><br>I hear 'ya.  I don't think I was at my best either.  But then I have a tendency to go whole hog into most things.  It is my way of testing.  I was able to "break" Objectivism in a relatively short time ... but as I say, not so much the philosophy as its implementation in economics, politics, ethics, and ... well, just as a way of living.<br><br>>>>  I can't really imagine Objectivism attracting a fifth of the world's population, evolving a form of government that lasts for 2,000 years, inspiring some of the world's greatest art, and generally being the biggest single influence in the world.

<div class="content">Ah, Jacqueline,  ever the fountainhead ;-) of information ;-) ;-)<br><br>Have you read this?  I've just started and so far t seems to present a straw man to knock down rather than to be a cool and logical analysis.  Even starting out using terms like "randians" sets off my alarms.  Surely a noted thinker can do better.  No?<br><br>But onward.  I shall read it and see where it leads.  I've always liked him from a psychological point of view.

<div class="content">Hi Mike, <br><br>I just read too much... it's an addiction, although AF is curing it.  :-)<br><br>It was an entertaining read at the time, it's been quite a while since I read it.  I like his irreverent style - actually, your style of discourse reminds me of Ellis, only he drops the f-bomb a lot, although I imagine your language is more colourful in real life too (as is mine).  <br><br><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/13/031013ta_talk_green" rel="nofollow">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/13/031013ta_talk_green</a><br><br>His work was pretty influential in my learning not to take things so seriously, stop worrying and generally get over myself .  I'm still working on that...<br><br>If anyone's interested, here's a quick summary of REBT:<br><a href="http://www.rebt.org/emo_disturbance.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rebt.org/emo_disturbance.pdf</a><br></div>
