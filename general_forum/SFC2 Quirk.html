<div class="content">Here's a quirk in the flow of SF that I don't think is really a PROBLEM but... it "breaks" the flow of the system enough that it has always bugged me (yes, I noticed it a while ago).<br><br>Here's the scenario:<br>Say I  have 3 open pages (47, 48, and 49). As I'm working on C1 of page 49, I come up with an urgent task that gets entered on C2 of the "next" page - page 47. I continue to work and add new tasks until page 49 fills up and I start writing tasks on a new page - page 50. That urgent task I added earlier is now no longer on the next page! And as I keep working, if I come up with still more urgent tasks, they will be added to C2 of page 50 which is the new "next" page. Of course how fast I move through the tasks on page 49 and 50 will be influenced by exactly *how* urgent that task on page 47 is, but... it just bugs me.<br><br>Anybody else noticed this? Bugged by it? Comments?</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>You are evidently using one of Mark's rule variations.  The official SF rules state that you put urgent tasks on C2 of the current page, not the next page.  If you are on the last page on which C1 is not yet completely filled, there is no need to use C2 at all.  That is my practice.  Your intuition will tell you which of the items is urgent, and you can just choose it and do it.<br><br>I've never understood why one would want to use C2 of the next page for something urgent.</div>

<div class="content">Even with the standard rules, Sarah's scenario can happen if column 2 on her current page (page 49) is already full.  <br><br>I've had this very situation happen several times.  <br><br>I've also had it happen that Column 2 on page 47 is already full, so urgent items get added to Column 2 on page 48 -- until page 50 opens, and then urgent items go THERE.<br><br>You can end up with urgent items scattered across 3 or 4 pages this way -- just by following the rules.<br><br>It becomes an issue especially if you have any Column 2 that is filled up -- because this triggers the auto-dismissal of Column 1 on that page.   This tends to make me want to linger on that page longer than usual, to take care of any Column 1 items that I don't want to get dismissed.  Which makes it take longer to get to the urgent items waiting in Column 2 on the next page.<br><br>It gets a little crazy.   <br><br>On the other hand, if the items in Column 2 on the next page are really urgent, then I tend to dismiss more readily so I can move forward to get to them.  And dismissal is always very liberating and exciting (once you get used to it).   :-)</div>

<div class="content">ubi, yes, I should have specified. I am using Mark's most recent experimental version (as described here: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1460996)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1460996).</a> But, as Seraphim points out, it can happen in original SF as well, if your C2s are very full.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br>I can see that definitely as a corner case. But, the rules allow you to bring some of the C2 items into current page (from wherever they are) as urgent, right?<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">GC, absolutely, it's just an interesting artifact of the adding of pages that caught my attention. It actually happens to me fairly often.</div>

<div class="content">I remember starting a thread about this myself when the first SuperFocus instructions came out, but I can't find it now. I think the thread didn't attract any further posts so no one seemed very worried about it back then!</div>

<div class="content">Mark, your entry "The Last Page" was posted soon after the release of SFv3:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/9/superfocus-the-last-page.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/9/superfocus-the-last-page.html</a><br><br>It was among your first set of how-to's, before you started the "Tips" series.</div>
