<div class="content">If you keep your task list electronically, what do you use?<br><br>I've been recommended 'Things'. Although I have an iPhone and iPad I don't have a mac - only a PC, so I can't sync it between the two (their iCloud solution is not available). I'm interested in other options.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alisson <br>Still using Omnifocus after 5 years. Anyway I rather prefer paper and use it mostly for collecting in one place all my project and really future tasks. For the rest I trust AF1 on paper.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alison<br><br>I use Toodledo.  Tasks can be organised in a variety of ways: by context, by folder, by dates, by goals etc.  It sychronises well across my iPhone, iPad and PC.  There is a free version but I use one of the paid versions (it doesn't cost much for a year though).<br><br>Having said that I have been gradually switching back to paper because I used Toodledo to list all my tasks - including Someday/Maybes, Waiting Fors etc.  I probably over did the use of Toodledo because to some extent I've become immune to my lists and got a bit bogged down trying to clear backlogs.  <br><br>So now I've gone back to using a notebook for various lists and limiting my use of Toodledo to a daily task list - regular daily tasks plus adding items from my paper list - and imposing some self discipline to actually get them done.  I'm also using it for some future tasks (e.g. I'll put in things that I want to do on specific days in the coming week) but I'm limiting these so that I don't clog it up again.<br><br>I like using the notebook because I get more of a feel for how long some of the things have been waiting to be done - and I like to be able to flick backwards and forwards quickly to see what I've done and also to pick out things that are about ready to be done.<br><br>I agree with Mark that Evernote is good for synching between platforms and I use that as well for notes.<br><br>Regards ... Colin<br><br>I</div>

<div class="content">Before Omnifocus, used Things.  I am also toying around with the simplistic Task Paper because it's "like paper" (thanks to Jupiter's comments).<br><br>Before Things, used Toodledo (the pay-for one).  However, resistance built quicker with Toodledo after it got over a relatively small size, but it still works excellenty with the other iDevices.     <br><br>For the more powerful task-management programs, I would also like to know what (non-Mac users) on this forum use in lieu of OmniFocus or Things (??).</div>

<div class="content">I also use a combination of Omnifocus and paper.<br><br>For a decent multi-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, iPad and Android and web) solution, give Wunderlist a try: <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/</a></div>

<div class="content">I am using Things now with great satisfaction, however before I switched to Mac, I used MyLifeOrganized (both iPhone, PC, Android and other versions...). It is highly customizable application to employ any time management system - GTD, AF, Covey, what you want. For PC, it was definitely the best I found during years using PC. <a href="http://www.mylifeorganized.net/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.mylifeorganized.net/</a><br><br>Wunderlist and Toodledo are also great options, however both lack the basic function which I needed - to ad-lib sort and changing the order of tasks as I need at the moment. I did not want to sort according to priorities or dates, only change the order of tasks as I wanted. Which is not possible (at least at the versions I used). That is why I was never able to use them.</div>

<div class="content">I use Outlook, and found it worked pretty well for all of the DIT/AF/DWM/SF variations. But I never found a good sync to mobile. (There are various Heath Robinson links through to Toodledo, but they are not totally frictionless). I've been using paper for the last year, though, and may have missed several tricks.<br><br>If tablet access was enough, you could always use Gotomycomputer?</div>

<div class="content">...and one more option is Google Tasks, I forgot that I used it quite a long time. Especially when using iGoogle customized homepage, you can set to see several different task pages (gadgets) at once, which is very convenient (and platform independent). Sync with iPhone is a breeze - I especially recommend GoTasks for iPhone as Google Tasks client (free when I used it).</div>

<div class="content">Still using my journal/Getting S**t Done setup. However I've been Beta testing zendone (zendone.com) and eying Midnight Inbox. ZenDone would be awesome if it wasn't web-based. Truly dislike non-native, web-based apps. Yuch.</div>

<div class="content">This will sound convoluted and complex, but once the setup is done then it's transparent.<br><br>I'm using Seraphim's OneNote implementation ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1600928#post1602699" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1600928#post1602699</a> ). When a note becomes an actual task, a quick key combination turns it into an Outlook task. That, in turn, gets synced to ToodleDo via Chromatic Dragon ( <a href="http://www.chromadrake.com/ChromaticDragon/software/ToodledoSyncInfo.aspx" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.chromadrake.com/ChromaticDragon/software/ToodledoSyncInfo.aspx</a> ) which flows down nicely to my iPhone and the Pocket Informant app ( <a href="http://www.pocketinformant.com/PIIP2/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.pocketinformant.com/PIIP2/</a> ). I'm also using the Google Calendar Sync tool ( <a href="http://support.google.com/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=98563" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://support.google.com/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=98563</a> ) to sync my Outlook calendar to Google and back down to Pocket Informant. As one last side note, I've been toying with MobileNoter ( <a href="http://www.mobilenoter.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobilenoter.com/</a> ) to sync my OneNote notes to my iPhone.<br><br>In summary:<br>* Note taking / AF processing in OneNote.<br>* Calendar / task reminders in Outlook.<br>* Mobile everything-except-notes in Pocket Informant.<br>* Mobile notes in MobileNoter.<br><br>MobileNoter is the only service that I require the paid version of. $15 a year (as of December 2011) isn't too bad.</div>

<div class="content">If you use OneNote for Windows, the official iPad and iPhone apps might be worth a look. They are free for up to to 500 synced notes, and the upgrade to unlimited seems to be a one-time purchase.</div>

<div class="content">I did look at the official OneNote app. There's no way to enter ink notes. There's no search. The notes were displayed differently on the mobile device than they were on the desktop. If I recall correctly, it didn't even have audio notes. Even in my limited testing, the official app fell far short of MobileNoter. I will admit, however, that I don't see myself taking a lot of notes electronically until I get my iPad (which I'm saving up for).</div>

<div class="content">I also like Taskper. It is the only software I tried which is really near paper. It syncs very well with Dropbox. AndAs long as you are syncing with Dropbox, you can revert to older versions of your documents from the Dropbox website: <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/help/11" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropbox.com/help/11</a><br><br>What is nice with it is that you can date each day like a project and drop all your tasks little by little. Then you can select them by tags or by a key word. You can also dismiss easily using a tag @Dissmiss for example.<br><br>Of course it syncs with iPhone, iPad, and Mac if you have task paper of course which is quiet cheap<br><br>The task paper solution is nice if you don't really need a professional and complete solution like omnifocus. As it is customizable like paper you can use it very easily. For AF1 I find it perfect easier than paper.</div>

<div class="content">Just to complete what I said yesterday and which was un complete about task paper and may be every digital system  "For AF1 I find it perfect easier than paper" Easier yes but paper gives indeed for me a much better control and is really incredible for dismissing.</div>

<div class="content">Good comments, as usual, Jupiter.  I think you would agree that the good news is that even if the two Mac software packages discussed here have more bells and whistles than other programs, I don't think it matters much.  <br><br>Anything that distracts you from AF principles is just that, a distraction.  I even find that the Day Plan can get too cumbersome and require too much focus during the day, so I want anything 'outside the system' to be simple.<br><br>If side lists and separate project planning are needed, and you prefer to do it digitally, then almost anything would work. <br><br>Project and side task lists are one thing; however, I find that trying to use any digital solution for AF defeats the purpose.</div>
