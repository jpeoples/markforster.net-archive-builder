<div class="content">There are basically two types of people. People who accomplish things, and people who claim to have accomplished things. The first group is less crowded.<br><br>— Mark Twain<br><br>This did make me smile. Made me think about how it sums up the way I feel now using RAF and how I felt when I was "busy" doing GTD ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Excellent quote. So happy to be in the former group now, thanks to AF.<br>And for once that's no idle boast on my part.<br><br>The other quote that now applies to me is this-<br><br>"If you want something done, ask a busy man."<br><br>Several people have said something similar recently.<br>That is sooooo different to how I was seen just last year.<br><br>Paul<br><br></div>
