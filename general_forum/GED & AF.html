<div class="content">I just finished reading Get Everything Done - loved it!  Mark, I love your writing style and all the illustrative stories.  I've been finding it very useful in my life.  I especially loved reading about what a procrastinator you were.  That makes me feel much better.<br><br>Has there been a post on how AF & GED relate?  I know I saw something on DIT & AF, but I haven't read DIT yet.<br><br>If there hasn't been such a post, how do AF & GED relate?  I definitely saw a lot of connections, but I just want to hear everyone's take on this.</div>

<div class="content">Balfour:<br><br>AF is intended to be a separate system from GED or DIT, but of course many of the principles are the same and there are many methods in GED which can still be used with AF - one example would be timed bursts.</div>

<div class="content">I am sorry to say I have never read any of Mark's books.  But I started using AF as soon as I stumbled upon it.  It seems to fit me like a glove.  (More so at work than at home, but it will progress.)<br><br>Because I like AF so much and have benefited from and enjoyed Mark's comments in the forum, I want to read something relevant that won't push me into breaking the way AF works.  <br><br>So what should I read?<br><br>FYI, writing this question is on my AF list and I can now cross it off.</div>

<div class="content">I'm re-reading Do It Tomorrow and it fits almost perfectly with Autofocus.  In fact, AF could be considered an extension of DIT.  Now I see why he'd be reluctant to write another book.  It's all there in DIT.  Perhaps he just needs to update it to include AF and give readers either the option of picking the system that works for them.</div>
