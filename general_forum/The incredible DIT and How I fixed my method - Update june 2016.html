<div class="content">Hi ! <br><br>Just an update of my method and how DIT changed my life. This follow my thread about DIT. Mark inventing this method has discovered a gold mine. I simple did it my way and I give it free to this forum in exclusivity before writing it may be someday on my blog. <br><br>- Very huge increasement of information whiched made me overwhelmed. <br>- Need to catch information as they come without beeing blocked by the system <br>- Need to sort what was worth on the information but also c<br>- Need of reporting on my contacts, my buidings, my client what was done or not<br>- Need of folowing people (800) to give them a real service, choose the best of them and focus on what needs to be done at the right time<br>- Need to inventing or find a method that will be right with my way of thinking and acting<br>- Need to focus on action and not procarastinating or dispersion on what is not relative to my goals and objective <br><br>Plan <br>1. Collecting all information about contacts for making emailings and call easely<br>tool : NIMBLE. It sort the best people and goes on the social networks to get information about what people gives. At one glance you know who people are and what they are doing. <br><br>2. Collecting informations. Use a paper note book. Here is my method. <br>a) Skip a few pages 3-4<br>b) On the first available date it « tomorrow » ie Friday june 24 th. <br><br>PLANNING<br><br>TOMORROWS PAGE : Treat it as an inbox<br>If you have an idea during the day put it here. <br>IF it is a note about anything put it here. <br>If you plan to do something put it here. <br>If something in incoming client etc put it here. <br>If there is and urgency put it here (but do it after writing it) <br>If you are writing something from others put it here <br><br>As there will be many information use colors (yellow for must doing things), green if you are waiting for something from other. Use bullet symbols dor that tasks (-), notes (.) urgencies (*)<br><br>TODAY’S page.<br>For starting the system just list what you plan to do today. You may use priorities. <br>report from Nimble, notes or every paper notes what is important and worth to do.<br><br>Now Act! Work on your today’s list, Do it ! report incoming stuff on tomorrow’s page.Dont worry tomorrow you will work and treat tomorrow’s page. <br><br>TOMORROW MORNING<br>- use a 4 colors bic <br>red make a revision of your notes on your paper book. Cross stuff. <br>- If nothing is available on a page cross the all page. This will help you to focus on what is important and left. <br>- Then make priorities. If you have an idea which absolutly needs to be done today report it on today’s page (only exception of the system) <br>- Choose you big rocks for today (NO MORE THAN 3)<br>- TRY to plan your core projects and think about how much time they will take. 3 minutes. <br><br>Then <br>Report stuff for following on NIMBLE. Make your prospection. Takes appointments. Make analysis of your buildings or projects Use your note book and the help of NIMBLE. ACT ! ACT! and ACT ! Forget all the system. Take habits. <br><br>Hope that's help. <br><br>PS Nimble cost 15$ until the 1 of july after it will be 20$ Or 25$. Users who subscribed will stay at 15$ <br><br>Thought ?</div>
