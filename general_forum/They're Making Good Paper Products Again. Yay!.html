<div class="content">As a teenager, I used Daytimer's wirebound series. They came with blank pages (and various forms) with cut-outs down the side so you could fit them into the wire binding. It was the best of both worlds. Smaller spine and you could fold them over, and you could also move pages around. (It's much like Levenger's Circa series, but not as bulky.)<br><br>This feature stopped several years ago. Apparently the former DayTimer clients (lawyers and executives according to the advertising images) all moved to PDAs.<br><br>Blueline's new Miraclebind has that feature. So far the sizes are only 8x5in and up. Calendars are daily, weekly and monthly. Yes, the cover can be bent back. No, they're not compatible with their other wirebound books.<br><br>Prices for their book and calendar pages look good. Lined refills are pricey, but a book with lined pages is reasonable -- so buy the book for the pages. Crossing my fingers that they don't plan to raise the kit prices once we're hooked.<br><br><a href="http://bluelineinc.com/vw/fs/p002.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://bluelineinc.com/vw/fs/p002.htm</a><br><br>Is it sad that for me, returning to my teen years means having a great organizer in my purse?</div>

<div class="content">Nice paper, too bad they don't offer a punch like Circa. If I could punch my own I might use it for my sketch books.<br><br>I'm like my " Midori Traveler" knock off. I made it try Erik's Kanban system (I still like the kanban best).  It is narrow size, flat and fits my shopping list off the frig and checks to deposit.<br>Here's more about them.<br><a href="http://blackcover.net/?p=42" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blackcover.net/?p=42</a></div>

<div class="content">Even if I repeat myself... There is a similar product to Wirebound series, it's called Atoma notebooks. One can find it under<br><a href="http://www.manufactum.com/Produkt/193587/1415134/ATOMA-Blank-Notebook.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.manufactum.com/Produkt/193587/1415134/ATOMA-Blank-Notebook.html</a><br>(search for "Atoma" to find the other products of this supplier). At least in Germany it's also available in the Manufactum shops.</div>

<div class="content">I like the cover material for the Atoma notebooks, I wonder where you can get just the cover material. I didn't see a punch on their site. The punch is the best thing about the Circa system.<br><br>I'm putting something together about how I made my notebook, details to come.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Christian G,<br><br>Wow, 119 Euros? That's kinda expensive...<br><br>I think the Circa punches are a bit more affordable; the Rollabind ones are more so.  However, Rollabind has a nasty reputation of delayed deliveries, so watch out.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for you interest in my notebook. Erik invited me to share the how- to instructions through his web site, Sources. He just posted it at:. <br><br><a href="http://bit.ly/cEnqMO" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/cEnqMO</a><br><br>Let me know if you have any questions.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Finally! I now have a reliable source of filler paper for my Rollabind notebook at Staples.  It's part of Staples' M line, called "Arc System."  They're available online now at the Staples website for pick-up at stores  (Just search for "arc" at staples.com) and supposedly due for stores in late December this year.<br><br>And the notebooks offered are not bad too.  GENUINE LEATHER covered 6 3/4" x 8 3/4" notebooks for $9.99, and  GENUINE LEATHER covered 9 1/2" x 11 1/2" notebooks for $14.99.  Hmmmm...<br><br>Thanks to D*I*Y Planner forums for the heads-up.<br><br>God bless!</div>
