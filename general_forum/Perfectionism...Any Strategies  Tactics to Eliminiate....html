<div class="content">Does anyone have any strategies or tactics to deal with Perfectionism.  I don't mean the kind that has you re-working something over and over to get it just right.  I mean the sort that stops you even starting something in the first place.</div>

<div class="content">To quote (my recurring reference) Robert Boice: 'Procrastination and Blocking (PB) is a problem of not knowing how to work patiently, mindfully, and optimistically ...... treatment of PB require interventions aimed at all three components (self-management, task management, and social management).'  The AF method relates to task management, but to work on your tasks you need patience (it's a long list), optimism (it's gone a be all right),  and avoid mindlessness.</div>

<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>Yeah, I know how that goes ;-)  This time I am determined to not just read the books but to set up a solid plan for change.  Procrastination has bedeviled me since I was a child and I'm done with it ;-)<br><br>I have started an organized review of my time management library, with particular focus on procrastination.  (I've discovered that books with good ideas about this don't always have the word "procrastination" in the title so I kind of have to review them all.  <sigh><br><br>I have started with the book "Overcoming Procrastination" by Albert Ellis and William J. Knaus.  (It looks to be no longer in print so when I have my notes completed I'll make them available to any who are interested.)  Beck usually has some excellent things to say so I'm hunting for him in my library.  (Gee, I wish I had not procrastinated reorganizing my library ;-)<br><br>Ellis is the founder of RET:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy</a><br><br>Which is similar to Cognitive Therapy:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_therapy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_therapy</a><br><br>The essence of it is that the source of any emotional disturbance is thinking and the process is:<br><br>Stimulus -> Emotional Response -> Behavior<br>Thinking -> Belief -------^<br><br>Since Beliefs are installed by some thought process or other, the point of attack should be on the kind of thinking that is being done.  (In fact, it can be argued that thinking is the ONLY thing that can be changed, directly, in this view.)  It is at this point that I part ways with REBT.  I agree up to the point of the chain of causality but I don't think it is necessary to reorganize thinking in order to affect change.  NOTE: I did not say I don't think it is USEFUL ... just not necessary.  Nor usually a very efficacious approach.<br><br>Anyhow ;-) Ellis lists three (and for some reason most things in his writings seem to come down to three things!) basic reasons for procrastination ... in fact all Emotional disturbance:<br><br>- Self-Downing ("I must do well.  If I don't I am a bad person so.  I always screw up so I should probably not even try this.")<br><br>- Low Frustration Threshold ("The universe must fit my needs.  Things should come easily to me and if they don't, I won't do them at all.")<br><br>- Hostility ("People must treat me fairly and do what I want.  He has no right to demand this of me.  I'll show him .. I won't do it.")<br><br>He seems to consider perfectionism as a wrinkle on the more general Self-Downing process.  Upon some introspection, I see examples of all three processes in myself with the emphasis shifting with context and perhaps time.<br><br>I think his ideas are interesting and useful, but his specific advice is much the same as you've read elsewhere.<br><br>For me there was one BIG take away from this book.  Not so much something I had not heard before but somehow it struck a big chord in this context.  Almost as an aside, as he is discussing Operant Conditioning, he builds this interesting chain of logic:<br><br>- What ever else you do in order to procrastinate (substitute activity)<br><br>- This constitutes a reward for the action of procrastinating<br><br>- The more you procrastinate the more you reward that behavior<br><br>- And the more you reinforce the habit of procrastinating<br><br>- However if you withdraw ALL rewards (do not select any alternative action)<br><br>- Then you tend to become bored<br><br>- And so the task being avoided does not seem so bad<br><br>- And you are likely to do it<br><br>- If you continue to deny rewards (to select alternatives to what you need to do) you will eventually extinguish the behavior as a habit.<br><br>Kind of obvious, I get that, but put exactly that way, in terms of classical operant conditioning theory it did ring a bell.  I also immediately connected it with one of Milton Erickson's favorite ways of dealing with certain kinds of behavior.  He would demand that the patient DO the unwanted behavior but ONLY that and NOTHING else.  This induced both boredom and rebellion so that the patient would then rather do the behavior he ultimately needed  do.  For example, a smoker might be ordered to smoke six, and exactly six, no more no fewer, cigarettes a day.  ("Who the hell does he think he is?  I don't have to smoke if I don't want to.  I'll show him!")  Someone with insomnia was instructed to sit in a chair, doing nothing for exactly two hours before going back to bed to try to sleep.  ("This is stupid.  I'm tired and bored and I'll damn well go to bed if I want to.")<br><br>Well, I don't know how much I've added to the discussion about perfectionism ;-) but I'll make my notes available when I've slogged through some more material and consolidated it.<br><br>Happy gobble day to all the U.S. folks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike, the examples seem to read opposite of your explanation of Operant Conditioning.  I think it's the double negative that makes it confusing.  Procrastinate is a negative word that means "don't do now", so "stop procrastinating" means "don't not do now".<br><br>To stop smoking, force myself to smoke.<br>To sleep, force myself to not sleep.<br>To stop procrastinating (i.e. to start doing), force myself to do nothing.<br><br>These only work if the wrong action is unpleasant, so the right action is preferred.  I think I understand now.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>>>>  the examples seem to read opposite of your explanation of Operant Conditioning.   <<<<br><br>In basic operant conditioning you:<br><br>- Give a signal<br>- Wait for the desired behavior to occur<br>- Reward the behavior<br>- Repeat until the behavior occurs reliably on delivery of the signal<br>- Then give random, large, unexpected rewards for a time<br>- Then discontinue rewards<br><br>In the case of the procrastination example the "reward" is the activity used to avoid the activity one really should be doing.  The idea here is that any activity chosen for reasons of procrastination is comparatively more desired than the one intended and so constitutes a "reward for procrastinating".<br><br>Over the years, continued delivery of the "reward" is bound with the act of procrastination and so continued reinforcement is also received.  This is what makes it an even more powerfully formed habit.  And there is worse news ...<br><br>Notice that operant conditioning requires the delivery of random, large, unexpected rewards in the later stages.  Without that, the connection weakens because the reward is expected and so work is not required to get it.  IOW, if the dog does not perform the trick you STILL need to reward him (at least a little bit) or you'll piss him off.  In addition, he knows that he can get the reward anytime he rolls over.  (In a sense, to reflect Douglas Adams, the dog and used operant conditioning to train you to give him treats when he rewards you with a trick!  LOL ;-)  OTOH, if he does NOT know if he will get that large unexpected reward or not, he will do the trick just on the off chance that this time he will get the big pay day.<br><br>In procrastination this works when we actually occasionally do NOT procrastinate.  We get a big rush for doing the job ... and that is our big pay off ... a hit of adrenaline ;-)  This makes the whole thing very insidious.  You're damned if you do and damned if you don't.<br><br>>>>  I think it's the double negative that makes it confusing. Procrastinate is a negative word that means "don't do now", so "stop procrastinating" means "don't not do now".<br><br>To stop smoking, force myself to smoke.<br>To sleep, force myself to not sleep.<br>To stop procrastinating (i.e. to start doing), force myself to do nothing.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, that's it.<br><br>>>>  These only work if the wrong action is unpleasant, so the right action is preferred. I think I understand now.  <<<<br><br>Exactly.  The wrong action can be pleasant but you remove it and substitute NOTHING (in the procrastination example) and that is very boring and unpleasant.  IOW, if you want to procrastinate doing those reports for work, do not allow yourself to go to a movie ... that is a reward for procrastinating.  Rather force yourself to do absolutely nothing ... and that will be negative reinforcement (a punishment) which will make the task you are procrastinating seem a better alternative.</div>

<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>Not just you!  ROTFLMAO ;-)  As to procrastination in general, Ellis says that there were no studies available when he wrote the book (late '70s) but estimated the incidence at about 95% of the population.  His whole institute deals MOSTLY with procrastination.</div>

<div class="content">I read Fiore's book a few times. It was a good read, but it didn't help me.<br><br>I read lots of Ellis's books (he wrote the same book 100 times). They are all great reads. But it really didn't help me.<br><br>I then read the David Burns book that Jacqueline mentioned, The Feeling Good Handbook. It is grossly mistitled. It should be called a workbook. It takes all of Ellis's theory and puts it into a beautiful 30-day program. The point is not to read the book, but to do all of the assignments as you go through it. It changed my life. And my level of procrastination dropped precipitously.<br><br>I also strongly recommend Marks' DIT book. It is a great read and you can use most of its theory as you do AF4.</div>

<div class="content">Hi moises, <br><br>One that I just bought but can't give a final review on (I'm only on Chapter 3, but so far it is very good) is the Procrastination Workbook by William Knaus (foreword by Ellis).  I think one of the keys is that most people just have certain things they procrastinate about.  For example, I have no procrastination issues with working to deadlines, lateness or perfectionism (anymore that is thanks to Ellis, Burns and co., I used to), but still have really bad what he calls "maintenance procrastination" habits/tendencies.  So it's pointless to work on something that isn't an issue.  I do think AF is very good for working with the maintenance procrastination, and so is my "do 15 minutes of housework daily", but other maintenance stuff falls through the cracks because it doesn't seem important I guess.  Yet it can be disruptive, so it is important.  I haven't got to that chapter yet, so we shall have to see...<br><br>I'll post what I find out about perfectionism here when I get to that part.<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Procrastination-Workbook-Personalized-Breaking-Patterns/dp/1572242957/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1259179759&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Procrastination-Workbook-Personalized-Breaking-Patterns/dp/1572242957/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1259179759&sr=8-1</a><br><br>Knaus is coming out with a new one in April 2010 too:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Procrastination-Now-Psychological-Approach/dp/0071666087/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1259180370&sr=1-19" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/End-Procrastination-Now-Psychological-Approach/dp/0071666087/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1259180370&sr=1-19</a><br><br>Yeah, unfortunately like Ellis, some of these books are just rehashed.  It's unfortunate.   At least Ellis' colourful language was entertaining.<br><br><a href="http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/its-never-too-late-to-stop-procrastinating" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/its-never-too-late-to-stop-procrastinating</a><br><br>Like they say in the article, I do believe that you can literally change the way you think permanently like it did for you moises, and as it has for me for perfectionism.  Now to work on that maintenance stuff.</div>

<div class="content">Perfectionism is an issue for me as well.  These days I allow certain 'non-critical' things to enjoy the full onslaught - which means they don't get updated (e.g. comic collection) for a very long time because it has to be done RIGHT.  That way I find I can dial it down on everything else.  I've got a few tactics to get round other cases where it becomes an issue - e.g. preferring a conversation to agree something with a confirmation email rather than doing it all by email which usually means I spend a long time getting the email absolutely right.<br><br>Regarding procrastination, my big obstacle is dealing with the intray on a daily basis.  I have attempted repeatedly Mark's approaches to tackling this, and the theory is sound, but I can't get past the fact that I don't want to do it.  Result - massive backlog and related stress which tends to impact other stuff.  <br><br>In almost every other area I've found that AF4 helps to tackle both the P words.  For me the rules allow enough flexibility to feel good about progressing something without getting hung up on completeness or quality.</div>

<div class="content">With procrastination, where possible I find it helpful to do a 'tangential' activity(s) first<br><br>So once *moving* in a related direction it's then easier to tackle a resisted task by changing direction a bit.</div>

<div class="content">Hmm, that's an interesting idea.  I've immediately experienced some resistance with that though, knowing that I'm going to try to cheat my way into doing whatever I'm avoiding.<br><br>Can you give any specific examples?</div>

<div class="content">For example if you don't like cleaning in particular, start off with a bit of tidying and then move onto some cleaning.<br><br>I wouldn't call it cheating, just a warm up/transition activity to get *moving* on.<br><br>Bit like joining a motorway/freeway, you can't just turn straight into high speed traffic, you need to drive up a slip road/on ramp and get up to speed first.<br><br>Another good tactic I find is to make a little 5-10 minute 'head start' on a resisted activity, have a break or do something else, then carry on.<br><br>Both these help build up efficacy before moving onto something more difficult.<br><br>For more on efficacy try a google search for 'Albert Bandura'<br><br>HTH</div>

<div class="content">If you really think you are a perfectionist, then here is how you get over that nonsense:<br><br>Find something you are terrible at (should be easy). Then go and do said thing with gusto in front of people whose judgment you think matters. Yes, they will judge you. And their judgments will probably be correct. But you will learn that doing things poorly and being judged does not kill you. WIth enough practice you will learn not only does it not kill you, but it doesn't really matter.<br><br>Find something you *think* you are good at. Spend more than a few minutes everyday proving why you are at best mediocre, since that probably is the truth. Learning that you are really not perfect or even "good" at anything you think you are will also not kill you.<br><br>In short, you will learn you can do nothing correctly or perfectly and it is no big deal. Perfectionism is an over-inflation of self-importance. In addition to the above you can always recall throughout the day: "I do not matter."  "I am able to do nothing right."<br><br>A realistic sense of your unimportance and incompetence can be quite freeing.<br><br>The above requires a capacity for honesty and willingness to practice which most lack.</div>

<div class="content">If you find you not a perfectionist (likely) and you are not doing things you think you should, the like answer is (wait it is a shocker):<br><br>You don't want to do them.<br><br>Most things people spend their time doing in life are unnecessary, so it is unlikely that what you "procrastinating" about is needed. As in perfectionism, honesty plays an incredible role in dealing with procrastination.<br><br>AF does a pretty good job at forcing these issues to the fore, but people like to develop tweaks to keep from making some difficult decisions about how they are spending their time and how they wish they were.<br><br>Rigorous honesty is uncomfortable and disruptive to a life led in less than an honest way. So most people will balk at just not doing what they don't want to do and continue to procrastinate. And spend a lot of time figuring out systems to defeat their wishes.<br><br>The kinda honesty I am speaking of here and above usually only arises after times of crisis. And even then quickly is given up.<br><br>AF is a powerful tool for beginning to get honest on a regular basis outside of crisis. I thank Mark for it.</div>
