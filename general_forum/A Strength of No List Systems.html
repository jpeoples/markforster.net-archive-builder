<div class="content">One feature of No List systems which I really like is how they act as a scheduler.<br><br>To schedule tasks one can use tools like a tickler file, a calendar or DIT's Task Diary.<br><br>No List systems schedule every task that is on that list which is no list. These tasks are all scheduled for NOW and they will get absolutely done at this specific point in time.<br><br>You schedule tasks to secure 100% that you will action them. With a No List system you have this genius situation of being able to schedule several tasks - to secure you are actioning them - while at the same time not having to schedule anything in advance. (Which usually entails a lot of guess work about the upcoming days…)<br><br>The only non No List system I can think of having that feature is FV.<br><br>When Mark wanted to create a systematic version of each of his No List systems, he said that there is no need to create Systematic The Next Hour because FV is already that.<br><br>So, FV is a No List system. Therefore, I guess, there are no other systems with the scheduler feature, unless they themselves become No List systems.</div>

<div class="content">Does that mean FFVP is also a no-list system or does the differences between FV and FFVP negate that?</div>

<div class="content">I would say the latter is the case, because with FVP you do not have to finish the chain ever. That's one of the features of FVP: you can always just pile on. It's good. But it leaves this "scheduling" realm then.</div>

<div class="content">Can't you 'simulate' FV with FFVP (cf. the revised post of FFVP), and doesn't that mean it may have similar no list properties?</div>

<div class="content">What is the difference then between doing FV and simulating FV via FFVP? Help me out, I can't see any!</div>
