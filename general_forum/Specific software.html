<div class="content">Hi, George<br><br>No, there's nothing specifically designed for the "Do It Tomorrow" system. As I've often written, I find it easiest to use paper and pen. However it's not very difficult to adapt Outlook to it.<br><br>Mark</div>

<div class="content">Hi George, <br><br>I use MyLifeOrganized (MLO) and I have managed to adapt it quite well for use with DIT. Its a Task Outliner that works on Windows and PPC. I like it because I find its good for mapping out things like Projects.It also has some good recurring tasks options which I find especially useful for Continuous Projects.  All in all a good List making program.<br><br>More importantly there is a great development team, and I have been able to request features for the software that I think will assist in making it more DIT compatible. <br><br>Anyway here is the link <br><br><a href="http://www.mylifeorganized.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mylifeorganized.net/</a> <br><br>You can run it for a 45 day trial period. It also links to Outlook as well.<br><br>All the best<br><br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">Whatever you use, pick something simple that fits your routine. I use Outlook at work, so I use the task list, with views set up for reverse, forward and review modes. <br><br>Keep it as simple as possible. Set it up so you can just type (or drag and drop) each new task in without setting flags, dates or whatever. Even if it seems like a small extra burden with huge benefits, a couple of weeks in you may start to miss tasks in the heat of battle.<br><br>If you decide to use Outlook, I'd be happy to share my view settings. <br><br>Good luck!</div>
