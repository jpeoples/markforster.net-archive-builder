<div class="content">Greetings everyone.  <br><br>I am using Seraphim's excellent RTM method currently.  It works great.  <br><br>I was just curious if there were some good systems out there that people have had success with for tracking bad habits.  <br><br>e.g.  <br>Less than 1 hour on social media<br>Only eat chocolate 3 times per week.  <br>Don't snooze<br>In bed before 10pm<br>etc...<br><br>Basically, I think I'm going to just add a section for habit breaking and list them down like a FVP style list, and see what evolves.  However, I'm sure others have tried various options that might give me a shortcut.  :)<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="content">I haven't spent much time with RTM but the concept of stopping bad habits is interesting to me.  I see you alluded to it in your write up in the other post but I have more success in  replacing bad habits with good ones instead of just simply trying to stop them.  <br><br>So my approach is to identify a replacement habit I want to cultivate and then work to get rid of all the resistances to the new habit so it becomes more of a default than the bad habit.  <br><br>For example, when I was traveling weekly for a consulting job, I didn't want to just spend my evenings in the hotel watching TV.  I made the goal of never turning on a TV in a hotel room.   The only way I was able to successfully do that was to replace the TV habit with making sure I had a good book with me on every trip.  The book replaced my TV habit.  <br><br>Like you mentioned in the other post, I also  struggle with scrolling on my phone,  so I try to make enticing enough goals/replacement habits that work for me in the moments that scrolling is the most enticing.   (low energy and boredom).  My  current antidote is  journaling or sketching.  So my real task for  breaking a "stop scrolling" habit  might be   "Open Notebook and  sketch or describe what you see"  <br><br>Since the phone is so handy, I do have notebook and sketching apps on my phone that have a more prominent placement on my screen then the hidden social media icons.  Eventually muscle memory kicks in and I spend a lot more time journaling and sketching than I used to.  Which was my goal.   The added benefit is that my lists (mostly FVP) are in those same notebook apps so I am reminded to look at that too.  <br><br> Oddly, I find some clarity in sometimes journaling about my lists :)</div>
