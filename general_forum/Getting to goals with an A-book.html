<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-8 15:08</div>
<div class="content">Re-reading "How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life" (Alan Lakein), I was reminded again of the importance of eliminating  "C's", because most people will do them AT THE EXPENSE of "A's".  <br><br>Here's some excerpts from Chapter 10 - Tasks Better Left Undone:<br><br>"Why do people have this strong tendency to get bogged down with C's?  One reason is that many activities of top value cannot, by their very nature, be performed well."<br><br>"With all these things going against executing a hard A-1, is there any wonder you look around for something you can do well?  One of the things you can do well is clear up all the easy C's.  And you justify it by saying you are clearing them away so that you will then be free to do the A-1 later."<br><br>"You have very cleverly set up a situation where you won't leave the house until you empty the garbage, won't do the A-1 until all the B's and C's are out of the way."<br><br>"Since you know you're not doing A's, you can waste time and gain the feeling of doing something well, starting something easy and finishing it, crossing an item off your list, and moving the paper from your in-box to your out-box.  But don't kid yourself:  it's because you're doing all those C's and not because you haven't any time, that you don't get to do your A's."<br><br>Lakein's answer is "You need a C-Drawer."  "Rather than let the high-quality A's get buried by the much larger quantity of C's, try reserving a special place on the top of your desk for the A items.   Create a special "C-drawer" where the unimportant items can get dumped safely out of the way."<br><br>Within the context of AF, to ensure one really practices Pareto's 80/20 - is the solution to have an A-book and a C-book?<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>I don't think the solution is to have multiple books.  I like my approach ... For each item I enter, just after entering it I ask: "Am I really really really commited to doing this in the coming week?"  I'm sure that challenge question can be modified to ask about priority as well.  In any case, if my answer is NO!, then the item is IMMEDIATELY dismissed.  Writing it got it recorded (caught grass) and dismissing it kept it out of the way of the higher priority/importance tasks.<br><br>The counter argument seems to be that one ought to let the item simmer on the list until the dismissal rules get rid of it.  If one does that, there is a chance one may see the value in doing it.  But, as you and Lakein point out, that is exactly what you do NOT want.  You don't want reasons to do more things, you want more things out of the way of what you have decided is fundamentally important to you.<br><br>Beside, when you review your dismissed tasks (weekly?) you'll continually see that item and have the opportunity to add it back.  So it is really just "simmering" out of sight, but still simmering ;-)<br><br>This is an important idea, in my view.  We can see how well the opposite approach works as a reminder TO DO things we want to do but forget.  Put the running shoes in front of the door so we can't go out without moving them, for example.  If it is out of sight, it is out of mind.  If it is IN sight, it is IN mind.  It is our choice to decide which to do when and to what.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Mike, <br><br>I think the lightbulb went off w.r.t. your method now.  I didn't really get it before and thought it was too much maintenance.  My apologies, I know you have more years of experience w/this stuff than I do and we share the same outlook.  I don't think it's as good of a method unless it's in the hands of someone who's using it properly - ie. to focus on the important things.  OTOH, maybe it does force focus on important things -I'd just be worried it could do the opposite.<br><br>Hmm, I've never reviewed dismissed items.  But maybe I wouldn't have to more than once a week - the one thing that I really exceled at w/GTD was doing the weekly review.  :-)<br><br>Here's my dilemma though - if I did work the list that way, I am afraid that I would (during the week) add stupid C's to the list and then unconsciously just select them to do (because the damn things are *easy*).  Another dilemma is that I put things on the list right away - even if they're not due for a month.  I really like doing that because nothing gets missed.  I freaking hate using a calendar because I like getting things done early and a calendar makes me put things off.  And many of them are C's (that could morph into urgent - bills and such) - because hey, that is 80% of the crap that comes up.<br><br>My other concern is that I think you are more self-disciplined than I am. :-(<br><br>Just a question - why not use a master list and a week at a glance calendar with a page for tasks?<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi learning, I hope you feel better soon.  It breaks my heart that you have to go through so much and still manage to maintain such a positive attitude.  (((BIG HUG)))<br><br>I was doing something similar to this with AF condensed, but I wasn't focusing enough on those important things, because when I culled my list for the day, those C-s just pop out so naturally.  I have managed to put a cap of 15 minutes on the daily cleaning (one of my goals IS to have a home that I'm at peace living there - which means no tornados facing me when I walk in the door.)  Capping it at 15 minutes means I have to literally MOVE like a tornado to get it done in that time.<br><br>What you have said is why I was thinking of using 2 books.  One that I use for 30 - 60 minutes as you suggest, and one that I use as a "current initiative book" for another hour plus every day - if there's only an hour I can spend in a day, I split the time evenly.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Joseph, I just don't look at them after they're highlighted / dismissed.  If they really needed to be done, they'd come up again naturally and go on the list.  If I dismissed them because they weren't a priority why would I clutter my list with them again?<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-8 19:36</div>
<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>Perhaps I misunderstood the concept from its inception? My impression was that Mr. Forster recommended highlighting "dismissed" or "up for review" items precisely because one can then skim them and decide what happened: 1)did I not want to do them in the first place? 2)was it a pipe dream? 3)do I still want to do it? 4) *why* didn't I do it? 5) how can I rephrase it to make it more doable? 6) do I need something else before I can do it? 7) etc.<br><br>I had thought that this is what "Review Mode" was, and also why, even in AF1, one highlighted but didn't scratch out or erase "dismissed" items.<br><br>If you used an electronic format AF list you would complete delete the item?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Joseph<br><br>P.S. For the GTDers, someone pointed out how highlighted items were naturals for a "Someday/Maybe" list.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-8 20:37</div>
<div class="content">I understand what you're saying Joseph, and I think it might depend on the individual.   <br><br>What you are doing with the list of questions is something that I do while operating my list.   I'm not sure of what you're saying by highlighting the "up for review" items?  You don't do that unless you dismiss them.  If I was going electronic, yes, I would do just like I do with my email inbox - delete it permanently or do the task.  It's the same concept.  In your email, do you keep what you haven't done in some holding subfolder and review that occasionally just to hunt down something to do?   If it was unimportant to you, but important to someone else, they'll remind you.<br><br>In the early days of AF1, I had a real dumping problem.  I operated under the delusion that I could (and should) put everything I thought of onto the list (even all of my house renovations.)  When I look back at those first AF pages of Jan. 5, I can see how scattered (and overwhelming) this approach was.  ie. trying to renovate every room of a very large house almost all at one time.<br><br>The problem for me is that I can be a do-er - put it on a list in front of me, and I will do it.  Whether it's the right thing to do or not.  Things stand out very easily to me as "ready to be done", unfortunately.     <br><br>In looking back at the finished pages of the last 7 months, I can see that about 60% of the items got put back on my list (without me ever looking back on them) or the issue went away on it's own, about 30% of them I'll do at some point - but again, I will likely put them on the list again when I've cleared up other projects and have time for them.  Another 10% were just brain burps that I really don't want to waste my time on.   <br><br>I would wager that in the early days, I dismissed more than the average person - because I really took to heart the rule of "if nothing stands out on the page, the whole page is dismissed."   <br><br>And at what point do you stop reviewing the dismissed items?  When they're 3 months old, six months old, 2 years old?  I really don't want to be looking at "make pumpkin pie" and "request holidays for Easter break" once a week or month for the next couple of years.  I'm sure I'll think of making pumpkin pie one day in the future without that reminder.<br><br>Today was the first time I have reviewed my 7 months worth of dismissed items (about 250 of them), and you know what?  There's not one thing I would put back on my list right now.  Well, maybe "Watch Rome season 1".<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>Thanks for the explanation of how you handle it.<br><br>You said:<br> <<I'm not sure of what you're saying by highlighting the "up for review" items? You don't do that unless you dismiss them.>><br><br>I was attempting to use both the "old" term and the "new" term here. In AF1 and AF2 unactioned items got "dismissed" (and highlighted). In AF things are "up for review" (and highlighted).<br><br>*Before* something was dismissed it was "up for dismissal" or "in danger of dismissal" (i.e. above the line in AF2). I believe the language used currently in AF for items *before* they are highlighted is something along the lines of "a candidate for review". It doesn't seem to be in the spirit of things to say "in *danger* of review" : )<br><br>Likewise I believe the current terminology for something that actually gets highlighted for review is that those items are "up for review", i.e. when you switch to review mode *those* items are up for review.<br><br>Can anyone confirm/deny? I think I've got Mr. Forster's system on this correct, no?<br><br><< If I was going electronic, yes, I would do just like I do with my email inbox - delete it permanently or do the task.>><br><br>Interesting. That is precisely what I would not do, if I wanted to follow the AF system as is. If I deleted items that get dismissed or put on review. . . well, then, what would the rule "switch to review mode" do?<br><br>Perhaps the genesis of my questions can be explained by the caveat that I'm trying to follow the AF rules as laid out by Mr. Forster. I need to make sure that i understand them first and give them a proper shake down first! Then *maybe* I'll tweak them a bit.<br><br>That make sense? Thanks for the discussion!<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Hi Joseph<br><br>It sounds to me as if you've got it right. I do understand though Jacqueline's point about not wanting to wade through loads of "dismissed" items (sorry - still prefer the original terminology :-) ) What I have done to avoid that problem is to analyse my dismissed items into 4 categories<br><br>Dismissed - Not To Be Done<br>Dismissed - Actioned Subsequently<br>Dismissed - Review Later<br>Someday/Maybe<br><br>That keeps my list of items for review pretty small, as everything I have now actioned or decided I am not going to do has been removed from that review.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Joseph, yes, you are operating correctly via RAF w.r.t. review mode.  I'm not operating RAF though, I'm using the original AF, which I feel is the better system - apart from *my* problem of letting the list get clogged up with lower value tasks.  Of course, I could just dismiss more quickly a la Mike, because unfortunately those tasks stand out.   <br><br>I'm glad though that you prompted me to go back through my dismissed tems to confirm that there wasn't some magical life changing task that I was missing.  I imagine that if I was operating RAF, I would just keep dismissing the "change to review mode" task and the issue would be resolved. :-)  <br><br>I remember years ago when I first got the goal to get to "inbox zero" - I moved everything from my inbox to a backlog subfolder thinking I would plug away at it over time, filing and actioning items.   To my surprise, I never went back into that subfolder again.  <br><br>From this blog post discussion, it looks like there's a lot of variation in people's m.o. - some are like me, who don't get value from review, and some are not.<br>  <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/6/13/autofocus-a-closer-look-at-dismissal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/6/13/autofocus-a-closer-look-at-dismissal.html</a><br></div>

<div class="content">I think with AF2 and RAF it is far more needful to review the dismissed items than in AF1.<br><br>With AF1, items are on the list a lot longer and so they are more likely to be genuinely dismissed, in the sense that you have touched on them so many times, and decided so many times not to do them.<br><br>With AF2 and RAF, items are dismissed (or put on review) so much quicker, so they are more likely to need to be reviewed.<br><br>Wooba</div>

<div class="content">Hey Jacqueline,<br><br>>>>   think the lightbulb went off w.r.t. your method now. I didn't really get it before and thought it was too much maintenance.  <<<<br><br>The maintenance is minimal.  Just take a moment to think if you WILL do it next week ... if not, as you say, it will come up again.  I dismiss it and review the dismissed items weekly.  But I find that I have lots of repetition.  If I were not to review for a month I might have half a dozen entries about some thing ... which indicates that I probably ought to do it or talk myself out of wanting to do it ;-)<br><br>>>>  My apologies, I know you have more years of experience w/this stuff than I do and we share the same outlook. I don't think it's as good of a method unless it's in the hands of someone who's using it properly - ie. to focus on the important things. OTOH, maybe it does force focus on important things -I'd just be worried it could do the opposite. <<<<br><br>Well, how would that question ... or a better one of your devising ... increase the importance of the unimportant?  Suppose you ask of every item you put on the list ... "Is this truly going to get me to my long term goals more quickly?  Or is doing it going to prevent unnecessary trouble down the road (like not filling up the car when there is 1/8 tank left?<br><br>I think that would be a helpful filter.  Now you don't have to put it on the list at all, if that is your style.  Not everyone is bothered by just ignoring things.  I am, however, and I found that the grass catcher helped me in that it allowed me to forget about the item knowing it was safely handled and I could get back to it.  It is kind of fooling myself, I suppose, but it works for me.<br><br>>>>  Hmm, I've never reviewed dismissed items. But maybe I wouldn't have to more than once a week - the one thing that I really exceled at w/GTD was doing the weekly review. :-)  <<<<br><br>Yes, I love the weekly review.  And I would NOT review more often than once a week.  And in that review, some number will be tossed for good.  As you say, you don't review them forever.  If you have decided that it is too close to the bake sale to bake that pumpkin pie, just cross it off and put on your list: "Call, Mary.  Sorry, no pie."  Easy peasy.  ;-)<br><br>>>>  Here's my dilemma though - if I did work the list that way, I am afraid that I would (during the week) add stupid C's to the list and then unconsciously just select them to do (because the damn things are *easy*).  <<<<br><br>But why would you if your challenge question is designed to filter them out?  Don't let C's sneak in there.  Challenge them and dismiss them straight away.  Or, if you don't want to put them on the list at all, just forget them, the'll be back ;-)<br><br>It all comes down to how much overhead you want.  I think keeping too books is more overhead than dismissing from the one book and reviewing later.  To each is own.  We all have different feelings about what things represent too much work.<br><br>>>> Another dilemma is that I put things on the list right away - even if they're not due for a month. I really like doing that because nothing gets missed.  <<<<br><br>And I have that covered.  They get dismissed right away and reviewed every week.  When the time is right, they get added back in and you know you have to do them.<br><br>>>>  I freaking hate using a calendar because I like getting things done early and a calendar makes me put things off. And many of them are C's (that could morph into urgent - bills and such) - because hey, that is 80% of the crap that comes up.  <<<<br><br>Well, Covey had it right in this particular case.  The quadrant system handles it well.  Q4's can morph to Q3's then to Q1's and it pays to notice that as it happens.  As you say, 80% of life is Q4 that becomes Q1 if ignored.<br><br>>>> My other concern is that I think you are more self-disciplined than I am. :-(  <<<<br><br>Not so sure about that -- you saw how much trouble I got into with AF2 and how long it took me to figure it out! ;-)<br><br>>>>  Just a question - why not use a master list and a week at a glance calendar with a page for tasks?  <<<<br><br>What would be on the master list?  I'd use the week-at-a-glance but it would not fit in my pocket so easily.  And, I more more task focused than calendar focused.  I don't have that many dates that drive me.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>Ah! I see, I didn't realize you were working solely in AF1. I'm giving AF ("raf) a run for its money.<br><br>Wooba:<br><br>Brilliant! You hit on it. Dismissal in AF1 happened after more iterations through the items, with plenty of chances to do them if at all. So, truly, if they were dismissed there was likely *something* off about the item (either it was phrased wrong, or circumstances changed, or you changed, or you just don't want to do it, period). So "going back to it" wasn't the most useful thing in the world. (see Jacqueline's point, above).<br><br>But dismissal in AF2 and on review for AF ("raf") works differently. Those items didn't have as much of an appellate process. . . . you might not have gone over them for some time.<br><br>Very keen of Mr. Forster to change the terminology to reflect this -- from "dismiss" in AF1/AF2 to "on review" for AF.<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Joseph, I think the "review mode" came up partly because people (myself included), really resisted getting rid of tasks.   Heck, I even told Mark that I wanted the AF2 inexorable *line* of doom vs. the inexorable *page* of doom.   <br><br>Oddly enough, when operating RAF/AF2 method, I dismissed more readily than in AF1.  If 4 tasks were on notice in AF2, I would usually dismiss 2 and do 2.  Unfortunately, I had a lot of one-blocks of unactioned tasks.  I will admit that a couple of times, I cheated and put a whole page up for review just so I could dismiss / do more.  I like that feeling of pressure.  :-)<br><br>I do feel somewhat guilty about complaining as I pull a Tim Ferriss once in awhile - my son does work for me as my "personal assistant" of sorts.  For today, I gave him tasks to do that are C's and a few A's, and I bought myself peace of mind for $100 - money well spent.  :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Andreas,<br><br>>>>  >>I ask: "Am I really really really commited to doing this in the coming week?"<<<br><br>In my understanding this is almost the opposite of the AF system.  <<<<br><br>Well, be that as it may, things have a nature and you get from them according to their nature.  If you put things on your list that you don't intend to do, they you get different results than if you put things on you intend to do.<br><br>>>>  In AF, I put every task on the list, but I DON'T KNOW whether I am committed to do it or not: It is in the moment the task stands out that I know it. Or, how Mark puts it: Let yourself surprise what you will do next.  <<<<br><br>That is one way of running the list, to be sure.  If it works for you, that's supper.<br><br>>>>  My experience after - hmm - thirty-five years of fiddling around with goals, projects and all that other self-management-success-achievement-stuff is that a lot of our goals are, in fact, stupid. At least a lot of mine have been, and I have achieved a lot of goals that were no achievement at all on a scale of happiness, but merely a waste of time and energy.  <<<<br><br>Yes, Mark has made that argument to me.  I have found the opposite to be true.  My values at the time I set the goals determined those goals and they were not stupid, given those values.  Now over time, my values have shifted somewhat, and so some goals have also changed.  However, we do the best we can given our state of knowledge at the time.  If we waited for perfect understanding before acting, nothing would get done.<br><br>>>>  On the other hand, nothing is as powerful as a motivation than a goal that appears reachable. Milestones, fueled by imagination, can really put us in fast forward mode.  <<<<br><br>I agree.<br><br>>>>  So, what I do is: I maintain a (short) list of GOALS in my WEEK CALENDAR: Things I'd like to have achieved/completed by the end of the week. Ordered by importance (=if I had to choose only one of them, the one I choose is nr. 1, and so on).  <<<<br><br>I do as well. But those are driven by longer term goals.  I may have "Finish Reading Book X" on my list, but reading that particular book is driven by the goal to learn about that subject area.  And that is driven by the goal to become more educated, etc.  Goals exist in a hierarchy.  You would never study for an exam if you did not have the goal of passing the course.  You'd never want to pass the course if you did not want the degree.  You'd ... well, you get it.  Later in life my may indeed decide that getting a degree in that subject to make your life's work Y, was not what made you truly happy.  You'd rather have learned basket weaving in a commune or something ;-)<br><br>>>>  But what I have to actually DO goes on the AF list.  >>><br><br>So far I'm with you, except that some of my short term goals are also on the list rather than put on a calendar.  But it amounts to the same thing.<br><br>>>>  Everything. (With the exception of appointments and other time fixed tasks.) Because this is where my subconscious - which is, I hope, wiser than my conscious thinking - can interfere.  <<<<br><br>Ah, so either you are not plagued by the kind of overactive mind that sees excitement in every thing that crosses his path ... or you have a list of crazy stuff like plagued me.  Think about it, I can't be the only one ... the name "grass catcher" was not invented by me.  The existence of that term, and the problem is solves indicates that others have confronted distraction and found that recording it, putting it OUT of mind (not reviewing it 10 times a day) and getting to making a decision about it later helped keep them on track.<br><br>>>> As far as Lakein is concerned: He surely is a honorable ancestor of today's self management systems, but I firmly believe that what he teaches only provides results if you forget enough of it so that some fuzziness may come into play. He's too rational, and RATIONALITY LIMITS!  <<<<br><br>Well, that is were we profoundly disagree.  The alternative to rationality is irrationality and I have spent my life working to enhance the former and eradicate the latter.    I fully understand the role of the subconscious mechanisms of the mind ... and I see those neither as irrational, nor divorced from thinking.  It is precisely when the subconscious functions are NOT based on reason that they produce results which cause us pain.<br><br>Certainly tying one's shoes in the morning (a largely subconscious act) is a helpful function of the subconscious mind.  But being afraid of closed spaces is not.  Both are examples of the subconscious mind working according to the rules WE gave it earlier in life.  The first is from a set of instructions that is helpful, the second, not so much.  But BOTH are an invertible result of our nature.  The only difference is that the first set of instructions was rationally arrived at (at least by your parents ;-) and the second not.<br><br>So I will have to disagree with the use of AF as a tool to avoid thinking.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas, <br><br>Re. stupid goals, I find that when I am less conscious about my goals is when they become stupid, or I forget the essence of what really makes me feel fulfilled.  I think that Lakein's method of determining goals cuts to the heart of that and makes your goals smart.  Particularly this question: <br><br>"If I knew now I would be struck dead by lightning six months from today, how would I live until then?"<br><br>Previous to this, I didn't have a single task on my AF list related to spending more time with friends and family which would be one of my top goals if I truly did only have 6 months to live.  And I rarely had any tasks relating to this throughout my list of the last 7 months - as a consequence, since starting AF, it seems I've spent less time with my friends than ever (and too much time on this forum - because I like talking to people, and this method of relating is effortless - not that I don't think you guys are great - but I really should be spending more time with my physical friends).   <br><br>I think this is because AF can be somewhat reactive vs. active.  Also because I tend to think about work a lot, which isn't what I'd be doing in my last 6 months.  So, since I am reactive as well with respect to making sure I spend time with my friends, if they call me and suggest meeting up, I will go, but I rarely think of calling them.  But in reviewing that goal, I can put contacting friends on my list and be more proactive.  In that case, I wouldn't want the filter of one week, because I want to ensure I get around to it, and knowing me, I'd dismiss it for now.<br><br>Re. Lakein and rationality limiting us, in a nutshell what he's saying is - go for what really leads to results, go for what makes you happy and fulfilled.    Quit wasting your time on doing or over-doing things that can be deferred or delegated or that don't provide any value to you.  Improve the quality of your choices.  How can that be stupid?  <br><br>We do have to be rational about it because people's brains are essentially irrational and our *intuition* is more often just animal instinct dressed up with a fancy name.  Intuition is great - IF what's on the list isn't stupid and a *relative* waste of time to begin with.<br>  <br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>RE: Dismissing meeting with friends.  Why no?  Really!  If you are not actually willing to call a friend this week, should you not face that fact and see what your values are?  And if you dismiss it, so what?  Next week, it will be there staring at you again and you'll have to ask why it is being put off.<br><br>One thing that helps with that is to put a "tick" against each item you review on your someday maybe list.  Or a tick each time a thing is dismissed.  It will prompt you to ask why you have put this off for 12 weeks.  Certainly that suggests you ought to be questioning your values and time allocation ... no?</div>

<div class="content">I have to say I agree with Andreas regarding putting everything into the list.  Using the unfiltered task entry basis and intuition gave me far more insight into the roots of my procrastination than any form of rational thinking.  Yes I knew rationally what I need to do but the fact that I wasn't doing it, despite having all that rational knowledge, was a pretty good indicator that, for me at least, rational thinking just didn't cut it.<br><br>AF1 totally surprised me, not just in the volume of what I achieved, but by identifying how some of the tasks I viewed as unimportant actually had a significant impact on my wellbeing in varied and sometimes pretty subtle ways.<br><br>With AF2 and RAF my focus is somewhat different in that I am somewhat more selective about what goes on my list BUT that is partly because I have pretty in depth experience of how AF works and realise that with the revised version the speed of action has increased to a degree that I can be pretty certain that virtually everything that goes on my list will be done and done soon.  Consequently it has been a practical step to build in a time lag by the use of better diarying of future events but random thoughts can still go on the list and if necessary actioned by being sent to my review list, which is in two sections - to review later and someday/maybe.  Consequently I have ready access to all those potential tasks or wish list items which I can choose to include in my list when the time is right.<br><br>With the exception of holiday type "must do before leaving" checklists, I have never had so much confidence in the ability of a list of things I wish to do, to actually get what needs to be done done, and done at the right time. Whilst my line of doom is still moving through March (yes really!) I only have 21 active tasks dated since I started AF2 - and only 83 active tasks now in total.  I started AF2 with 362 active tasks and have entered 450 new tasks since that date, so, to me at least, that is pretty amazing!<br></div>

<div class="content">Hey Christine, so glad it's working great for you!  Don't get me wrong, it's still working great for me - I just want it to kick it up a notch and work even better.  For me, that means the answer is two-fold - making sure that what's important goes ON the list to begin with - and that I don't sacrifice that to the mundane.  Of course, if the maintenance activities are critical to my well-being, they become A's and are not C's.  I will still want to do them - I just don't want to sacrifice my life to C's.  Mel, you know what I mean - something like cooking your meals for the week when you're following BFL is absolutely an A-level activity because you will eat crap if you don't have those meals prepared.<br><br>I look at time the same way that I do money.  We don't have an infinite supply of time, just like we don't have an infinite supply of money.  So when you get your monthly paycheque (or 24 hours of time), you take care of the important things - you pay the mortgage, save XX%, buy groceries, etc.  Whatever is left, you spend however you want - if that's lattes at Starbucks or clothes or a vacation, it doesn't really matter because you've taken care of the essentials.  But some people will buy lattes or shoes and put it on their credit card, and won't be able to make the mortgage payment because of their spending habits.  And some people won't save that money for the future to follow their dream of early retirement or a lake cottage, or whatever their dreams happen to be because they're spending it on grande frappuccinos - which is a shame, because they think they CAN'T get there, but they really could if they identified that goal.  <br><br>So sometimes, you do have to say "I'm not going to buy that grande frappuccino because if I do, I won't be able to retire early."  Or maybe that's just me.  Yes, it probably is just me.  Like my son says "mom, if the average consumer was like you, fast food places would go out of business."<br><br>Re. the money analogies - sorry, I've been working all day reviewing legal claims with my brain immersed in finances - the only thing keeping me from going buggy is to post here.  And of course, I am just doing this job for the money - mama needs a new pair of shoes!  (Or more likely, new kitchen cabinets.)  :-)</div>

That is exactly what I find.<br><br>I know I am a lot more fluid when it comes to goal setting that both you and Mike but the fact that AF has enabled me to get more of a handle on my motivations has enabled me to see that, actually, I am not as far off track as I sometimes feel - it is just that I have realised that some of the changes I made "as a result of circumstances" were made for valid reasons and therefore kept me on track with my values if not always with my wishes.  Looking back, I can see the lessons learned on those occasions when I have "gone off track" and those are valuable lessons - not always pleasant but at the end of the day (horrible phrase!) the benefits of those experiences outweigh the inconveniences.

I'm writing this because of these values:<br><br>- I value clarity of my thinking and writing here helps me rethink things ... the writing itself helps me clarify for myself.<br><br>- My mind is not focused well this morning so I'm avoiding doing other things that I need to be doing ... the value of my taking some time off is in conflict with the value of having certain other things under control.

But when I see an old clunker motorhome go by when I am driving to work, I'm pea green with jealousy that they can travel during the week while I'm stuck going to work at a job I'm not excited about.<br><br>I'm jealous of people's houses that are neat all the time.  And people whose dogs behave well and don't go crazy over balls.  People who can sleep in and don't have a wacky internal clock.  People who are decisive and don't dither about what colour of off-white tile to buy.  People who are skinny naturally and say stupid things like "I crave vegetables" or "I forgot to eat" (well, I do that one sometimes) and don't have to always work at it.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike I think I would use REWARDS instead of VALUES. In my heart of hearts, I value honesty. I believe it is one of the greatest goods. But whether I tell the truth or not in a given situation has to do with rewards and punishments. Simple B.F. Skinner stuff. If I can be thought well of and not punished for misleading someone, I may very well do it even though I still value honesty. Because I have a conscience, I will be grieved by my dishonesty which may change the reward/punishment balance next time. In other words, I may think about how guilty I'll feel if I'm not honest.<br><br>I think that's exactly what happens when it comes to task management. If I value my kids, but give way to the quick reward of web surfing rather than reading to them (which can be punishment sometimes - lol), I will feel guilty. Therein lies another aspect of the problem. Those things we most value are not always rewarding. Often they require us to forego reward and even endure punishment. To live according to one's values, we must rise above our carnal natures. Those who believe in nothing but the physical (I am not in this camp) may believe that we aren't capable of rising above our carnal natures. Therefore, values=what you do=what is most rewarding. On the contrary, I believe living according to one's values is a constant battle that I must engage in, no matter how many times I fail.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>You raise an interesting point.  I'm going to give it some serious thought.  My first take on it is to do a reductio ad absurdum ... that often points me in the right direction.<br><br>- I value A<br>- I do B rather than A<br>- Because B is more rewarding and/or<br>- A is more punishing<br><br>So I'm thinking, how is it that I can say I value A more?  If I don't do it because of a reward/punishment calculation, how can I think that values have any meaning whatsoever?  If I come at it that way, the things of highest value to me are the things which give me the most reward.  But you have already said that you don't believe that reward (pleasure) is the most important thing.  More important are those things you value, like your children.  So where does that put us?  Reductio ad absurdum, we should do only what gives us immediate gratification and avoid any long term gain that might come with some negative attached to it.<br><br>As you said, being human is about seeing into the future and placing long term pleasure above short term.<br><br>So as to your honesty example ... that is a seductive one.  Yes, it is easy to construct a case where it seems pointless, or even cruel to tell the truth.  But honesty is more than about this person and this event at this time.  It is about one's own relation to facts.  To be honest is to recognize the facts no matter what anyone else thinks or feels.  To do otherwise is only to find reasons to not be honest.  And if one finds reasons to not be honest, then one is valuing it less than other things.  I can't see any way around that.<br><br>Well, there have been libraries written about this stuff.  I think, in general, values and the operation of them in our ethical systems has to do with US, and not others.<br><br>But I'm going to chew on this further ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mike/Mel<br><br>The whole issue of honesty (or perhaps better related to integrity) is a lot more difficult to pin down than we often realise.  I would suspect we would all say that integrity is one of our values and that we can be quite blase in thinking that "truth" is something easily definable and that we know the right thing to do. Whilst I do have very clear opinions in that regard I have found my sense of "black and white" significantly challenged when faced with a parent with dementia asking about their parents.  I think learning summed up the dilemma when she referenced not telling a concentration camp cammandant that an escape tunnel was being built - evading the question may not be being honest (as in truthful) but does that breach integrity?<br><br>At the end of the day we are all answerable for our maintenance of our levels of integrity - the more we depart from the actions dictated by our conscience the more desensitised our conscience becomes .......... <br><br>Interesting debate ........<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>In my day we used to call that "lifeboat ethics" ;-)  IOW, you can't develop a system of ethics based on what you might have to do in an emergency.  And to make it all the more difficult, it begs the question of what is an emergency and who defines it.<br><br>To go back to first principles we need to look at how philosophy is organized: <br><br>- Metaphysics<br>- Epistemology<br>- Ethics<br>- Politics<br><br>in that order.  The order is important because that is how what we know aligns with what is.  First we consider what is, then we consider how we know, then we consider how we relate to others, then we consider how we relate to society.<br><br>With regard to "truth", we must first consider what "is" and how do we know it and are we willing to put that first in our understanding of our universe and our place in it.  That is a hell of a tall order and we have not even gotten to the lady next door asking if her coughing annoys us, let alone the concentration camp guards.<br><br>Obviously there are cases where the literal recitation of the facts is not what is called for.  It depends on circumstance ... but that is a difficult road.  If I'm a doctor I'm not going to give a patient just out of unconsciousness some very bad news that is likely to hurt him.  My JOB is to help and part of helping is managing the "truth".  But I don't do it simply to benefit myself or make myself feel better.  I'm "treating" at the time.  (And, in that regard, medicine has taken a very wrong turn since the days of the medicine man.  In those days, he'd say "Drink this and you'll get better."  And you might.  Or you might die.  No matter, it was the best he had to offer and he was unambiguous about it.  Today doctors say: "I don't know for sure.  If you take this you have a 53.754% chance of improving.  If not, then your chances are only 48.271%.  But hell, why not get a second opinion ... I'm probably just a dunce after all."  Of course, our insane legal system has had a lot to do with it, but still.  If you want to help, tell the person he is going to get better if he follows your advice.  He may.  Or he may not.  But his chances are better if he believes in you.  O.K.  Pet peeve off. ;-)<br><br>Likewise, if a person is going to do me harm, then I'm going to protect myself and just as if I would kill to do it, I would lie as well.  In the fist place "killing" is not "murder" and in the second telling a falsehood is not telling a "lie" ... his use of force on me has put him outside of any requirement upon me to respect his life or his right to the truth.<br><br>The slope gets very slippery though when we start to apply lifeboat ethics to our everyday lives.  If our everyday lives were indeed a lifeboat situation ... our first obligation would be to fix that!  So if I continually lie to someone because I don't think they can handle hearing the truth or I want to make life simpler for myself ... the problem is that I'm undermining my own sense of self.  I'm essentially saying my feeling comfortable or not stressed is more important than my relation to reality.  And worse, as time goes on things just get worse until, someday, I find that I don't even know any longer what is true.  I just say whatever works.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>As I say - interesting debate .......... :-)  All very valid points - as I said above we all have a responsibility for our integrity and to listen to our conscience and as you say making life simpler by lying would most definitely impact upon that.  What is the impact of colouring the truth - or evading the question upon our integrity?  In the majority of cases there is often the ability to be truthful and evade the question without causing offence.  For example, in the case of the coughing neighbour rather than a lie - "no your coughing does not annoy me" it is easy to say, "well I do hear you but please don't worry about it, I understand how difficult it is for you".  I think though that some people would not necessarily consider the need to avoid what they would term "a white lie".<br><br>Curious the use of colour references in relation to truth ....... black and white, shades of grey, colouring the truth ...............<br><br>I think this is one of those debates which could become circular so as you say - something to chew on :-)</div>

The second time around was "what can I do in the next couple of weeks that will make the biggest difference, bring me peace of mind that it's taken care of, or that I really enjoy."  It reminds me of the advice I try to follow for decluttering - "keep it if it's useful or beautiful."<br><br>I'm not dismissing on my A book because most of the work I do on it needs the larger chunk of time I have on weekends.<br><br>I've even become motivated at my regular job.  I'm choosing my few most important things to do for the day, and after those are done, just picking through my inbox in an AF kind of way, looking for what stands out.  I was so unmotivated after coming back from holidays in July and actually have stuff in my inbox to do (only about 25 emails, so it's not a huge backlog), but it was always empty before.<br><br>I've only been working on the C book for about 1/2 hour a day, one day I didn't even open it.  :-)  What having the two separate books does for me is force the conscious thought of "you are choosing to do unimportant things at the expense of what is important."  And it does it a lot better than the old Covey A1, A2 way.  So far, so good...  <br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mike, holy moly, I'm not sure I have enough brain cells firing to respond to your post! lol I can say that I do believe that transcending the pull of rewards/punishments to live according to one's highest values is rare, but possible (think Braveheart). As for your discussion of specific instances, I think one always has to look at intent/motive. Our legal system certainly does. Did you shoot someone to prevent him from shooting someone else or because you wanted to take what he had? Of course, we could discuss the issue of whether someone's motives were virtuous or not. Everyone will have a different opinion. Some would be furious not to be told the whole truth by a doctor. Others would be glad. As for honesty, I try to live by "speak the truth in love." I don't always do one aspect of that (either I'm not entirely truthful or not entirely loving), but it is my value. You might assume that I'm not a big fan of "whatever works" ethics and you would be correct. But I also know that this is exactly how most of us live. It's also a very complex world we live in that offers no easy answers to our ethical dilemmas. Judging others' decisions (especially those with different values) is not my job. My guess is we could chew on this subject for a very long time. ;-)<br><br>Jacqueline, thanks so much for the update! I realized that the system I use of associated lists is very much like what you're doing. Only A's (time sensitive, important, highly rewarding) tasks go on my main AF list keeping it very streamlined. All the non-time-sensitive tasks that I may not ever get to go on electronic lists by category (blog posts to write, organizing projects to do, etc.). So far, I absolutely love the idea I got from Mike to review these associated lists each week and choose those tasks I'd like to accomplish in the next week. Only these associated-list tasks go on the main list. I don't plan on doing any formal dismissing from these lists. Only during my weekly review will I delete those I no longer wish to do. <br><br>Strangely enough I was really enjoying using paper for my main list! I started using the idea of putting tasks on one page and notes on the other. Now I am testing Tony's iPhone app. The biggest advantage of the app so far is the ability to automatically re-add the task to the end (like Andreas's web app). That is a time saver. Time will tell what I end up relying upon.</div>

<div class="content">Mel, it seems so interesting that you and Mike are basically doing AF condensed, only on a weekly, not daily basis.  At the time I was doing AFC, I thought of the regular AF list as my "master list" and my culled tasks as my "hope to do" list.  I wasn't as good as I could be at picking the priorities though.  I think I knew I could make myself feel good temporarily by crossing off lots of C's.  <br><br>I don't know, will time end up telling what you rely upon?  Or will you just keep adding tools to your tool chest, coming to a better and better mousetrap all the time?

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>What I meant was the fact that under AF1 we were encouraged to put everything into AF - ie without grading - and to let the system (our intuition) sort it for us.  That did work really well for me until my lists got too big, and it was with the advent of AF2 that I realised I had inadvertantly created a form of grading by the addition of my "easy" repetitive tasks on each page, such as Coffee; check forum etc.  Maybe grading is not strictly correct but I was adding a higher proportion of known non-urgent tasks which then enabled me to procrastinate legitimately.  AF2's Line Of Doom does not give an option - it is Do or Die whereas I had got a lot of tasks that were in the "how long can I avoid this for" bracket.<br><br>I'm not sure I've explained myself any better - I see why you were confused - I was too when I read it back :-)  I'll blame it on the time of day (night!) and lack of sleep!!!  <br></div>

It can make keeping up with repetitive, mundane chores difficult, but even then I try to find new approaches to make them (or rather, me) work. I am using a today list within  the FocusPad app right now. I just went through my list and highlighted my hope-to-do's for the day. I really like that they are within the main list (no looking back and forth) and I can't help but peek at the non- hope to do's. You know what will happen.

<div class="content">Chris,<br><br>>>>  Can anyone give us a thumbnail definition of As and Cs? And Bs and Ds, too, if helpful. <<<<br><br>They are priorities and so have no deffinition beyond that.  If you have 10 tasks to do you pick the top three.  Then of that three you decide which is the TOP priority and that is an "A", the next is a "B", and the third is a "C".  You do that for each "area" of your life and this gives you a list of several A, B, and C tasks.  You then examine the B tasks, and triage them as well.  You sort them into the A and C lists according to importance then forget about the C list and go to work on the A list.

<div class="content">Hi acedia, <br><br>Your intuition's ability to choose what will move your life forward and being able to define what's important must be much better developed than mine.  The essential problem - which I mentioned in the first posting - is that relatively unimportant "C's" tend to dominate my list.  Put something on a list in front of me, and I will do it without really thinking about it much.  <br><br>The A-book hasn't created resistance, it's removed it.  It's precisely *because* A tasks are, by their very nature, more difficult to do than C's that they are resisted - so your intuition will often "pick" an easy C (that may have no real impact on your life) to do over the worthwhile A.   At least mine does.  <br><br>It uncomplicates things *for me* because I'm not even looking at what's not particularly value added when I look at that A-book.  When I work off of the C-book, it's because I've said to myself 'you've done enough of the hard, fulfilling work today, let's do some maintenance stuff'.   Or because nothing's really standing out in the A book right then.<br><br>You've said before that you don't really have written or conscious goals that you are working towards.  I've been like that in the past too, and drifted along just reacting to whatever comes up.  It doesn't work well - *for me*.   I have big dreams and hopes - and they don't include seeing on my tombstone one day "her house was really clean."  <br><br>Yes, eventually those high value tasks were getting done using regular AF.  Probably about 4 times longer than they would using an A-book.  Personally, I was spending 80% of my time doing things that had the least value.  I want to flip that around and spend 80% of my time on the 20% that have the most value.  Why anyone wouldn't want to do that is beyond my understanding.  <br><br>In the discussion on goals eons ago between Mark and Mike, Mark indicated that consciously working on his goals never really worked for him.  Well, it HAS worked for me, and extremely well too.    Scheduling just stopped working for me in the way that it did years ago when I had less responsibilities.  It's just so much easier doing it with AF and the A-book  than with scheduling, which makes it feel more like you're pushing yourself.<br><br>Time will tell if I can maintain this enthusiasm and this pace.  I certainly hope so.  As Shaw said "I want to be all used up when I die."  And he also said "life isn't about finding yourself, it's about creating yourself."<br></div>

<div class="content">Acedia, my problem with OAF was adding everything to the list. I have a large home. I can fill up several pages just walking through my house. That closet needs to be organized, I need to wash those walls, that cabinet needs decluttering. Add to that the number of books I want to read, blog posts I want to write and you've got a great big mess! The problem is none of those things was a priority. <br><br>I DO believe in letting our intuition choose the right tasks to do, but when your list is cluttered with hundreds of tasks, most of them not priority (what Jacqueline calls Cs), the system breaks down. At least it does for me. I need to be able to get through my whole list every day and I need my list to be free of too many of these "would be nice to do" type tasks and ideas.<br><br>My current approach is to have associated lists. In a sense this is a someday/maybe list but broken down by categories such as organizing, blog posts to write, books to read, not urgent errands to run, etc. Anything within those categories that is time-sensitive goes on my main list. So if I have to read a book to get ready for the lit class I'm teaching Thursday, it goes on the main list. Otherwise, I just have READ on my main list.<br><br>A new tweak I've added to my approach that I absolutely love is to review my associated lists at the beginning of each week to determine which of these non-urgent tasks I'd like to complete in the coming week. Using READ as an example, I review my associated book list and choose a book or two that I am committed to reading in the coming week. I write it next to READ in my main AF list. I have been testing the FocusPad iphone app this week and this app makes this method ideal. If I want to read two books this week, I can have two titles written next to READ and can keep duplicating that task without re-typing for as long as it takes. If I finish one book and not the other, I can just edit the task and remove the completed book.<br><br>This approach gives me the perfect way of determining which of my A's should be done now while continuing to make progress on C's. To me, it really is a GTD/AF combination. What I do NOT do, however, is think, "I'm at the computer. Where's my computer list?" That kind of contextual task management just seems silly to me because I have access to a computer most of the time. Instead, I have "Process starred email tasks" on my main AF list and if there are emails that are time-sensitive and/or very important, I add them directly to the list. It keeps things from falling through the cracks. My list (would it be a paper list) would only be 7-8 pages long. Very manageable! But one thing I have learned is to each one's own. If OAF works beautifully for you, keep at it!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>Although I'm not an AF'er (I'm a weekly hybrid quasi-DITer), I was struck by your culled weekly aims list being 7-8 pages long !  How many items per page?

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>Thanks for your reply.  <br><br>One of Mark's earlier comments that I treasure is the importance of saying NO to things.  If I walk through my house, I also see many things that 'could' be done, but I say 'no' to them, just as, in other circumstances, I might have to say 'no' to a work colleague trying to hand off a project to me.  So most of those things won't even make it onto the list.  In other words, my AF list is not a list of everything I might ever want to do.  I don't have such a list.  When something matters, then it goes on the list.  Currently, my guest bedroom is a dumping ground and will stay that way until either there is nothing else to do (unlikely this century!) or I have a guest coming to stay - then I will add it to the list and deal with it as and when it stands out.<br><br>Sadly, after investigating several time-management / productivity systems, it seems to me that none of them enable one to do more than is humanly possible!  As I have limited capacity, I am focussing on limiting the amount I attempt to do - simplifying my life, as I think it was fashionably called, a few years ago.<br><br>May we all succeed at what we do, by AF or any other means!<br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>acedia</div>

<div class="content">Hi acedia,<br><br>I see the difference now - you are essentially doing the same thing that I, Mike and Mel are doing - except you're filtering rationally BEFORE putting things on the list, and we're filtering rationally AFTER it's on the list.  <br><br>You're not letting your intuition filter your list for you according to this statement:<br>"If I walk through my house, I also see many things that 'could' be done, but I say 'no' to them."  <br>And this:<br>"When something matters, then it goes on the list.":<br><br> And with this point, just substitute the word "pre-filtering" for "ABC":<br><br>- it prevents your intuition from telling you what is truly important. Presumably the ABC  people actually want to do this. But for anyone who has benefitted from the way that AF allows intuition to play its part, the ABC system would be a mistake.<br><br>You put only those things that you want to put focus on (ie. your priorities) on your list - I take off everything on the list that isn't a priority.  Personally, I don't see a problem with your pre-filtering, I only wish I could be that disciplined ahead of time but I know I have dumping tendencies.  I can't see the difference between how we're operating (except I'm probably wasting time by writing it out in the first place - but those things creep on there and multiply behind my back.)  My eyes always were bigger than my stomach.  :-)<br><br>I think what I failed to explain as well was that I am doing AF in pure form, except that I'm not dismissing in quite the same way on the A-book (just giving myself more time), only because sometimes I can't do some of the big jobs that I have on the list on a weeknight.  Where I can, I work on those items little and often, but things like tiling or a 5 hour hike aren't little and often tasks and aren't things I really want to dismiss on a Wednesday night at 9 p.m. just because I can't do them right then.  <br><br>I hope that "Focus" doesn't turn out to be the new F-word - something that needs to be avoided.<br></div>

<div class="content">Interesting thread after being away from the forum for a couple of days!<br><br>I do agree with acedia regarding intuition but think we all have different ways in which our intuition guides us with AF.  I know with AF1 I put anything and everything onto the list - let my intuition get to work - and found it really revolutionary, in that it didn't just go for the simple or "C" type tasks, or go for tasks that I would have graded as "A"s.  It was that very anomaly (as it seemed) that really enabled me to look at WHY tasks were standing out or not and that was what enabled me to see why I was behaving in a certain way with regard to certain tasks or groups of tasks.  I know that my AF1 list did get unmanageable eventually - but in retrospect that was because I started grading and doing what I felt I ought to, rather than really letting my intuition have total free reign as I did in the beginning.<br><br>With AF2 and RAF I now do similarly to Mel, in that I have separate project type lists, but that was already evolving under AF1 for me.  I am more likely to put "project x" than the individual tasks but am progressing those projects more easily and in what feels like a more orderly fashion.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">acedia, I just wanted to thank you - I've been practicing pre-filtering what goes on my lists based on priority as you do and it's working wonderfully.  Much better than dumping and then filtering because that would leave me with only a few tasks on a page at times.  I've been staying steady at about 4 pages in my A-book and 5 pages in the C-book.  Doing this for the last few weeks since you mentioned it has completely stopped the tendency for the number of pages to creep upwards constantly.  <br>I'm also finishing more projects rather than using my time to start new ones at the expense of finishing of what I already had going on.  <br><br></div>
