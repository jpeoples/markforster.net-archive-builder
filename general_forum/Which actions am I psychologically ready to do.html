<div class="content">To answer my own question with some principles:<br><br>1. I often have expectations of what I ought to be doing, either out of duty, obligation or avoidance of boredom or fear of being seen as lazy and unproductive. i don't mean these can be eliminated but that the primary driver is...<br><br>2. the feeling of enthusiasm is my indicator of what is best to do - enthusiasm and passion are my inner engine and I'd like to come from a position that enthusiasm shows me what is best to do on any day. Today it's the enthusiasm to DO not much and BE peaceful!!</div>

<div class="content">There are still lots of things which we have to do which it's difficult to find enthusiasm for. I don't think I could ever get enthusiastic over putting out the wheelie bins for instance. But if I don't do it then my rubbish won't get collected.<br><br>So the fact that I do succeed in putting out the wheelie bins would suggest that I'm finding some other trigger than enthusiasm for doing that task.</div>

<div class="content">Surely autofocus tells you that the bins don't go out until you feel like doing that?</div>

<div class="content">For me, Autofocus keeps pestering me about the bins till I'd rather just do it, instead of getting pestered about it.  Or, if I really don't have time for it -- way too busy with meetings at work or whatever -- I can at least ask one of my teenagers to do it.   <br><br>Eventually, "just doing it" becomes the path of least resistance -- easier than ignoring it, and easier than dismissing it.</div>

<div class="content">I think the "path of least resistance" is at the core of the "standing out" concept -- the resistance goes away, and it just becomes easier to do the task, rather than continuing to skip over it or dismiss it.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br><< Surely autofocus tells you that the bins don't go out until you feel like doing that? >><br><br>No, AF tells you to take out the bins when the tasks stands out on the list. It will do that when you are psychologically ready to do the task, which is not the same as being enthusiastic about it.<br><br>I've described to you in another thread recently that "standing out" is more like a release or letting go than any form of emotion, including enthusiasm.</div>

<div class="content">There may be 2 things going on here.<br><br>"Standing out" is a release of tension, in Robert Fritz's sense, of a return to equilibrium.<br><br>"Enthusiasm" is more about moving toward a dream, in the sense of what would contribute to our joy</div>
