<div class="content">A work in progress, here's my first attempt to distill Barbara Sher's Wishcraft system into 7 steps (step 7 "begin" could also be read as "begin autofocus"):<br><br><a href="http://drop.io/avrummusic/media/document" rel="nofollow">http://drop.io/avrummusic/media/document</a><br><br>Feedback is welcomed. <br><br>The entire book is online for free:<br><a href="http://wishcraft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wishcraft.com/</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br><br>Thank you for posting this.  I didn't really want to read the whole of Wishcraft right now because I've spent quite a lot of time in what I would call the "discovery" phase of identifying what I want - right now I think the value in Wishcraft for me will be giving me a structured way of planning how to get there.<br><br>At first read the instructions make sense.  I particularly like the questions for breaking down subgoals in step 6 - simple but effective.  I'm going to work through the process and will let you know if I discover any problems when I'm actually using these instructions.<br><br>I've printed off Chapter 4 of Wishcraft to follow your references in Steps 1 and 2 so that I can double-check that my goal is defined as well as it can be and write my problem list.  My real interest is in the steps beyond this but I think an a couple of hours this evening taking a quick look at these steps will be worthwhile.<br><br>I will report back!<br><br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">As I recall, Wishcraft can be divided into 2 parts:  wishing and crafting.  The wishing section focuses on identifying and clarifying goals.  The crafting section focuses on how to move towards achieving those goals.<br><br>I would clarify that your distillation is for the crafting half of wishcraft & include a reference to the first half.<br><br>Barbara has a forum.  That might be a great place to get additional feedback.<br><br>I enjoyed your distillation.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>Will do ... as soon as I get back from some errands.  I read the book years ago and IIRC, the value of it to me was the justification of the system and why it works.  I will certainly feed back on accuracy and any confusions, but readers ought to know that a list of steps is rather sterile in comparison to a well written book.  That ought to be obvious to anyone with a pulse, but hey ... ;-)</div>

<div class="content">@Lucy - thanks<br><br>@Kathy - <br>"As I recall, Wishcraft can be divided into 2 parts: wishing and crafting"<br><br>Good call. Actually, I'd say there are 3 parts:<br><br>1) Wishing<br>2) Crafting<br>3) Barn-raising or working with others i.e. isolation is the dream killer<br><br>I'll provide references (page/chapters in wishcraft)  regarding the 1st and 3rd parts. <br><br>Having read Wishcraft 2-3 times, I wondered why I had trouble implementing the process. Of course, a Success Team would have helped, but I preferred the company of one other... not many. Alas, after perusing various GTD flow-charts, I figured a similar tool would help me implement Wishcraft. So far, the results seem promising.</div>

<div class="content">@Mike -<br>"readers ought to know that a list of steps is rather sterile in comparison to a well written book. That"<br><br>I agree. I'm hoping the document will be helpful for people who have read Wishcraft. Also, it'd be great if the document serves as a catalyst for others to read the book. <br><br>Wishcraft is the only self-help book I recommend to clients. I don't do it often, but when i do, I endorse Sher wholeheartedly.</div>
