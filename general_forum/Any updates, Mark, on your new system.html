<div class="content">Sorry, no. Nothing to share with you at the moment. When I do have something to share, I assure you I will share it!</div>

<div class="content">Oh my...Nick, I don't think this was hounding at all.  I was just asking how things were going.  It is an expression of my keen interest.  I don't remember Mark posting anywhere to "leave me alone and don't ask questions about my new system".  So...I will continue to periodically ask how things are going....because of my interest.  If Mark wishes for me to not ask, I am sure he will speak up and say so!<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">As David says, I'm perfectly happy to be asked.<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark.  I will try not to ask for a while!  I am just so very interested of course and that is why I ask for status updates.  If I did not care....then I would not be ask or even be here.  Obviously, I do care!<br><br>Mark, I do hope you are well.  Take care.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, looks like I came on a little bit strong, sorry for that, I am interested myself.....and look forward to seeing what happens when it happens. <br><br>I have a lot of respect for Mark and his methods (have actually finished reading DIT which is great) GED was great too.<br><br>Best Regards Nick</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nick,<br><br>No problem!  Yes, DIT is great....and I must admit, sometimes I do miss it even though AF is outstanding.  And I do believe there are a lot of people out there that have stayed with DIT.  <br><br>At any rate, best wishes and stay well....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I read DIT for the first time about 2 weeks ago and so it was new to me, some of the methods are good such as dealing with interruptions e.g. defaulting to doing things tomorrow rather than putting out fires (which is what i seem to do all day). unfortunately i can't put daily tasks in a task diary as mine is not suitable but some things to think about especially with regards to being more like 'Mick Cool' as opposed to Joe Slobb!!<br><br>Having said that, AF is really good, I must admit i haven't tried it properly - had things stuck on a list for months and not referred to it - I must try it properly one of these days!! <br><br>I do like the idea of just sticking everything on one list so everything is in one place........</div>

<div class="content">Nick:<br><br>Of course the one way to ensure that a time management system won't work is not to use it!<br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by saying that "mine is not suitable". I recommend in the book buying a new page-a-day diary exclusively for use as your Task Diary.</div>
