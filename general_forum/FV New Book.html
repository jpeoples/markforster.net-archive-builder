<div class="content">It has been more than half a year now that I have been impatiently waiting for Mark's FV book. The book that will include his most up to date thinking on productivity and his final system.<br>Three months ago, I have emailed him asking about it. He told me that he had been busy with other projects so did not start working on the book yet.<br>I emailed him again a month ago, no answer.<br>Anybody has news on the book?<br>And don't tell me "Just read the blog archive". If that was the best way to do it, Mark's new book would be a collection of blog posts.<br>If all else fails, what do you think changed in Mark's thoughts on productivity since the DIT book?</div>

<div class="content">I would also dream about a new MF book but not only about FV but also about a book like getting things done explaining a all personal organization including advantages and inconvenient about each method he has invented and may be advising us to chose one system or another depending on our king of job or flow of incoming information. <br><br>Of course, there are many books about time management and personal management. But, for me, MF is the only one who made a simple system for acting and made it work. (I still like GTD but for organization) <br><br>So I still love AF, I personally still work with AF4 because I feel more comfortable with this system than with FV (I don't like open list which discourage me). <br><br>My lack is still about the way I go over it, ie working on projects, thinking and applying objectives, organizing all the stuff except acting on things = what is over the simple task system.  I would dream about a book which would simply explain, steps by steps, how to making the perfect simplest system for acting and organizing stuff. <br><br>Of Course David Allen did it but the system is to complicated. So for me it is really over what a simple human can do. May be it is the reason why most of people fall of the system. And as a business maker it doesn't suits me at all. <br><br>Instead, MF made some systems which are rational and intuitive. There are more suitable for business men and independent people. I never tested all his systems but only most of them. <br><br>And what I love with him is the operational way he chose. DA is sometime more "intellectual" than "practical". MF is practical and it is easier for me.<br><br>A real book well done would help independent people like me to have a real guide to make and organizing things. This could really free me and free many many people.</div>

<div class="content">I agree 100% and in many ways, that is what I am hoping for. Especially the part about recommending different productivity systems based on what we work we do, and our degree of self discipline and interruptions etc. Yes, a complete final book that offers a complete Mark F. view on everything related to productivity, prioritization and decision making, organization, and achieving our goals and dreams is what we all hoping for from this book.<br>So, it makes much more sense now why Mark feels writer's block and didn't start this important book yet :D</div>

<div class="content">I would say that, even if Mark wrote a book, it would at best be a snapshot of what he thought and what his practices were at that time. Unlike the other TM gurus, he is not driven by a profit motive to remain beholden to ideas developed a decade or more ago. I think Mark's intellectual honesty in tracking the ups and downs of the various systems he's developed, sharing how his ideas have changed over time, and engaging with this community that's formed around his ideas, has been extraordinary.<br><br>I don't demand he write another book -- jeez, he wrote three great ones and provides a free web site. My guess is that he's using one of his systems, and if a new book becomes a priority, then he'll work on it in little-and-often fashion until he feels he doesn't need to and will then move on to the next thing on the list.</div>

<div class="content">^ No :)<br><br>This system is his Final Version. It is his last and ultimate one. If this does not warrant a great productivity book, which he already said that he will write "soon" a year ago, then I don't know what will.<br><br>This event deserves a book. He wants to write a FV book. And we want to read that new book soon.<br><br>Mark, where areth thou? :D</div>

<div class="content">"which he already said that he will write "soon" a year ago"<br><br>He also said that we would have to wait until the book was released to learn the Final Version from the book itself.  Instead, he generously released the rules early and for free, and it works great.  I appreciate this and think we can afford to be patient with regards to the book.  There are plenty of good ideas on the blog and in previous books.</div>

<div class="content">"If all else fails, what do you think changed in Mark's thoughts on productivity since the DIT book?"<br><br>There have been some interesting recent ideas with regards to urgency:<br><br><a href="../blog/Urgency the natural way to prioritize.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2012/1/26/urgency-the-natural-way-to-prioritize.html</a><br>(I just noticed, but it's interesting that he spells "prioritize" the American way.)<br><br><a href="../blog/Methods I don't recommend (revisited).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2012/2/23/methods-i-dont-recommend-revisited.html</a></div>
