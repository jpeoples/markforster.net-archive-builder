<div class="content">I started a new AF2 list yesterday.  I am on holiday from work just now and started my list on a lazy Sunday, so it is very early days, but so far I think I like the changes to AF in version 2.  My question is regarding the handling of recurring items and is actually equally relevant to AF1.  A 'home' example from my list yesterday would be 'laundry'.  A similar 'work' example for many people would be 'email'.  It's one of those jobs which is never really finished, so it always needs to be on the list.  Normally, with items which you've worked on but haven't finished, you would cross the item off the list and re-enter it at the end.  I did some laundry yesterday but in several blocks over the course of the day - after you've loaded and started the washing machine, you have to wait before you can hang up the washing to dry!  (Sorry to pick such a trivial example, but there are work activities which are similar in nature and having clean clothes is important!)  There seemed little point in crossing out and re-entering 'laundry' several times in one day so I waited until I knew I wasn't going to do any more that day before I crossed it out and re-entered it at the end of the list.<br><br>What do you think is the best way to handle these sorts of items?  Is it best to cross them out and re-enter them every time you leave that activity to go and do something else, or is it best to do it once you've finished working on it for the day?  With the new dismissal rules in AF2, I can see that crossing out and re-entering every time helps to break up chunks of 'not done' items, which could be under threat of dismissal.<br><br>Look forward to hearing your response.</div>

<div class="content">Jill:<br><br>I think you have to use your own discretion here and do whatever works best for you. If I'm virtually automatically going to do Stage 2 then I wouldn't bother to write it again. If I'm likely to forget it or get carried away by other thing, then I would.<br><br>I certainly wouldn't decide on the basis of breaking up chunks of tasks. The whole point of the dismissal procedure is to give you an incentive to go more often towards the beginning of the list. So if you break everything up at the end of the list you will lose much of the incentive.</div>

<div class="content">Just back from vacation - delighted with AF2 and started it today - big THANK YOU Mark<br><br>Repeating items:<br><br>For some months now in AF1 I have had my own private notation for repeatig items. I enclose the item in curly brackets with a note at the end for the frequency [d, w, m etc] or else the next occurance [wed, 17.00, bedtime, etc]  for the item like this - <br><br>{generate client invoices} m<br>{exercise dogs} d<br>{next batch of laundry} x<br>{go swimming twice per week} wed<br><br>If there is no specific 'next time' then I just use an 'x'<br><br>Whenever I cross off an item in curly brackets I automatically re-enter it at the end of the list for the next occurance. After 6 months of AF1 about 20% of my active items had such brackets and the system was comfortable, adaptable and very flexible.<br><br>I know that I could have put many of these items into my calendar - but I found that some items, by their nature, dont do well when tied to a specific time - being on the AF list gives them a better chance of getting done.<br><br>Paul<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Paul - yes, I certainly see how AF could deal with recurring or fuzzy tasks, but I wonder how the monthly tasks are handled. They would be hanging around for a long time, and may be under threat of dismissal.<br><br>Any idea how you could deal with something like that?<br><br>I like the idea of putting short turn around recurring tasks in the AF list, and I some times use that technique for repetitive items like reading a book (Eg - page 24/150 pages read, last read on June 29th). <br><br>But monthly items like paying bills, or preparing next months budget - those things go into an electronic tickler software.</div>

<div class="content">Paul:<br><br>My own feeling is that tasks which recur less than every couple of days should be put into some form of reminder. The reminder should be the trigger to put the task back on the list.<br><br>The main reason for this is that is likely to be a long way back from the end page, and therefore may escape being given the urgency that it merits. If there is a weekly reminder it will go back on the end of the list and should get done quickly.</div>
