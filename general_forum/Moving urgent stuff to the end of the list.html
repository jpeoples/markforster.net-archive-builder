<div class="content">Has anyone tried this after doing a morning scan? Does it help? Does it sacrifice the integrity of the system?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jeff<br><br>The general advice is not to do this - it does impact the integrity of the system in that the system is designed in such a way to allow your intuition to act on what is genuinely important.  By transferring items you are effectively rationally determining importance rather than allowing your intuition the best chance.<br><br>You may find some of the early discussions on items standing out and rational vs intuition in the FAQ's post to be helpful.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br></div>

<div class="content">If urgent I just write it in again.  Three benefits ensue:<br><br>1. Likely to get done sooner if in reverse mode<br>2. Likely to get done sooner since on list twice<br>3. I like it when I've done it and get to cross off the duplicate for free<br><br></div>

<div class="content">If something is really urgent, I will put it on my calendar as an All Day Event.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jeff, <br><br>It might not be something you want to do *all* the time.  I think it depends in part on how long your list is - if you've got 20 pages and you've let some things go long enough that they've become urgent and they're buried in your list, then it might be best to move it.  If you only have a few pages, those items should stand out without you having to move them to the end.   I think some people just tag them with some kind of symbol to make them stand out - which is really no different than moving them.  I doubt that your whole system will implode if you do it once in awhile.  Try it - that's the only way you'll see if it works better or not.<br></div>

<div class="content">Jeff,<br><br>I don't move it to the end, though I've thought about it.  I copy it to a "high priority" index card and work that before I work the AF list.</div>

<div class="content">I would scan and move things to the end when I first started with AF1 back in January.  But once I came to "trust the system", I found I didn't need to do it anymore.  <br><br>As a "backup", I would still create Outlook reminders for some important things with hard deadlines, but AF would usually take care of them just fine.<br><br>With RAF it's even better -- those urgent things are handled much more quickly and efficiently.<br><br>So, personally, I'd try to avoid "tweaks" like this, and just let the system do its thing. <br><br>Sometimes I can't remember whether an item is already on my list or not.  In those cases I just add it again at the end.  Maybe that creates a duplicate -- but it doesn't seem to have any adverse impact.</div>

<div class="content"><<MOVING URGENT STUFF TO THE END OF THE LIST<br><br>Has anyone tried this after doing a morning scan? Does it help? >><br><br>I tried this and found it an interesting experience, because I could almost feel the steam leaking from the system after only a few days. The power of AF gets lost if one moves tasks - I don't know why, but it happens.<br><br>So, I don't do it anymore. Its better to stick to the rule that you have to at least "touch" a task in order to get it to the end of the list. This rule seems to be the main engine of AF.<br><br>BTW, the same effect happens on a smaller scale if one re-enters a dismissed task just by copying the words. Just this morning I had to dismiss a couple of tasks that all have been dismissed before and re-entered after review. One has to think about *why* a task was not appealing enough and write it down in another way. Or, vice-versa, trying to say it in another way is likely to enforce a re-thinking.</div>
