<div class="content">Is there any way to read all the posts by one commentator?<br><br>I am impressed by some of  Seraphim's and Mark's responses and created forum posts and have bookmarked them.<br><br>I wish to read all of their forum posts since the inception of the forum.</div>

<div class="content">Wow, that would be a lot of reading!  :-)   My first post here was on more than 10 years ago!  And there are many others who still post actively, who were here many years before I was!<br><br>There are a LOT of great discussions on this site. Whenever I do a search, I always come across some interesting gem from that past. Nobody can match Mark's succinct wisdom, but there are so many other insightful and interesting contributors here. The first year or two after the introduction of AF1 especially cover a very wide range of time management and productivity topics.<br><br>But to answer your question, I don't know of any way to search for posts by a particular user. Maybe Mark has an answer.</div>

<div class="content">You could use the Google site search function. Since I can't put the actual text of what you need to put into the Google search box, here's what you do. <br><br>In the Google search box, type site:  (the word "site" followed by a colon)<br><br>Type/paste in the URL of Mark's forum, with no space between the colon and the "h" of the address<br><br>Then put a space followed by the name of the  person whose posts who want to read.</div>

<div class="content">Ebb:<br><br>It's not a complete collection of all posts and comments, but here's an index of all forum threads created by Seraphim: <a href="http://andreasmaurer.net/public/posts/by/seraphim/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://andreasmaurer.net/public/posts/by/seraphim/</a></div>

<div class="content">Wow, I am not quite sure how to respond to this! I am really happy my writing has been helpful! But also a little scared - now I have a reputation to live up to!  Thank you for the very kind words! :-)<br><br>And Andreas, thanks for that compilation! It made me realize I’ve been pondering many of the same fundamental problems for a very long time! It’s very helpful for me personally, to see how my thinking has evolved over time - and what has stayed the same.</div>
