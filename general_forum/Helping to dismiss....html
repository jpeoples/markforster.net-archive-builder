<div class="content">It would be helpful if there were 2-3 questions, or a statement, that one could read/recite to help dismiss items - with clarity, and peace of mind. <br><br>Anyone doing this already?<br><br>Inspired from Mark's most recent post:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/6/13/autofocus-a-closer-look-at-dismissal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/6/13/autofocus-a-closer-look-at-dismissal.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br>But the whole point is that you don't need to answer any questions. You dismiss tasks solely on the criteria that no tasks have stood out for you on the page.<br><br>It's only after you've dismissed the tasks that you start asking the questions - which are all given in the blog post which you've provided the link for.</div>
