<div class="content">In the past there has been discussion of how things come to "stand out" as ready to be done.  (My preferred phrasing for this is that a task "grabs me", it really does kind of sit up and say "I'm ready!  Do me now!")  I thought an example my illustrate for folks for whom this is still an issue.<br><br>I was working on the "home" side of my book a little bit ago - folding and putting away laundry.  As I did this, I found my thoughts drawn more and more to a particularly resisted task that I knew to be on the next page (changing a car rental reservation).  Clearly this was my mind telling me it was ready to deal with the phone-menu nightmare of changing this reservation, so when I was finished with the laundry I simply came down and did it.  All resistance was GONE.  Sure, it wasn't FUN to do, but it didn't take nearly as long as I had feared, and best of all - now I don't have to worry about it anymore!<br><br>Obviously this is an extreme example, but I find the normal process to be quite similar.  I read through my list and nearly always I find that my eyes will keep coming back to one particular task on the current page.  That is the task that is ready to be done.  This is the part of the system that I was most skeptical of in the beginning - I loved the "little and often" aspect as well as the not evaluating aspect, but i wasn't sure how the "standing out" process would work.  I still don't know HOW it works, but I do know that it DOES work.</div>

<div class="content"><<I still don't know HOW it works, but I do know that it DOES work. >> <br>That's so true Sarah - and the fact is that it is not just the "nice" tasks that stand out.  I'm actually a bit miffed that a few of the leisure items I put in just WON'T stand out!</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>That's a great story about overcoming procrastination. And how long did the<br>actual phone call take? Probably no more than 10 or 15 minutes which<br>is much less than all the time you spent worrying about it!<br><br>Well done!<br><br></div>
