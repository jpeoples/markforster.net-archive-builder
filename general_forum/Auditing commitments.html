<div class="content">It's impossible to use time effectively when you are doing too much. All your activity gets divided over long periods of time - or - all your time gets unequally assigned to some activity to the neglect of others. The latter case is fine exactly when the overlooked items weren't critical. Still, too many of those will interfere with finding and doing the good stuff. <br><br>The best system in the world can't solve the problem of doing too much, unless its solution is to get you doing less.  But whether the system decides or you do, auditing (and accepting the conclusions) is a necessary aspect of success.</div>

<div class="content">DWM did a pretty good job of automatically forcing you to limit your commitments without requiring you to do an explicit audit.</div>
