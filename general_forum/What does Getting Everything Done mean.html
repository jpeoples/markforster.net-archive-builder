<div class="content">What does "Getting Everything Done" mean?<br><br>What on earth could this possibly mean?  Based on Mark's writings and / or your own experience, what does this mean?<br><br>I'll think on this and maybe post something when AF suggests so.</div>

<div class="content">First, great question Norman, I never paused to give it a thought until you posted this.  I think the "Get Everything Done" quotation is a challenge-not only to get all of your tasks, goals, objectives done, but also consciously parring off items from your workload that are unnecessary or reordering your life.  Will you be able to come up with a 1,000 item list and get done with it due to Mark's systems?  Probably not if you're time constrained on the tasks.  But that's not really what Mark is promising with the quotation.<br><br>So let me revise the quotation to how I think of it:<br>"Get everything important done"<br><br>The brilliance is that Mark does not resort to the customary A, B, C priority system, but has created systems that bust that mold.  <br><br>I will write more on this later, but it's a start.</div>

<div class="content">I think it refers to what Mark has said often, that you either commit to doing something or you don't.  Priorities are irrelevant.  If you said you'd do it, then do it.  Me, I'm partially convinced.  <br><br>I think there is also a category of things that you choose to do but is never done.  "Watch birds".  If that's your commitment, you could watch birds for one hour in your lifetime.  Or 8 hours a day for your lifetime.  In the latter case are you never done watching birds.<br><br>There is also a huge category of maybes.  "Read Paradise Lost" might never get done and that's fine.  I suppose those aren't part of Mark's everything.<br><br>Finally I think there is a category of things you commit to, but the commitment is for later.  This is a tough one, because you can say "Chop down tree" is less important than other things on this list.  But the open question is, when will it be the most important thing.  If you say never, then you really aren't going to chop down that tree.  In response Mark says decide whether you'll do it or not.</div>

<div class="content">And still have time to play. Almost everybody complains of not having enough time in a day.      I do too. What's the solution?</div>

<div class="content">Post tornado drill thoughts:<br><br>This thread might give me an opportunity to straighten out some thoughts that seemed to get tangled in a couple earlier threads. The ostensible 50 post limit might be unfortunate, since I find brief entries probably the easiest write and most intelligible to others.<br><br>I think the most provocative word in the phrase has to be "everything". Getting a hold of this "everything", I believe could be pretty helpful in understanding what is meant by standing out.<br><br>"Getting" also is interesting, especially if we hear in the word the uncommon meaning we might assign to it. Rather than hearing "getting" as part of the verbal phrase "getting done" (someone just in here with the technical grammatical description (my memory fails me)), if we hear its meaning as "to receive", I think this might be interesting.<br><br>"Done" is a bit more of a leap and can only make sense in light of the other two.<br><br>To be sure, I do not believe this phrase could possibly mean that we somehow can get everything done or everything important to us.<br><br>In short, and perhaps this can be drawn out, I would re-phrase it (off the top of my head): Receiving and responding more carefully to what the world wants us to do.<br><br>That would make for some shoddy marketing.</div>

<div class="content">Norm, <br><br>"What the world wants us to do" I think is a phrase peculiar to your way of thinking.  I think of the world as an inert object without any wants.  Most people in the world don't really care what you do either.  So that leaves "what people connected to you want of you" and "what you want".  So do you mean acknowledging people's wishes and your own?<br><br>My other guess is that "what the world wants" refers to situations, events, opportunities, ideas, and not *really* about sentient desires at all.  In that case I suppose you mean to evaluate those by what "stands out".  Is this what you mean?<br><br>(My bet is you meant something else.) <br><br>I think 'get' here means "Make it happen".  (Although it could mean "receive", I see no reason to take it that way here.)  It's only about the transition from "everything not done" to "everything done".  So the questions are:<br>What is included in "everything"?,  and <br>When is everything considered "done"?</div>

<div class="content">In his book "Do It Tomorrow" Mark Forster writes what he means with "getting everything done" , esp. at pages 153-154, Completing the day's work. <br>Unfortunately I lack the motivation to type up those two pages. <br>Go and buy the book.</div>

<div class="content">Per DIT:<br>"Everything" is the concept of one day's work (in the case of DIT, usually done the next day).<br>"Done" means no backlogs.</div>

<div class="content">Some personal responses:<br><br>A sense of ease and spaciousness.<br><br>Space and time to have an idea.<br>Space and time to do "nothing." To reflect, to perceive, to follow one's nose.<br>Space and time to dream and laugh.<br><br>Current with deadlines and commitments. Able to help others because one is not drowning. Able to say "yes" and follow through or to say "no" without guilt.<br><br>No festering piles of neglected tasks. (Some things may be accruing but they are accruing with the comfort of knowing that they will be attended to "in turn" when the time is ripe.)<br><br>Real and consistent progress on important initiatives, even (especially) those not driven by external deadlines.<br><br>A sense of satisfaction in what one accomplished today and eagerness to work again tomorrow.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, that seems to be a workable definition in the context of DIT, but what about AutoFocus?<br><br>Liz, that sounds like a very attractive definition, meaning I'm highly motivated to get there because it sounds marvelous.</div>

<div class="content">From the title, "Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play," "Everything" catches the eye but the hidden promise in the title is "Still."<br><br>I could get everything done and be unhappy. I could get everything done and burn out. <br><br>But as Mark wrote in one of his many articles, it's the second part of the title that prevents me from adding a negative ending to the first part of the phrase. Yes, we want to get everything done, but not at the cost of everything else in our lives.<br><br>So, I can get Everything done that is important to me, yet stil have a sense of lightness and playfulness about life. I get to play because I got all the important work done.<br><br>Digression: the idea about getting the world's work done. To play off of the Constructive Living thread, David Reynolds said in an interview that "I'm the universe's way of getting the universe's work done." That "work" can be whatever my purpose is at the moment: picking up littler, writing a story, taking a nap. Harmonizing the work/rest or yin/yang so we can be most effective.<br><br>Enough of my woo-woo talk for this evening!</div>
