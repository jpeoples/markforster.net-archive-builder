<div class="content">Is it really a contour map? With major contour lines every fourh minor contour lines?<br>Is it of an actual hilly/montainous area? Scottish highlands perhaps?<br>A mapper dabbling in GMM, OSM, 4SQ and other mapping projects, here. :-)</div>

<div class="content">sabre23t:<br><br>Well spotted!<br><br>It's actually a contour map of the traditional site of Mount Sinai, where according to the Bible God gave the 10 Commandments to Moses, with the area immediately around it. The low plain to the left of the Mount is where the episode of the Golden Calf took place. St Catherine's monastery is in the valley running above the Mount. <br><br>It's a bit difficult to follow because it's tiled and repeated several times, but if you look it up on Google Earth you'll be able to work it out.</div>

<div class="content">Mmm ... Is it here <a href="http://g.co/maps/zdnca" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://g.co/maps/zdnca</a> on Google Maps? The contour doesn't look too similar. But may be Google's contours at too coarse.</div>

<div class="content">You need to turn it so that NNE is at the top of the map and zoom out a bit. The bit entitled "St Catherine" on the map is not the monastery but the local village. The monastery is called "Monastery Guest House" on Google, though it's in fact the entire monastery.</div>

<div class="content"><a href="http://www.4sqmap.com/search#/28.538146289732147,33.97398485455324" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.4sqmap.com/search#/28.538146289732147,33.97398485455324</a> shows a "Burning Bush" venue near the monastery. Is that https://foursquare.com/v/burning-bush/4ecf5a4899114b4886dfacc8 at the right location?</div>

<div class="content">For some reason the maps aren't showing up in your links, so I can't tell where they say it is. However the Burning Bush is not separate from the Monastery. It's actually within the Monastery enclosure.<br><br><a href="http://uk.memphistours.com/Egypt/files/large/106781609_The%20Burning%20Bush%20inside%20Monastery%20of%20St.%20Catherine.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://uk.memphistours.com/Egypt/files/large/106781609_The%20Burning%20Bush%20inside%20Monastery%20of%20St.%20Catherine.jpg</a></div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark. I just read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Mount_Sinai" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Mount_Sinai</a> about Mount Serbal, Mount Catherine and Jabal Musa/Mount Sinai. I believe you meant the latter by "traditional site of Mount Sinai" as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai</a> .</div>
