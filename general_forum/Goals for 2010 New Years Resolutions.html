<div class="content">Just wondering if anybody else is reviewing at their goals or New Years Resolutions in the upcoming holiday break.   <br><br>It's my favourite time of year for reviewing this stuff because of the time away from work, usually at home with my loved ones and friends, so I find I focus more on those kinds of goals rather than work issues.<br><br>I also like doing it on my birthday as I'm more aware of the passage of time.</div>

<div class="content">I usually do this on Rosh Hoshanah (Jewish New Year). This year, I used a PDF (which I'm having trouble finding online) entitled "A Good Year" by Marcus Buckingham. If you'd like it, provide an email and I'll send it to you. <br><br>My goals for 5770 (or 2009-2010):<br>i. Self-produced album by May 2010 <br>ii. X # clients by Nov 2009 <br>iii. Repair rotator cuff injury<br>iv. Some form of weekly Jewish study group</div>

<div class="content">Good post! My goal for 2010 is to be more organised and to have some sort of list a la DIT - perhaps have a 'master' list and write down things as they come up as my memory is not great.<br><br>Also a good tip mentioned in DiT I will try to rememeber is if you are interrupted, to write the interruption down and continue doing what you have been doing - that way you are not jumping arond from one thing to another which is VERY stressful - I am guilty of that and of 'living in my head' - it is easy to become overwhelmed. I am also guilty of checking my emails FAR too often so at the end of the day I have 'cherry picked' at lots of things but not completed anything major.</div>

<div class="content">For starters - <br>- I'm going to work on this maintenance procrastination and get to the bottom of it.  I think AF in some form will be a good way to deal with it.  I'm getting the mindshift and understanding of the reasons behind it, which I never had before.<br>- finish the reno and sell the house - by June 30, 2010<br>- stop living so far below my means and restrict my savings to 10% of NI, ok maybe 20% - no more of this aiming for 80% nonsense<br>- stick to my eating approach and see where it takes me<br>- continue decluttering (part of maintenance procrastination)<br>- stay in touch with BFF's regularly<br><br>avrum, I had a rotator cuff injury too years ago and it's a hard one to heal.   I wish you luck - and patience!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Norman. <br><br>Unfortunately, my RC problem has morphed into Frozen Shoulder syndrome (as diagnosed by a sports med doc). I've got many months, if not a year or two, of painful physio ahead :(<br><br>Again, thanks for the info.</div>

<div class="content">Nick,<br><br>In the literature that place to write down "interruptions" is called a "grass catcher".  For some years I've always kept a small notebook dedicated to that purpose open beside me to catch the grass that gets in my way.  Periodically, I go through and clean it out, moving items wherever they should be.  Just, FWIW.</div>

<div class="content">Mike - thanks! I like the name 'grass catcher'! I can't tell you how many times a day I get sidetracked by people interrupting - also my mind wanders terribly, checking email, distracted by clutter on my desk and piles of paper, I resolve to have a grass catcher on my desk and see what happens!<br><br>BTW what is a rotator cuff? Good luck with the physio Avrum and hope it heals well.</div>
