<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">In our discussions here on the forums and on the blog I noticed that Seraphim posts a lot of links to all sorts of topics. This suggests a well maintained database of web bookmarks.<br><br>How do you do it? Seraphim specially but everybody else as well. How do you keep your web bookmarks in order and well usable?<br><br>Any tips?<br><br>(I mean method, not software tools.)</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>It's not really possible to separate the method from the tool.<br><br>I clip everything I might want to refer to again into Evernote. I tend to clip rather than just bookmark because the internet is a transient medium and stuff disappears off it. I have over 10,000 notes, all of which are easily findable through keywords and search.<br><br>These notes range from a few words to entire books. Plus loads of photos and an art gallery selection.<br><br>On the rare occasions I want to find something I haven't got in Evernote, I search my browsing data history.</div>

<div class="content">I find that sorting by keyword alone becomes a problem with bigger databases. Let's say I save five pages from this site and file them under time-management. So far so good, but at 500 items under that heading that becomes a problem.<br><br>How should these keywords best be managed? Maybe a hierarchy of keywords?</div>

<div class="content">I also use Evernote to save things -- it really is easy to clip text and images from websites. <br><br>(However, see <a href="../general_forum/Evernote disaster.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2776414</a> )<br><br>Also, one trick for URLs for this site -- if you want to link to a specific comment (not just the main post), find some likely-unique phrase in the text of the comment, and search in the Search This Site box, using full quotes. This will give you a link to the exact comment.<br><br>For example, this is the link to this page:<br><a href="../general_forum/Web Bookmarks.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2776270</a><br><br>But this is the link to my specific comment here:<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2776270#post2776415" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2776270#post2776415</a></div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, are you seriously telling me that all those wonderful links all these years came from you crawling this site when doing your posting?<br><br>(That would indeed be a productivity problem!)<br><br>Meanwhile I stumbled upon this discussion on Hacker News:<br><br><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25073574" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25073574</a><br><br>Yeah, I guess no more bookmarks for me. It's either an open tab or a "notes file" of some sort that may contain hyperlinks or not…<br><br>It's still a work in progress though.</div>

<div class="content">LOL I guess I am pretty fast with search - whether searching this site or searching my Evernote files.<br><br>There is a side advantage of searching this site for some specific post I want to link: discovering all kinds of interesting old blog posts and discussions that I had completely forgotten about. :-)</div>
