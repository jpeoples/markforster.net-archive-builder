<div class="content">Hello,<br>I'm just in the process of switching from GTD to DIT and so far I really love my new system. The question I have is that as a salesman, when I put in my task diary to call a certain prospect(s) today and I make the calls but never get to actually speak with them, do I just keep re-writing them down for the next day and so on? Or, do I put a reminder in the next days task diary to "follow up " on yesterdays unreachable prospects? These prospect calls are not "date Specific" as they are "cold" calls. WIth GTD I would just write the names & #'s of the prospects on my @calls list, and then highlight in yellow once reached or completed. Any thoughts are appreciated! Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">Dear Mitch<br><br>I suggest you use whatever system you find works best for you. If the GTD system you describe works fine, then continue to use it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mitch<br><br>I'm in also in sales.  I have all my Prospects on a spreadsheet with various info, contact details, log, etc.  <br><br>To prompt me to do the work, I have "Prospect Calls" on my weekday "Will do" list.  <br><br>This reminds me (in the unlikely event that I should forget!) to scan the spreadsheet every day for calls that need making. <br><br>I also have "Update prospect spreadsheet" on the same daily list as a reminder to update the spreadsheet last thing with any new information that I have as a result of the calls.<br><br>I used the same system when I was using GTD.<br><br>I think this is what Mark means, use the same system. <br><br>In other words Integrate your existing prospecting system in to DIT.  It's pointless creating more work by duplicating an existing list just so everything is in the task diary.<br><br>I have a target of 15/20 meaningfull calls to make a day amongst my other tasks, unless I am travelling.  When I complete this number of calls, I consider that "will do" task finished.<br><br>Hope you find this helpful and switching to DIT as beneficial as I have.<br><br>Cheers<br>Steve</div>
