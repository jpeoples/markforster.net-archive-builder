<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I have seen again your video and i found it so clear and so interesting now i begin to know the system. <br><br>Bytheway you speak such a such a good English with a precise vocabulary that it is perfectly understandable even for a French like me ! The way you speak and explain reminds me my youth when 25 years ago i was at Hereford in a vicare family. So thanks for yours explanations and this video. <br><br>The interviewer was also perfectly clear. <br><br>Anyway watching it, i was thinking that if your are ready to show us your new way or alternative using autofocus it would be great having a new video for it so clear with a film and it's so interesting watching you dealing with the system. <br><br>And if you need a French translation of AF2 i shall be honored to do it for you. <br><br>Jupiter</div>

<div class="content">I normally only "lurk" on these discussion fora, rather than post.  But I too am eager to see the details of the new system Mark is working on.  Should I be checking the site every day (as at present) or is an announcement not that imminent?  At any rate I hope Mark will not wait until a video can be made!  <br><br>I am struck by the range of tweaks people have come up with to deal with urgent items, and in the meantime will be experimenting with some of these.</div>
