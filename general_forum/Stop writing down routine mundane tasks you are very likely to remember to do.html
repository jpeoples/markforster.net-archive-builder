<div class="content">Last night I returned from a short business trip, and had seven unactioned tasks "above the line" (still using Real Autofocus [RA]). It was late and I was tired, so I deleted five, reentered one (against the rules), and deferred one.  To my amazement, my list now had only one item! <br><br>This morning I managed to do all my routine stuff without writing them down, as I was in a hurry for the train and still a bit jet-lagged. I didn't forget anything important. Typically, I would enter 10-15 morning-prep tasks, or run through a checklist. <br><br>So I'm wondering if it might be good mental exercise *not* to write everything down. Will it really cause more stress or prevent flow? Will I miss the frequent feeling of reward from not having something dotted then crossed off?<br><br>I'm going to experiment with only adding items I deem necessary, such as<br><br>• a creative idea I don't want to forget<br>• a critical small task that would "blow up" if forgotten<br>• main project tasks <br>• other tasks/routines that I want to record being done<br><br>The last two aren't absolutely necessary, as I'm likely to do them anyway. But my RA list does capture daily activity, and I sometimes look back on the crossed-off pages to recall when I was working on something. I don't note the actual date/time when I do a task, but the RA rules ensure that everything dotted and done happens within a 48-hour window, so my dated start-of-day divider lines provide the approximate time. The RA list serves as both an activity log and a reminder system, but I don't really need to log routine and small stuff.<br><br>Comments?</div>

<div class="content">There are pseudo routine items that only appear to be routine items because they are constantly re-entered into the list. I stopped re-entring them. For example: read rss-feeds, empty physical inbox, vacuum the office room, catch up on various social media accounts, etc etc pp<br><br>I only re-enter those in the list when I catch myself thinking "mhm, I really should vacuum this room " or some such.<br><br>Also, I've found my life to be a clear division between "working the list" and "not working the list", when I am not working the list, I nevertheless accomplish some routines. For example kitchen chores, these all happen routinely in combination with using the kitchen, like lunch breaks. Or reading books in the evening, is just something I do (routinely).<br><br>Yes, there is an art to it. Do I put "brush teeth" on the list? Probably not, but where does it start?<br><br>The better you use your Autofocus-type of list, the clearer these boundaries become. But they seem to be constantly fluid as well.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher, <br><br>I like the idea of being off-list but still engaged in getting things done, and will follow your suggestions.<br><br>Do you dot the next logical task before going off-list? I plan to do that. I use a pencil, so I can erase the dot if circumstances change.</div>

<div class="content"><<Will it really cause more stress or prevent flow? Will I miss the frequent feeling of reward from not having something dotted then crossed off?>><br><br>In Dr. David Schnarch's "Passionate Marriage", he encourages readers to approach the theory/exercises in his book with an open (but critical) mind. He suggests, if they don't work, to continue your search for something that better suits your principles and life circumstances. <br><br>I have found most productivity authors, coaches, and yes, therapists are too hyperbolic in their predictions and stated consequences of not following their systems. <br><br>David Allen can repeat the phrase "mind like water" all he wants. I found classical GTD caused more stress than it relieved.</div>

<div class="content">The principle I've always recommended is if it helps you to have it on the list have it on the list and if it doesn't don't.<br><br>That of course will vary from person to person.</div>

<div class="content">I do better with them on the list. Things that have been habits or routines or part of a batch for months often silently drop. I often use a weekly grid for my routine tasks, but equally often realize on Wednesday that I haven't made the grid, or haven't checked things off, or want to choose just a few things to focus on.<br><br>I even have a list of things to do before bed, stuck to my mirror. Brushing my teeth has been a firm habit for decades. My mouth just feels wrong if I go to bed without brushing, so I do everything on the list first. Even so, I often forget to read it! I need to rewrite it occasionally, to keep it fresh, and ask the tough questions about the things I'm not doing.</div>
