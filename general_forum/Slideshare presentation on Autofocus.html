<div class="content">I created a Slideshare Presentation to explain the system to my friends.<br><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/charles_in_oz/auto-focus-1543619" rel="nofollow">http://www.slideshare.net/charles_in_oz/auto-focus-1543619</a><br><br>Mark, I made it very clear that the system is YOUR work and not mine, and my presentation clearly states it is the story of my implementation. I trust that the restating of the rules and use of book covers and your image (from your web site) is fair use.<br><br>Charles<br></div>

<div class="content">Charles - loved the presentation. And your explanation of how you quantify productivity is interesting. Very helpful. <br><br>One point... I think the intuition really needs to be highlighted when "selling" this system to others. It is the one element, IMHO, that really sets this apart from all others.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, thanks for your feedback. Someone else said the same thing. I need a slide that says "How does this system work?" and as you said, INTUITION is the answer.<br>I think the idea of the desire to close a list (complete a page) comes into play.<br><br>I will await further feedback and make an updated version.<br><br>Charles<br></div>

<div class="content">Well done Charles, it is a clear way of demonstrating Autofocus.<br><br>Perhaps mention that 'dismissing' items doesn't mean they are dismissed forever, just 'for now', you can always go back to them later if necessary?<br><br>I enjoyed watching it, many thanks for the reminder of how we should be doing it in its basic form.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I was laconic but really liked it and would repeat others appreciation. <br>Have you participated in GTD's groups before?</div>

<div class="content">Charles:<br><br>Two points:<br><br>1) I note in the slides that you seem to be using three highlighting colours (orange, green and violet), but you only mention two colours in the instructions. What's the significance of the three colours - or are orange and violet intended to be the same colour? In which case maybe it would be less confusing if you redid the slides with a consistent colour throughout.<br><br>2) If I want to keep track of the date on which an item has been completed, instead of writing the date after the item, I write the day only in the left-hand margin (e.g. I would write an 8 for today June 8th). It's only necessary to write the month as well if the item is over a month old. Having them lined up in the left-hand margin makes it far quicker to compare and extract dates - and you can also insert today's date very quickly at the end of the day against all tasks completed that day, rather than have to remember to do it for each individual item as you complete it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thanks for your comments.   Good point about the highlight colour.<br>The orange and violet should be the same. I must have used a different<br>highlight pen at the office.  I will rescan some new pages for the<br>update to the presentation.<br><br>Thank you for the suggestion about writing the dates on the left hand side.<br>Most practical!<br><br>Charles<br></div>
