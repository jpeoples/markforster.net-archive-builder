<div class="content">Best wishes to all. I wish you Love, happyness and success for 2011 !<br><br>About 3 weeks ago I went back to my old love ie Omnifocus. <br>I needed to follow my projects but also I wanted to keep my intuitive AF but not on paper because I have a lot of appointment outside and I soon gonna have an ipad. <br><br>I wondered how I could make contexts. I found this way. <br><br>I created :<br> AF LIST<br>UNFINISHED LIST<br>DISSMISS<br>ERRANDS<br>RECURRING TASKS<br>SOMEDAY MAY BE<br>NOTES <br>PERSONNAL<br><br>I dont know yet how this will work in the future but for the present time I improoved my efficiency and won quiet a lot of time per day. <br><br>When happen time of working I just use OF with AF4R rules and it is fast. <br><br>Does anyone has adapted Omnifocus for Autofocus ?<br>How ? <br>And How do you do it ? <br>What are tour tips ?</div>

<div class="content">Hello Best wishes to all ! <br><br>I complete a bit my topic about Omnifocus to show you how I did this morning. <br><br>1. I completed my project list on .page where i put my bigs rocks<br>My page is divided in <br>- Unfinished<br>- Short term<br>- Long term <br>- Someday may be<br><br>2. For my AF tasks, I just copy and past the all aF list on a new page and draw a line at the end. So everything old is on the top and everything new is after the line <br><br>3. I will clean and add on  OF  my task after work and do a little review of my project<br>It wont take long. <br><br>Of course I could work on OF. But I noticed that reporting my stuff on a single page increased my intuition and made me dismiss thing much faster. <br><br>The advantage I see on the system is the great following of my projects and an easy treatment of my tasks. <br><br>I will report how the system is updating.</div>

<div class="content">Forget point 2 and 3 I kept all on OF, reporting was too complicated. <br>Instead I reported my new tasks and did a fast daily review on OF it took me 10 mn<br><br>this morning I flagged the tasks i want to do and now I begin my work. <br><br>I added a new project folder call Quater objectives where i put my main quater objectives as they come to me. I noticed I came back a few time yesterday to this folder just to see if my bigs rocks were on the flow.</div>

<div class="content">I think i got it. Omnifocus is almost perfect. Today I have hardly worked and did not spent any time with organization at all. <br><br>Instead I just let open my computer and read my tasks like i used to on paper. <br><br>The unfinished list is great. It make me focus on the most important things. The AF list is on control. I don't use dismiss a lot instead i erase or report little by little. <br><br>Anyway there is something which still remains. I love reporting some tasks and my bigs rocks at night and draw a line at the end. It's like a starter for the next day. <br><br>I gona report how it becomes.</div>

<div class="content">What a busy day ! I did 10 important tasks and all was under control. <br><br>Today's actions :<br><br>about my note book tasks<br>The AF4 List I wrote yesterday night is now unreadable. There is nothing left except some notes which could be somewhere else. . <br>The unfinished list is wonderful it make me focus on my bigs rock during the day. <br><br>About Omnifocus<br>During the day I looked sometime on my af list (fastly) but most of the time on my unfinished list and my call and mac list. I erased Dismiss for it was unusefull. If some thing can't be done i report it in the future or i erase it or i put it on the someday context list. <br><br>For tonight. <br>I close the list on my note book draw a line and throw on paper every tasks and ideas wich comes on my mind. This will be my tomorrow list. I put the big rocks in the marge like I did yesterday. It helped me a lot today. I take my historical note book and report all the most important things which happened today. <br><br>Tomorrow morning  I will read all my AF list (what is left) and report on OF the tasks needed to be followed in the future. Then I will report from AF after a little review the most important or urgent tasks i ought to do, like i did yesterday on my paper note book. T<br><br>Then I will report tomorrow night on this forum how it becomes.</div>

<div class="content">This is the end of the week.<br><br>I noticed the unfinished paper list was indeed fantastic because it made me focus on my most important things. I finally reported the most important bigs rocks projects to stay focus on them and just in a word between parenthesis<br><br>I noticed the daily AF was great and there was some day such as today where i wrote about 2 new A4 pages of tasks. <br><br>I noticed my following of future tasks and project made me focus on the big plan of my tasks and helped me to see my dead line, to do things and to collect in a whole system all was in my mind. <br><br>I gona do my weekly review no and plan the bigs next week rocks. <br><br>I noticed there was no reactions about my topic. I just wonder if you were interested or not by this topic. If you are just tell me. If there is no answer I won't follow this topic next week. <br><br>Good we to all.</div>

<div class="content">I finish my weekly journal about using Omnifocus and autofocus on a note book. Ie mixing 2 solution a paper and a digital. <br><br>The weekly review of all my projects took me only 45 mn (for about a 100 of projects)<br>The flagging of tasks I intend ou will intend to do on monday took me only 10 mn <br>I have now a perfect view of what is worth to work on or not and my bigs rocks are planed. <br><br>Finally I keep from AF the method, the "context" as explained at the top of this topic and the MF way ie  the "double reading". <br><br>Working on a digital solution has also another advantage. As I am on mobile me, I am ready for my omnifocus ipad solution I will have on february (for my birthday. So I wil be operational everywhere and I will have a copy of my database in case of crash. <br><br>I still use my paper notebook but as a warehouse where each night after my daily review I drop all I have to do, let it grow and do my best to advance on topic as the day advance, and clean it at the end of the day with one aim : nothing left in the list !<br><br>I found a great advantage with this system. Dismiss is automatic and I only put in my omnifocus software nothing but what has a real meaning for now or in the future.<br><br>The system is for the moment interesting and fast.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Jupiter,<br><br>I'm a longtime mostly lurker on this forum.  I have read your posts, including this one, with interest.  Happy New Year to you and to everybody on this wonderful forum!<br><br>I, too, have gone back from paper to OmniFocus.  The reason is that paper was becoming too cumbersome and unfocused.  Of course, any digital solution can also do the same.<br><br>Just like you, I have found the double reading to be important onscreen.  Other things that help me stay on track are flagging a small subset of things to work on (à la 3T) and making sure that I keep my computer desktop free of clutter and don't collect too many open browser windows with "open loops" of stuff that I'm interested in but haven't decided what to do with.<br><br>For organizing my tasks in OF, I have a few projects and contexts.  I'm not fussy about creating a new project for everything that has multiple steps, as GTD would require.  Thank heaven for Mark Forster's various systems, which have helped me to simplify and only complicate where absolutely necessary.  I only have contexts for things that I need to see a separate list for, for example, errands.  (That list I use in OF on my iPod Touch when I'm out.)<br><br>To display my task list, I group and sort in Context mode by Date added.  This gives me a list somewhat like DWM, with separate groups for tasks added today, this week, within the month, and longer.  Any tasks in the last group are ripe for dismissal.  I work those subgroups sort of like AF4R.  <br><br>Thanks for giving me the prod to write up my system.  I hope it's coherent.  <br><br>Cheers,<br>Lenore</div>

<div class="content">Just a note on the many browser windows thing.<br><br>I struggled a long time with that because one online research goes to the next and before you know it, you have about 15 windows/tabs about the various "loose ends" of you research. It's kind of a mind map where you want to read all the boundary nodes but you really don't have to. The problem is, you don't know where the center of your research is so you test the boundaries this way.<br><br>I also happen to just be interested in a totally different thing while I'm searching for a specifc thing. The remedy to my problem was to use "Instapaper":<br><a href="http://www.instapaper.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.instapaper.com/</a><br><br>You basically register but you don't even have to put a password to register!<br>And you drag a button to your browser bookmarks bar.<br>When you get to a page you might want to read but is not in your direct field of focus, you just click that bookmark and it saves the link to the page on Instapaper. You can then peruse your findings after the event leaving you focused when you have to and flirting with knowledge when you want to ;)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter - very interesting posts; I admire how dedicated you are to finding a system that suits you perfectly.  I'm intrigued by the various electronic implementations that forum contributors discuss, and it's interesting that some people use a mix of electronic and paper.  I've only ever tried the paper version and I love its simplicity.</div>

<div class="content">Hi All thanks for yours contributions and encouragements. I was thinking that no one was interested by this post. So it gives me a little courage to go on my experiments. <br><br>Your remember, last week i reported a 21 tasks to do for today from OF <br>This morning at 9 am I reported 9 others tasks coming from OF and my spirit and THEN began the day full of phone calls, struggles and rush about everything. <br><br>Today was a hard day. I had a lot of phone calls and things to do. <br>Once i realized that i could not do everything I decided to focus on one subjects and to all the tasks about it. I tried to do the MIT business tasks ie the ons which can bring me some money first and do all administrative tasks at a time where i was less efficient ie 13 am. <br>As the day was really hot i took another piece of paper divided it in half vertically and reported from the previous AF list the mit tasks I add to do : right urgencies and left hot autofocus tasks but with all tasks grouped by subjects and I wrotes my notes where I could. <br><br>Now the day is finished and I noticed I have done the most important things of the day. There are a lot of dissmiss. I have a lot to follow in the future. <br>So I do now my little daily review and cross all what mus be everywhere paper notes, <br><br>omnifocus, autofocus list and so on. I will report later how I improoved the system <br><br>Oh I forgot something, I mad a lot of check list on omnifocus. <br>Principle, <br>notebook<br>Omnifocus<br>Current initiative  (this comes from DIT) <br>Daily review<br>weekly review<br>Tools <br><br>They help me to stay focus.</div>
