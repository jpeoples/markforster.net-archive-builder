<div class="content">Yes I wonder how he is doing too. <br>I sent him an email to two different addresses but I didn't get a response and he hasn't responded to the threat asking about him. I think it's safe to assume that he has more important things to attend to right now that require his attention whatever they may be. I find it remarkable how for so many years he has commented on so many posts on the most minute points of procedure. <br><br>For this month I am exploring some different methods. For many years I kept a long list and I have posted about it but I'm getting older and the rapid scanning of many pages is getting hard on my eyesight.</div>

<div class="content">So I am using checklists for routines in the morning and at noon today and at night time. Also I am using a no list where I write down what I need to do for the next hour or so. I'm using a blank index card 5x8 and attaching it to a clipboard of that size. That seems to be working out well. There are usually some items that I don't get to. Usually I throw the card away. All of this reduces greatly the number of pages I use. However it is not so great for working on projects. It handles mostly routine items. I have tried to to vote one page for each project. With some success. <br>I do check back to this forum everyday but if I have been commenting a lot I feel like it will be better for me to wait for others to post.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your interest in my well-being. My silence has been due to to being severely ill with MDS (Myelodysplastic syndromes). I think I am supposed to be dead now but am still struggling on. <br><br>I've found your discussions very interesting - so keep it up!</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I’m really sorry to hear this news.<br><br>It’s always interesting to read what others are doing with their systems on this site, but I genuinely miss your thinking and tinkering. I often refer to you as the artist of productivity - your approach has always stood out as more creative, more nuanced. Almost spiritual.</div>

<div class="content">Good to hear from you again Mark and best wishes for your health.<br><br>I must have been following this blog and your books now for about 15 years or more. This is a large chunk of my professional career, and you had a major impact on how I approach my work.</div>
