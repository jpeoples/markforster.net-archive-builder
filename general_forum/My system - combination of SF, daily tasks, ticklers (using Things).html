<div class="content">For those interested, I would like to share my system. It is first system after my years-long experimentation, with which I am really satisfied and productive. It uses combination of three sections - daily tasks, ticklers, superfocus. I use Things for Mac, which I honestly recommend after testing tens of apps for both Win and Mac. But it can be easily implemented on paper or other app also. <br><br>See screenshots for better understanding:<br><br>daily tasks - <a href="http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/1968/dailytasks.png" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/1968/dailytasks.png</a><br>week focus - <a href="http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6836/dailytasksweekfocusexpa.png" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6836/dailytasksweekfocusexpa.png</a><br>inbox/last page in superfocus - <a href="http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/3855/inboxsuperfocuslastopen.png" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/3855/inboxsuperfocuslastopen.png</a><br>superfocus/active page - <a href="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/2735/superfocusactivepage.png" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/2735/superfocusactivepage.png</a><br>ticklers - <a href="http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4171/ticklers.png" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4171/ticklers.png</a><br><br>1) Daily tasks (Things: Today view) - tasks I would like to do today. I include here not necessarily classical important/urgent tasks (which goes typically to superfocus), but tasks which I would like to focus on today from any reason; also daily chores, repetitive and little tasks and memos etc. Typically, there are not more than 10-15 tasks here, which I continually remove, add and change as day runs. <br><br>Visually, I split daily tasks into several sections (see screenshots): <br><br>(a) ROW - most current tasks (horizons of minutes and tens of minutes), which I want to focus on precisely now. I do not use this section always, only when there are more current tasks, when I have distracted attention or when I want to do many things at once. Name it "ADHD aid" or "working memory" - as you want :-). At other times, this section is empty. <br>(b) OTHER DAILY TASKS - which I sometimes ad-hoc visually group by any context or characteristic which is useful. Sometimes I have only one bunch, sometimes I have more groups of tasks - e.g. tasks to do when on the walk, tasks connected with Project A, household routine tasks etc.  <br>(c) SCHEDULED - tasks, which is best to do in some specific day time, but are not so time sensitive like appointments. E.g.  "buy bread" (when going home from work), or "visit my friend" (in late afternoon, app. between 17 and 20). I put these tasks in visual order from earliest to latest (I do not specify the time, it is obvious for me). When reviewing, I just look at the first task in the row and when it is still not time for it, I am sure that I do not have to check/do all the other tasks in the section. Sometimes there are 3-5 tasks in SCHEDULED section, sometimes only one or none, depending on the day. And of course, when necessary I can move task from SCHEDULED or grouped daily tasks to ROW section to do it now or schedule it in a moment... <br>(d) DISTRACTIONS - section for quick braindump - when not sure whether the idea is valuable enough to be added as a new task to superfocus or everything what comes to my mind when I do not want to be distracted during current focused activity. <br>(e) WEEK FOCUS = only one task (holding this name) - all week goals are added as notes of this task. Clicking on this task expands notes section, allowing me to review them, but also to hide them so as not to be distracted during the day (see screenshot).<br><br>2) Ticklers (Things: Scheduled): All tasks (a) scheduled for specific future day, (b) to review/decide/remember on specific future day (c) to force myself to do on that day etc. Very suitable also for repeating tasks, household/maintenance tasks etc. Ticklers for today are automatically moved to Daily tasks by Things.<br><br>3) Superfocus (Things: Projects) - for majority of my tasks. Superfocus pages are made by Projects in Things (AF1, AF2, AF3...), with only exception of last (open) suprefocus page, for which I use Inbox. When there are 23 tasks in Inbox, I move them to new SF page/project and start again with empty Inbox. Tasks which belongs to superfocus "second column" (C2) are tagged by triangle symbol on the given page/project. The page I am currently working on is marked with ">" prefix. When at least one C1 task is done, I change the prefix to ">>" (meaning that I can move to next page if nothings stand out). I adhere to most SF rules, with several exceptions: (1) I do not move unfinished task to C2, but usually to last page (Inbox in Things) = I add only urgent/focus tasks in C2. (2) I try to work on all C2 tasks before moving to next page, but in some cases (not suitable time/context/mood) also not - I move them to next page as C2 without working on them, (3) because the system is electronic, I do not apply rules for dismissal when both columns are full, nevertheless I try to limit number of C2 tasks.<br><br>Working in superfocus: When I work on task, I mark it by "NOW" tag. When finished my work on it, I either delete it or move it to last page (Inbox) or define next task/step (also in last page/Inbox). Unfinished C2 tasks are of course moved to next page. I have special tag for tasks which are open (started and needed to be checked/continued later but I am not actively working on them at the moment - e.g. downloading big files to computer, washing laundry). When I have such task tagged in current page and I want to move to next page, I move them also to next page like C2 tasks.<br><br>Using the system: In the morning - quick review of calendar, today tasks (which are moved from ticklers automatically), review of week focus and nearest ticklers -> defining new daily tasks + grouping them to sections above. Working during the day - alternating Today view (daily tasks) and Project view (superfocus) and working on both types of tasks, trying to push as many activities as possible to superfocus section.<br><br>I am sorry for the length of my description. This system works swiftly, it is not as complicated as it may seems from this long story :-). I will appreciate your comments/questions.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Daneb.<br>This looks simple and effective.<br><br>The way you create "pages" in batches of 23 might work for email too. I.e., when the Inbox reaches N items, move them into a new email folder to process as a closed AF page. That is especially attractive to me, because though I really prefer a paper system for my tasks, I am forced to use an electronic system for my email!<br><br>(Well, not *forced*, but who wants to hand-copy all their emails?)</div>

<div class="content">Bernie, yes - speaking about the paper system, especially when I saw photos of AF pages of those with nice handwriting. I would love to use it for my tasks and tried it many times. But I have so ugly handwriting + I cannot stand looking on clutter of many crossed out tasks - and I realized I prefer nice looking lists... So I am using electronic. With combination with Things iPhone app it works. Some things (adding, switching on) takes longer than on paper, however the clarity of list is more important for me.<br><br>Using AF for emails - yes, when you have really lots of emails, it can work. Good idea!</div>
