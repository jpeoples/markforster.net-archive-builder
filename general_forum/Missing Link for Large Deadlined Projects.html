<div class="content">At present,the following discussion will only be helpful to IPhone users, but I'm wondering if there is a web-based app that's comparable? <br><br>The only significant problem I have with AF is with large, deadlined projects. For example, if I have a video editing project intermixed with little, non-urgent tasks on my list like clean windows, the risk is I will spend only a little time on the video project while I am flitting about getting other tasks done. Meanwhile, the deadline approaches which necessitates a big chunk of time set aside last minute to get the video done. It isn't that I don't know the deadline is approaching and it isn't that I haven't done any work on it at all. The problem is I seldom think about how much total time the project will take with respect to the number of days until deadline. <br><br>I've read here so many times to trust the system with these things and use your calendar. I have the deadlines indicated and the system is actually trustworthy in getting me to START on these large projects, but it isn't preventing the sense of uneasiness I have about completing them--especially since I've still had to drop everything to get many of these projects done on time. Even time-blocking wouldn't be effective for me in this case, because I don't know how much time to set aside--especially because I have more than one of these kinds of projects going at a time.<br><br>I found an iPhone app called DoThisNow. I was worried it was going to be like LifeBalance which isn't as concerned with deadlines as it is balance. I also worried that it would require me to enter a project's importance. I have no idea of a given project's importance relative to many others! Fortunately, DoThisNow only asks you for the number of hours you can reasonably devote to working these types of tasks a day, the number of days you work a week, the number of hours you expect each project to take, and the deadline. You also set a general buffer for all tasks/projects that accommodates the unexpected.<br><br>DoThisNow then gives you a list of what to work on today and how many minutes you should spend on each task/project. I really love the slider that allows you to indicate your progress. The work periods indicated could easily be entered into the Action Machine or used for time blocking or egg timing your day. I plan to use this approach for my large deadlined projects in conjunction with my standard AF list and I'll report on how it works.

<div class="content">To express a planned effort on AF I use a hack based on the pomodoro technique:<br>I use 'X' to mark a time unit when done, '_' to indicate a planned effort<br>- Maw grass X X _ _<br>- Project A _ _ _ _ _<br><br>As I am lazy I don't rewrite little-and-often tasks as long as they are close to the last page, this also helps my visual memory to keep things in one location. My grass-field is large and I consider 4 parts when working on it, but in other cases a time unit stands for 25'<br><br>Recent posts proposed to set the deadline prior to the mark when appropriate<br>28/5 - Project A  X _ _ _ _ <br>        - Task 203<br><br>My grass-field is only a distant relative to English examples. It has moles, rabbit holes, moss, wild flowers, etc. and even some grass.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>Do This First looks really interesting - looking forward to hearing more from you about your actual experience with it.<br><br>Does anybody know of any software or service similar to that on Windows or the Web?<br></div>

<div class="content">Joshua, my first look for another non-IPhone program like this came up pretty empty. Toodledo can tell you what to do given your task length, priorities, and due dates if you tell it how much time you have to work. But it doesn't give you a progress report and a daily work allotment. You could set up a goal with subtasks to see progress, but all of that it so much work compared to what DoThisNow offers. <br><br>The only other option I see so far is Skoach. This program schedules time blocks for you. Again, this is much more complex as it needs to know everything else you're doing in a day. I also don't like that it tells you exactly when to do something. This might be a great niche for a developer! I hope if someone finds something comparable, they'll let us know.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>Thank you for getting back to me.  My search has so far left me empty as well.  The only software I had been able to find along these lines was TimeTo (<a href="http://www.davidberman.com/software/timeto.php)" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidberman.com/software/timeto.php)</a> which seems to be somewhat similar to Skoatch in philosophy (not look and feel!).  <br><br>I have contacted the developer of Do This First, and he told me that they are a) working on a web version and b) planning to port the app to Windows, Win Mobile, and Mac as well.  Sounds promising, I would say. :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Joshua, that is fantastic that they plan more versions! So far I couldn't be more thrilled. Of course I need to wait for the newness factor to wear off but this software has really helped me get real about my big projects and what I can and cannot commit to. I have none of the "I should be doing something else" stress that has plagued me for so long. AF handles everything else. I will check in after more time with it and will hope that the developers have more versions first on their list. LOL</div>
