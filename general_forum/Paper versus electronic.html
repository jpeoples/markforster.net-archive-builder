<div class="content">Some here (not me) seem to like Evernote; others prefer paper.  <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2012/05/07/evernote-acquires-penultimate/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.evernote.com/2012/05/07/evernote-acquires-penultimate/</a> may be a way to get the best of both worlds.</div>

<div class="content">Ahh ... Handwriting on Evernote.<br><br>I'm FV'ing on Evernote Windows/Android. But I prefer typing/swyping. My handwriting is atrocious. I have a hard time reading my notes after more than a week or two. :-}</div>

<div class="content">Interesting, but I think that handwriting is not the biggest reason why people prefer paper. E.g. I now use both paper calendar and paper FV. I use Mac for almost everything else - I am typing maybe three times quicker than I am handwriting. But the reasons why I switched back to paper is: quickness in "opening" the app/page, quickness in writing down new task/date or editing it, which in electronic version usually means opening + locating + changing + saving... Moreover, I can have the paper page of tasks/dates still in my view on the table, no new "window" or app covers them.<br><br>I did not believe how big is time difference in such simple operations between paper and electronic version. But several times I needed to agree on a date with my friend, who uses paper (I used iPhone calendar). He had already written down everything, when I just started to locate the right day. And I am definitely not the slowest iP/mac user... So I returned back to paper (after cca 5 years of being strictly electronic) - realizing that for me being simple is sometimes better.</div>

<div class="content">Regarding the general "Paper versus electronic", I use both to their strength ... <br>* A4 folder to A7 notes paper -- Shirt-pocket-portable, quick-scribble-capture, cheap, disposable.<br>* Evernote Android SGS2 -- Belt-holster-portable, slightly-less-quick-swype-capture, cloud-sync, editable-searcheable, long-term-archiving.<br><br><<  I switched back to paper is: quickness in "opening" the app/page ... opening + locating + changing + saving >><br><br>My SGS2 with Evernote comes close to the A7 paper. Takeout from holster + Switch on + Unlock screen + Home screen + Tap Evernote + Tap New Note + Swype along + Tap Done. <br><br><< I can have the paper page of tasks/dates still in my view on the table, no new "window" or app covers them >><br><br>Using my Evernote Windows with additional 20" LCD screen connected to my notebook, alleviates this "apps covering" problem. Evernote tasks on my smaller notebook screen. Main apps on additional LCD screen. When I have to work with more than 2 apps, I sometimes work the FV tasks directly from my Evernote Android screen. Quite transparent moving from Evernote Windows to Android because of its cloud sync.<br><br>Another technique of leveraging paper/electronic strengths is to use the phone camera on SGS2 to capture/archive whatever you've scribbled/sketched on paper. I mostly captured scribbles/sketchs on whiteboards with the camera. Notes on the A7 paper I usually re-enter by swyping rather than using the camera.</div>

<div class="content">While I agree with those who say that writing imprints tasks better in the brain - I believe Mark offered this view in his first book - I don't like carrying notebooks, whereas a phone is always with me for quick capture of tasks. A sheet of paper works better than a notebook for me, but I always end up leaving it somewhere and can't find it when I need it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: One of your initial posts illustrating the FV showed pages from a loose leaf notebook (many were guessing about what the "dots" were for). The notebook looked very nice and appeared to be leather. What kind (brand?) of notebook was it and where can you buy them?<br><br>Marshall<br>May 10, 2012 at 4:33 | Unregistered Commentermarshall spradling</div>
