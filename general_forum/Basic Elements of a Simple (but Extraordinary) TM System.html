<div class="content">I think it would be valuable if some could share what they consider to be the minimal elements that should be included in a workable system.<br><br>After trying out a lot of methods based on my previous trial and error exercises, and from comments on this forum (especially after Seraphim came out with his "AutoDIT"), I came up with eight elements that I believe that everybody has to deal with in their daily lives. (In addition to the normal to-do list, or active AF pages).<br><br>I believe that these elements (or 'types') of tasks are dealt with by everybody regardless if they have a system or not, and regardless if they are on a conscious or subliminal level.  Therefore, I think that they all should be addressed.<br><br>These eight elements are:<br><br>1)  Actives<br>2)  New (capture)<br>3)  Day Plan ("What do I have to do today?")<br>4)  Tomorrow (must-do's + "can't get to today")<br>5)  Routine/Checklist (Everybody has to do routine things from time to time.)<br>6)  Scheduled items (anything in the future)<br>7)  Project tasks (anything that requires multiple tasks to accomplish)<br>8)  Backlogged items (undone, to be re-evaluated, clutter)<br><br>The thing that I find personally to be paramount is the Actives Page; THE place to put ONLY items that you are actually working on.<br><br>Once I realised these basics, all of a sudden my system became more simplified and workable, and I quit trying to complicate things. <br><br>Incidentally, to give credit, I think that what prompted me to finally simplify my system came from reading a response from Alan to me in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1649349#post1651684" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1649349#post1651684</a> .  In one short paragraph, he listed every one of the points stated above (except for "tomorrow").</div>

<div class="content">BKK:<br><br>My problem with the list as given is that the different elements are arrived at by different criteria. You have time-based ones, state-of-play based ones and project (and non-project) based ones. At first glance this would seem to introduce an unnecessary degree of complication.</div>

<div class="content">I concur with Mark's sentiment, but in practice I agree with BKK.  other than tomorrow, what can be dropped?  Active is essential. <br><br>Scheduled and recurring go together. <br>Day Plan and Active go together (" today?")<br>Project tasks are essential for keeping organized.<br>Backlogged items arent desired, but they happen.</div>

<div class="content">If we're into dividing tasks up at all (which I'm not entirely happy with), then I would have thought that there are several well-established ways by which it can be done which are shorter than BKK's suggested list and probably just as effective.<br><br>Must be done<br>Should be done<br>Could be done<br><br>Important and Urgent<br>Important and Non-Urgent<br>Urgent but not Important<br>Not Urgent and not important<br><br>Immediate<br>Same day<br>Everything else<br><br>Urgent<br>Non-Urgent<br>Unfinished<br>Recurring<br>Dismissed<br><br>There are also many "sliding scale" methods, such as:<br>Degree of importance<br>Degree of resistance<br><br>Or two factors added together such as:<br>Benefit of doing this + least time required</div>

<div class="content">I have 100+ tasks.  My experience is that just going through these looking for the best things to do today is not enough.  Grouping related tasks into projects helps.  Pulling out routine items and doing those routinely helps. Taking scheduled items out helps. So its not a bout a system to handle lots of task types. It's about reducing system content so what's left can be handled effectively.</div>

<div class="content">I believe that there are, broadly speaking, three root causes of procrastination: lack of clarity, lack of motivation and anxiety.<br><br>GTD was really effective at forcing me to define work, DIT is the only system I've used so far that really helps with motivation, the Unschedule tries to tackle some of the causes of anxiety (I didn't find it wildly effective), but I'd love to try a system that dealt with all three.</div>

<div class="content">Autofocus is good at reducing anxiety.  I'm working at developing clarity by other means as I follow AF.  Motivation is already in the air.  I just need to think goals and reasons, which goes along with clarity.</div>

<div class="content">OK I'd say that all time management systems from a to-do list to AF and GTD boil down to....<br><br>1. Capturing tasks<br>2. Choosing what (or what not) to do and when<br><br>Just those two simple steps can be done in an infinite number of different ways. :-)</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-16 23:24</div>
<div class="content">Maybe you could boil it down even more:  Choosing what to do now.   All the other elements mentioned grow out of this, and are in support of this.</div>

<div class="content">smileypete:<br><br><< I suspect they have some sort of habit/routine/firefighting method (or all three?), and deal with things that are mostly 'in their face'. >><br><br>No, that's not how I understand it. I remember being on a walk with one such friend and we came to a fork in the track. I said "Shall we turn left or right?" And he said "Don't make a choice. Just walk towards the junction and when you've gone past it you will either be on the left track or the right track."<br><br>I also remember him advising someone who was trying to decide whether to move to South Africa in the near future and he said something very similar. "Don't make a choice. In a year's time you will either be in South Africa or you won't be." <br><br>I still often use that method when out walking but I've never managed to make it work for bigger decisions. But some people can and do. My friend said the essence of the method was consciously to reject making a conscious choice about anything.<br><br>Steve Jobs seems to have used very much that method in his business career at least some of the time.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with smileypete about the two main elements of any TM system.  I think one of the huge issues people have and one we have debated here is the choosing part.  I have always been more concerned with item one, which is simply forgetting that something needs to be done.<br><br>With regard to # 2  I do not think a system chooses for you.  I suppose one could create a system where you created arbitrary rules like going in order or reverse order of entry, or throwing darts.  Even people who say they don't consciously choose actually do unless someone else tells them what to do.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I tried Mark's friend's approach going home today and arrived at the gym. I ate half a banana and a sandwich for dinner.  I'm going to apply this attitude to AutoFocus and see how it goes. Specifically, I will think about things freestyle but I won't think about choosing.  I will scan my list but only do whatever I feel inclined to.</div>

<div class="content"><With regard to # 2 I do not think a system chooses for you.><br><br>Well a simple TO DO list does the choosing, you just do the next item on the list!<br><br>It seems the advantage of switching systems is starting with a fresh list.<br><br>So what could be interesting is to start a new AF1 list each week! Only add things from the old list as they come to mind, or through a quick review. Don't add anything that's unlikely to get started before the end of the week.</div>

I am not even recommending a ‘thought process’.  Like I said, “… regardless if they are on a conscious or subliminal level.”<br><br>Alan mentioned:  << I concur with Mark's sentiment, but in practice I agree with BKK. other than tomorrow, what can be dropped? Active is essential.>><br>I agree with Alan (that Active is essential).  But this a side note; this is talking about ‘a personal system’.  This is the same as a ship’s captain keeping a log.  He records every boat or helicopter that comes or goes, every course change, maintenance problems, and every significant change in the weather.  It would not be appropriate to mix in with these activities his little “wish list” for the day, the week, or whatever.<br><br>Again, having a separate Actives list is a personal choice.  However, if you do anything at all, that’s an “Active”, no matter if you write it down or not, no matter if it on a list or not; it’s an “Element”.<br><br>Regarding Alan’s “other than tomorrow”, that also refers to a particular system.  However, regarding elements, there are always going to be things that have adverse consequences if they are not done today because of distractions or simply due to the fact that there are not enough hours in the day.  Therefore, they really need to be done “tomorrow”, or the negative consequences will be even greater.<br>  <br>If they can’t be done tomorrow, well, that means that they will just have to be some other time, therefore, they will be done in the “future”, or will be “scheduled”. <br> <br>More from Alan:<br><< Scheduled and recurring go together.>>   Sounds reasonable.<br> <br><<Day Plan and Active go together (" today?")>>  <br>Personal choice.  Again, regarding “elements”, and not a particular system, everybody has some sort of idea what they need to do today – even if they don’t really think about it and write nothing down.<br><<Project tasks are essential for keeping organized.>><br>Definitely.  Even if you just have to fix a leak problem in the loo, there may be several steps that have to be taken to fix it.  Without any project organisation, you may find a step on page 5 that actually is a prerequisite to something on page 11.  However, even if you don’t write anything down, we all have things to do that require steps – and not all of these steps may be evident the first time you think about what all has to be done to accomplish the project.<br><<Backlogged items arent desired, but they happen.>>  <br>Everybody is going to have things that are “undone” (not started).  This is definitely a basic “element”.  How you manage your outstanding items is (again) a personal choice regarding your personal system.<br><br>Mark wrote:  << If we're into dividing tasks up at all (which I'm not entirely happy with), then I would have thought that there are several well-established ways…>><br><br>I was not referring to would-haves, should-haves, could-haves, etc.<br> I was referring to: <br> - What are you doing right now? <br> - What do you want to do?<br> - When do you want to do it?<br> - Is it something I need to do on a regular basis?<br> - Are there multiple steps involved?<br><br>Alan wrote:  << Autofocus is good at reducing anxiety.>><br>Now, that’s an understatement (smiley face goes here).  <br><br>Mark wrote:  << I've known people who have made a point of never choosing what to do but just letting it happen.>><br>That can backfire on you big time, e.g., something really important that should have been completed by 17.00 hrs., YESTERDAY.<br><br>Mark also quoted:  <<"Don't make a choice. In a year's time you will either be in South Africa or you won't be.">><br>Maybe if sitting down and writing out a list of the pros and cons of going to S.A. had been a basic “element,” then maybe his/her whole career, family, health and future would have benefited for the better.<br><br>I was not referring to something that can be broken into “an infinite number of ways”.  Nor was it supposed to be a list of categories to aid in the process of “choosing” items to work on at the moment.  Even though sitting down and writing a list of pros and cons about going to S.A. is a “choice”, if your personal system is modeled on basic elements (i.e., not too complicated), then just maybe the item would have been more likely to stand out and get done.<br><br>Of course, most of my personal trials have been based directly on comments and suggestions in this forum.  Human nature and perfectionism (whatever you want to call it) seem to always get in the way and one tends to unnecessarily complicate things. <br> <br>The problem is that we don’t necessarily know that we have developed a too-complicated personal system until we realise that we are not really using it (or using it effectively) anymore.<br>  <br>We want a system that works, and consistently, period.  (That’s why we are here.)<br><br>Therefore, my attempted “contribution” to this forum was to share the fact that I was finding myself with too many tweaks.  Even using a pure AF system according to the rules, the basic elements I described above apply, in my opinion. <br>  <br>So, what I found myself doing was trying out too many things.  I feel that sticking with the basic elements forces me to keep it simple.<br>  <br>I did not model my choice of basic elements by the post by Alan that I referred to in my original post above.  However, I was shocked when I went back and re-read his post, because his choices of ‘basic elements’ basically mirrored mine after I had wasted so much time with superfluous aspects in my personal systems.  This is my point.<br><br>The hope is that one can simplify their personal system by combining these elements or using one or more of them as stand-alones.  For example (until the book comes out), we can use pure AF or SF with all of Mark’s rules and suggestions, but decide to have scheduled and project tasks separately.  Simple, but the basic elements are still there.</div>

And more how we could group all this by project too. <br><br>I red one time a book written by H Mac Cormack. It was a great manual about succeeding in business. He spoke about organization and explained how he did. At the end of his explanation he said that he did not know any successfull business man who has no system of organization. <br><br>For my self I red GTD and use a lot AF but my real problem is still about the way to do it. For David Allen life is complicated then we have to use complicated system. For Mark Forster if I rightly understand his philosophy, organization must be simple. For me I still don't know. This is were my problem is.... Sadly.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps you've heard this story before: <br><br>Back in the early 1900′s, Charles Schwab was the head of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Consultant Ivy Lee offered to increase the productivity of Schwab’s people, and he would let Schwab decide what the results were worth. Schwab agreed.<br><br>Lee taught each executive to sit down at the end of each day, and create a list. The list must contain only the six most important things to be completed the next day. Each morning, they should start the day by working on the first item on that list, and not move on until it is completed.<br><br>As the story goes, Schwab initally balked at Lee's suggested method.  Didn't you need to account for unplanned things that pop up?  What about setting larger goals, beyond the scope of the next day?  How could such a simplistic thing increase anyone's productivity?  To Schwab's incredulous objections, Lee famously replied, "Sir, if you haven't the discipline to do this method, then no other more complicated scheme will work for you."<br><br>After a few months of seeing results, Schwab sent a check to Lee for $25,000. That’s about $500,000 in today’s dollars. <br><br>Now I don't mean to make a plug for the 6 MIT method, rather I mean to highlight the discipline.  I personally define discipline as a self-imposed habit that provides some desired result in one's life.  It's not what you do, it's why you do it - over and over and over.  Even Mark's friend practiced the discipline of not choosing what to do.  I think the above story highlights (for me at least) that the system doesn't matter nearly as much as the discipline does.  <br><br>I also bring this up because, as a new DIT user, I'm finding that DIT has been engendering in me some basic disciplines that I feel I've been lacking.  Disciplines such as making a habit of planning - but not too far, breaking down large tasks into reasonably achievable pieces, percieving tasks as commitments, making good on my commintments in a timely manner, and being honest with myself about what I can and cannot reasonably commit to.  Of all Mark's systems, DIT is the most difficult for me to use, but I find that this is because the system requires these disciplines to operate well.  Disciplines that I had not developed as well as perhaps I should have.  For this reason, I continue to stick with DIT, hoping to engender in myself these disciplines.  So far, so good.  I've gotten one audit under my belt, and I find myself curiously motivated to avoid having to do a second.  (not so curious really, it had a similar flavor to David Allen's weekly review - very uncomfortable).  The most important difference between GTD's weekly review, and DIT's audit is that you can avoid DIT's audit if you can make effective commitments and stay on top of them.  In GTD, it doesn't matter if you're disciplined about making and keeping commitments or not.  You have to pull your tee - I mean review your system once a week regardless.<br><br>Now to Mark's friend, I recall a chinese proverb, "If you haven't decided where you are going, you'll wind up where you are heading."  If you don't mind winding up just anywhere (@Alan - was it okay with you that you wound up at the gym instead of your home?) then I'm sure that philosophy will be your bread and butter.  But really, I don't care to try it.  I've got places I want to go in life.<br><br>Finally, I'd just like to say that choosing a system is like choosing a major:  <a href="http://xkcd.com/1052/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://xkcd.com/1052/</a></div>

<div class="content">You picked an interesting thread to resurrect.  It was fine (even good) going to the gym then but I don't believe in the practice of not making conscious choices. It's certainly a low stress way to live (if nothing goes wrong) but it can lead to stagnation.  If I don't make certain efforts towards difficult goals, then habit will lead me to never reach those goals.<br><br>I agree discipline is very valuable to that end, but part of discipline is process. The 6 tasks guy was right in that a low-complexity discipline is better than a complete lack of structure. I still strongly agree with BKK's position on the subject of a simple but complete system for self-management. Such if successfully applied is very effective.  So I agree with Schwab that there is more to management, but Lee's point overrides: a simplistic system done well is better than a complex system done poorly.</div>
