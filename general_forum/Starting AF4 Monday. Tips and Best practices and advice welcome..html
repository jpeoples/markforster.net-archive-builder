<div class="content">I've been doing GTD for a while and want to try AF to see how it may help me move forward.     I'll be using AF4.  All of your tips, best practices and advice are welcome.  I will be using paper to start out and get the hang of the system, though electronic (MLO) has been my preference up to now.<br><br>So please post, and I will let you know how it goes.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Phil</div>

<div class="content">Remember you are in charge.  Sometimes people felt they were stuck because the rules "made" them stick to one section when they wished they were working elsewhere.  But actually, you are free to ignore any and all tasks you come across if you feel there may be something more important down the line.  <br><br>The only restriction on this is that you may not ignore ALL the tasks of the Backlog/Closed list.  You must choose at least one, and if you don't it's time to dismiss that list.<br><br>Doing a task does not entail finishing it; only starting it.  You'll find more instructions like this one in the AF1 rules, which are more detailed than AF4.</div>

<div class="content">I would advise using 1 notebook (I use an A5 Moleskine) with work stuff working forwards from the front and home stuff working backwards from the back. This will help you to keep the list moving steadily and avoid 'sticky' backlogs. I believe it's best to have one place for all your stuff to go into, hence one notebook. This also facilitates doing some home stuff tasks during breaks at work or when out and about for errand type tasks. <br><br>Although it might be contraindicated in the rules, I personally do find that timeboxing AF sessions helps break down the old procrastination a bit. I put the date in each morning on a seperate line. I then mark an X for 30 mins work and a / for any shorter period (which I count up as 15 mins for ease). It's then possible to track on a daily or weekly basis the average amount of time invested, which can provide useful self feedback, for example why am i so tired (lots of hours) why don't I feel I'm getting enough done? (not enough hours) etc. <br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Follow the directions as written and come back in a few *months* to see whether you need to "tweak" something.</div>

<div class="content">That's good advice actually Norman, it's best not to get into tweaks until one is used to the system</div>

<div class="content">That's great advice everyone.  Thank you. I have the same notebook Leon. I'll go with the front and back method.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Phil,<br><br>You're starting on the right track: from GTD with MLO to a manual system with paper, "to get th hang of things"  And viewing Andreas' PDF demo several times helps as well, even though it is "automated".<br><br>This comment is from someone who has been with AF since the beginning, but now settled in AF4 running in ListPro, but still with manual inputs.  How?  By following the universal advice (in this forum at least) of writing down any task or idea NOT already on the "formal" list.<br><br>I have been able to do this by experimenting/tweaking etc, but mostly using the manual/pen approach to the point where I can now trust my ListPro along with supplementary manual additions.<br><br>Alan Baljeu's response to your first post is excellent, just the first five words encapsulate it.  Alan: you have a knack of concise appreciation of what needs to be done!<br><br>If staying with manual methods in toto, I endorse the approach of one notebook and using both ends.  If you like, you can turn the notebook upside down when you start from the back, it may help with the unfamiliarity of paging "backwards".<br><br>In the end, what works for YOU is the thing that matters.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Roger</div>
