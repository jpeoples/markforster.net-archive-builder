<div class="content">For over 24 hours, Internet access here in Syria has been flaky at best and is now declining into minimal access.<br><br>I cannot access gmail/Google Mail and Internet banking and email are not possible.  <br><br>Reasons range from a problem with an undersea cable in the Mediterranean to interference by unknown persons because the Iranians are in town; as if Ahmed Dinner-Jacket hasn't caused enough trouble of late.  Downloads of the Skype application are forbidden in Syria, but existing users have been able send and receive Skype, until now.<br><br>I want to tell my wife in the UK about the problem and ask her to pass on the news to other interested folk.  Once Gill joins me on Thursday evening she will understand, Internet access anywhere hasn't been this bad for some time, even eastern Kilimanjaro dial-up was ok in 20001.<br><br>Would some kind person on this forum (I include you as well, Norman U, if you feel so inclined, copy and paste the following and send it to She-Who-Thinks-She-Must-Be-Obeyed at the following address: gmjATtoplineconsult,co.uk?<br><br>BEGINS<br><br>HML,<br><br>Internet access here continues to be bad this morning, no gmail/Google Mail (which I use as the SMTP to send email from here), no Skype, cannot retrieve email let alone send.<br><br>I've asked some kind folk on the AF/DWM Forum to copy and paste this message in an email to you.<br><br>Until I communicate with you via Skype or normal email, please call my Syrian numbers (Including the apartment telephone number in the evenings) if you need to speak to me urgently.<br><br>I'm fine, working at one of the district offices today, should be at project office tomorrow and Thursday.<br><br>Please call me quickly on my mobile so i know you've got the above message.<br><br>See you at DAM airport Thursday evening if we don't talk beforehand.<br><br>Love to family, friends and enemas,<br><br>AML,<br><br>Roger<br><br>ENDS<br><br>NB!  Will the first person to forward the above to Gill please advise in this thread so that subsequent readers do not send the email as well?  Maybe the second person can do the same so I know the email has got through.<br><br>Relax, folks, this is not a fake situation to harvest all your email addresses!<br><br>Thanking you in anticipation,<br><br>RogerJ</div>

<div class="content">Ok, Mark, even though I've forgotten what Wave is/was all about.<br><br>This is one helluva forum, a real bunch of diverse, eclectic and catholic (small c!) tastes bound by the glue of your systems and a desire to be better at task management.<br><br>I'd like to meet some of them one day on my travels, note to self: put in grass catcher, someday/maybe pages.<br><br>I do sense that the more regular members are becoming more tolerant of each other, even Norman and David, despite all the comings and comings, and rejoinings etc.<br><br>A luta continua.</div>
