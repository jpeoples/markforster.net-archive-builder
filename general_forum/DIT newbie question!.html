<div class="content">Hello All, I have a basic question about proper Do It Tomorrow technique...<br><br>When you do not finish your daily task diary entries, do you start with those first the following day? <br><br>OR <br><br>Do you start with the task diary day for that day, and THEN go BACK to the previous days uncompleted tasks?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Erik</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik, If you are in the approriate context to clear up outstanding tasks I would say it's best to get on with those tasks right after your current initiative slot (if you use it). I feel it's easier to keep things simple and on track this way.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I forgot about the Current Initiative slot. I am currently using it. I am blown away by how productive you can be if you just start with the current initiative task every day! Thank for your help Leon.</div>

<div class="content">Eric:<br><br>There's nothing laid down in DIT about what order you do tasks or what principle you use to select the order. It's really up to you to decide what fits you best. Remember you are always aiming for completion of the list, which includes tasks left over from past days.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark for the clarification. While I have your attention, I just want to say thanks for putting this material out in the world. DIT has brought a significant amount of order to my life!<br><br>Best,<br>Erik</div>
