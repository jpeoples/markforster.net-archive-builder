<div class="content">Dismissing a task should not feel bad. You did not break a commitment by deleting that task. You can always re-enter the task. You did not decide it's fate as "never done" by deleting it from the list. You did merely put the task into a test: will you come back?</div>

<div class="content">That's the scary part: Will you come back?  I know this task found its way into my list of its own accord, but if I let it go free, will I miss it?  If I remember it some time later, I can add it in again, but what if it's too late?  <br><br>At some level it's mere paranoia.  I "forget" a million things every day, referring to all the things I could possibly do but didn't because I never thought of them.  Tomorrow is a million more possibilities.  And if this task I dismissed represents a lost opportunity, it's dismissal represents time now available to act on a better opportunity.  (And it is better since it will be something I choose to do, unlike the one I dismissed.)</div>
