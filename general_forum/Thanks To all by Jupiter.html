<div class="content">Dear all,<br><br>I just wanted to tell you that i quit the forum and thank everyone for our sharing.<br>As you know i have been at the beginning of AF experimentation. <br><br>I finaly realised that what ever you use the most important thing is to work on it regularlly and do what you have to do. <br><br>No system will do the job for you. No system is perfect to. <br><br>So I just giveyou me feed back and a summery of my experiments before living :<br><br>AF came at a time where i was a lot working on paper. I had not a lot of projects. AF was interesting for me because of the recall to intuition. But working with it little by little began little by little difficult for me because i had a terrible increasement of the number of projects and i need to plan each of them, think about them and make them advance. <br><br>SO GTD was better for me. <br><br>Anyway, AF was much better on action. It replaced contexts. And for a while i kept GTD and replaced GTD contexts by AF1 then 2. <br><br>GTD contexts has always been difficult for me since i realised that they only are "WHERE YOU ARE and WHAT YOU DO at a PARTICULAR TIME" <br>See about this the great video <a href="http://paulboag.posterous.com/staying-organised-with-omnifocus" rel="nofollow">http://paulboag.posterous.com/staying-organised-with-omnifocus</a> .<br><br>As i never got rid totally with Omnifocus (enven if i had to say a lot against it) I saw the software improvements and realised little by little that i could easely work with it and that i was more efficient in my way of living, thinking and working. Of course paper was still better but the software gives me a better focus in a certain focus time. <br><br>I realised too that AF1 Brought me a lot. I saw that i could extract informations from the software, repport them on a papersheet and treat them in the AF Way. <br><br>AF2 was unusefull for me because at the beginning of me experiements i have realised that i could go backard because my last tasks were there. <br><br>But the light came with the double reading. Since i learned how to use it i did it for all. I still do it when i read my tasks on omnifocus and i must admit that i use this double reading for the reading of all tasks where ever they are. <br><br>For the future I will still reading sometime this forum but wont participate prefering working and improoving my experiments about GTD. <br><br>I am convinced that AF is perfect when you have to stay concenrate on action. But if you have to work at different levels it is hard to manage for the projects task are disseminated in the AF list. And this is really a problem for me. <br><br>At last reading this forum takes me a lot of time and it is for now much to difficult for me to handle it. I just can't do it for now. <br><br>So thank you Mark and thanks to all and best to you. <br><br>Jupiter. <br><br></div>
