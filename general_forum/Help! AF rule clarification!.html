<div class="content">Folks,<br><br>Perhaps this is in the rules but I didn't see it.<br><br>What do you do when you have a contiguous block of unactioned items that span two pages, and this is the first contiguous block? When you draw the line in the morning "after the first contiguous block of unactioned items" do you draw the line after it on page two, or do you draw the line at the bottom of page one (in the middle of the block)? Anyone see what I mean?<br><br>My intuition says to draw it at the end of the page (in the middle of the block) -- i have my theory as to why that is, but I'd just like to find out what everyone else does or would do, and if there is anything "official" regarding the situation.<br><br>Thank you very much!<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Your intuition is lying to you. :-) The line comes after page 2 because this is an open list, not a closed (page-oriented) list like AF1.<br><br>From introduction to AF2 blog comments - Mark's post:<br><br>"Unactioned block" simply means the oldest group of contiguous tasks which haven't been deleted or dismissed. If you look at your existing AF list, what is the oldest task that is still awaiting action? Is it immediately followed by another task which is awaiting action? If it's not, then it's an "unactioned block" of one task. If it's immediately followed by other tasks that are awaiting action then they form an "unactioned block" of more than one task. <br><br>I think the instructions can be misinterpreted because he says this in the AF2 instructions (capitalized letters mine):<br><br>Dismissing Tasks<br>At the beginning of each day, go to your oldest active PAGE, and draw a line after the first block of unactioned tasks (i.e. the oldest tasks that are still awaiting action). <br><br>If you were doing an electronic version of AF2, you wouldn't have any page breaks. So you would have to use p. 2 as part of the contiguous group of tasks.<br><br>Who knows, I'm probably wrong.  I often am. :-) <br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>Yes, I thought that too re: AF is an open list, and furthermore if you were using AF on a computer you wouldn't have page breaks. . . .<br><br>But THEN I realized that Forward Mode in AF does employ closed lists, pages, and that is why I intuited that the "contiguous block" must be ****truly**** contiguous (i.e. the items must by *physically* adjacent to one another on one page).<br><br>Why? Imagine the scenario where one has many pages, moves to FM, comes to the first page of unactioned items at the bottom of a page (they continue over to the next page for a few items and then there is the "review line"). If nothing feels ready to be done the first time through, one switches back to RM.<br><br>If you have a list of significant length, then FM loses some of it vigor in this situation. You can't get at those items up for review on page 2 because you can't move off of page 1, and in order to get to the items up for review in RM you have to slog through your whole list multiple times.<br><br>If the line was at the bottom of the first page the problem would be avoided. Even though you wouldn't progress to the second page in FM, at least the items on that second page wouldn't be up for review. If the items on the first page continued to feel not ready to be done throughout the day they would be reviewed, just as they ought to be.<br><br>Thoughts?<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">I've interpreted it to mean the contiguous block ends at the end of the page.  It's just too much of a bother to deal with it spanning over two (or more!) pages.<br><br>But really, I don't think it matters as long as you are consistent.</div>

<div class="content">We had this discussion with AF2, and then Mark clearly said the block could span multiple pages. I don't know if that has changed with the return of closed lists in Foward mode, but I don't think so. But as Seraphim said, it shouldn't be that much of an issue if you "tweak" the rules to have the block end at the end of the page.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Can you locate that comment from Mr. Forster for me?<br><br>I find it suggestive that in the AF rules he uses the phrase **contiguous** block instead of  continuous. Contiguous suggests to me a precision of language which would mean truly adjacent to one another. By common definition, two lines on two different pages are not contiguous, although they are continuous.<br><br>I think it is important in the sense that the rules might be more complete on this point. It does seem to make a difference if one were to mark an unactioned block after one page, or after a span of two pages. It wouldn't matter in AF2, but it certainly would in AF1. And now since AF uses the AF1 process, shouldn't it also matter for AF?<br><br>--Joseph<br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Well, I apparently really have nothing better to do ;-), so here you go: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/818889#post819022" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/818889#post819022</a><br><br>Note that, as said before, this is for AF2. Also note, that the word "contiguous" is not found in the AF2 instructions, it's only in RAF.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Andreas!<br><br>It *is* interesting that "contiguous" is used in AF and not AF2, it makes my guess more likely (that you only draw a line at the bottom of the first page when unactioned actions span two pages.)<br><br>I can see why your link conversation seems to answer the question for AF2. But, the question still remains, given that AF now comprises AF1+AF2, wouldn't the rule for AF1 supersede the rule for AF2?<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Since the dismissal rule for AF1 is not used at all in RAF, I would say no. But what do I know? :-)<br><br>Until Mark clarifies this point, it's all guesswork. Just do what works best for you.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br><<Since the dismissal rule for AF1 is not used at all in RAF, I would say no.>><br><br>You are correct that **dismissal** in AF1 is not used in AF, but the mechanics of the **dismissal rule** are.<br><br>Now, instead of the closed list of a page being dismissed when unactioned, the closed list of a page is the trigger to return to the end of the list and restart in Reverse Mode.<br><br>Say, for example, you have a 50 page list, and Page 1 has three unactioned items at the bottom and Page 2 has five unactioned items at the top. As you work the end of your list in Reverse Mode you realize that "Switch to Forward Mode" feels ready to be done (good thing too, because page 1 and 2 still have unactioned items!). When you switch to FM you scan page 1, then you go through it item by item. If none of these actions feel ready to be done then you return to RM at the end of your list.<br><br>Now, if the line drawn that morning is at the bottom of page 1, after the three contiguous items, then all is well and dandy. Those items will be put on review tomorrow, and the five items at the top of page 2 will have a line drawn under them, ripe for review. Hopefully they, or some, will be picked off when you switch to FM tomorrow.<br><br>But, if the line was drawn under the *EIGHT* continuous (and not contiguous) items spanning page 1 and page 2, then the next morning all eight items would be put on review.<br><br>Unless you worked backwards from page 50 to page 2 you wouldn't have had an opportunity to action those items.<br><br>It seems to me that if  the line is drawn after truly contiguous items, meaning the blocks don't span pages, the integrity of the system is better preserved. Otherwise the "switch to FM" rule loses its utility whenever a block spans two pages and the first portion isn't ready to be done.<br><br>Just my take.<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Well, you'd then have items on notice for review on the first active page, wouldn't you? If you do one of them, you can go to the second page and do the ones there. Of course it's possible you don't want to do any of the items on notice on the first page and really need to do something with the items on notice on the second page, but I'm not sure how often that will happen. And if they're that important, I guess you can go backwards through the list rather quickly, since other items will stop to stand out.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>Good points.<br><br><<Well, you'd then have items on notice for review on the first active page, wouldn't you? If you do one of them, you can go to the second page and do the ones there.

Or it might happen quite a bit. It is as likely to happen as not since an unactioned (continUOUS) block would appear anywhere on a list, including spanning a page break.<br><br><<And if they're that important, I guess you can go backwards through the list rather quickly, since other items will stop to stand out.>><br><br>Sure. But in that case, like I noted above, Forward Mode has lost its functionality.<br><br>The point is that it seems to me that if the rule is "draw a line after the first continuous block of uncationed items" then it is possible (probable, even, given enough time?) that you will run into this situation. It *might be* a weakness in the rules (IF the rule is such, which I'm not convinced it is).<br><br>But, if the rule is to draw a line after the first contiGUOUS block then there will never be a break down and Forward Mode will always accomplish one of the most important things that it is intended to accomplish -- letting you get a crack at everything that is on notice for review.<br><br>I, of course, don't make the rules. So it might be as you say. But, can anyone explain to me *why* there should be a rule that has this infirmity in it, when it could easily be eliminated by drawing the line only after contiguous items? The second interpretation preserves all the good aspects of the first and eliminates the problems. Doesn't it?<br><br>In the face of not knowing what the "official" rule is, why would we prefer the first interpretation over the second?<br><br>Perhaps our discussion will be fodder for Mr. Forster to issue a rule clarification.<br>--Joseph</div>
