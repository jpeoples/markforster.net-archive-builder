<div class="content">I've not been using any system to date. I've just finished reading DIT (which was amazing) and also tried out AF4 for a few days, but it seemed contradictory as I never got to the end of my open list to revisit the closed list, probably wasn't doing little & often.<br><br>Anyway after much more reading it looks as though DWM is the one for me.<br><br>I've setup a very nice little system on my iPhone with TaskPaper & TextExpander combo that mean everything works nice a quickly.<br><br>I only ever see tasks for today, +7 and +28 in my list, even though all the others are there in background. No need to pretype dates or use multiple bookmarks etc. I'll do a walkthrough here once I've proven it works in practice.<br><br>Anyway, questions before I begin:<br><br>With DWM can my entire backlog just get entered as +28 on day 1 and I let the system sort it out? Hmmm...even as I type this I think that may be the wrong approach as I would only see my backlog tasks today, then again on +7 from today, then again +28 from today. So I could get hit pretty hard. Does my logic sound right here? What approaches have you used? Keep backlog out of the system?<br><br>The view I see of my today,+7,+28 list is unsorted so tasks are shown in the order they were entered, i.e. +7 tasks are in amongst +28 tasks. Does this matter do you think? The tasks on the DWM list can be worked in any order so I guess not?<br><br>Having just finished reading DIT the thought of a "days work in day" is still very fresh in my mind and it really appealed. Can the same be said for DWM? Can I consider the today,+7,+28 closed list a days work? If that's the case then that would mean finishing all the new tasks I enter today (+28) during today which is totally contrary to DIT.<br><br>Would love to here everyones take on this as I'm very excited to get started after reading DIT but also want to make sure that DWM fits the bill.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gary</div>

<div class="content">Gary,<br><br>A word of advice: Do NOT NOT NOT enter your entire backlog into your new system.  Add a few tasks at a time.  Best to start fresh, if you can.  If not, just add maybe 5% - 10% of your backlog each day on the page one month from now.<br><br>Follow the system ... enter all tasks you enter on the page one month in the future.<br><br>No, it does not matter that when a page becomes near (less than one week) it has both one month old tasks and tasks that were just re-entered.  It does not matter at all.  You don't make any distinctions based on that ... you simply DO the task no matter what.</div>

<div class="content">I think it's a mistake (i.e., not reading the mechanics of DWM closely enough) to look only at today, today+7, and today+1M, and ignoring everything else.   DWM has you looking at EVERYTHING, from today all the way to today+1M, cycling through each group of tasks, taking action on the ones that "stand out".  Each different expiration date puts a different level of pressure on you to get the task done -- each day they creep a little closer.  Some people on this forum have called this the "about to go over the waterfall" effect or the "Space Invaders" effect.  <br><br>This is much different than tasks surfacing at today+1M, and then, if you took no action, disappearing again for three weeks till they finally appear on today+7, and then disappearing again for 6 days till they appear on Today.  <br><br>Of course you can modify and "break" the rules however you want, if you find it useful. I just wanted to make sure you were doing that deliberately, rather than simply misunderstanding Mark's instructions.</div>

<div class="content">Hi seraphim, you're right I had misunderstood the system and after Reading through it again this afternoon and the comments I now see it is today->today+1m<br><br>I'm still struggling with missing out on some of the advantages that were sold in DIT such as a days work in a day and only closed lists etc. But nothing a leap of faith won't solve.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gary</div>
