<div class="content">I am loving AF4 (I am using focuspad.ws and its iphone app) but it seems specifically geared for doing the things that we already know need to be done, or occur to us in a top-of-mind fashion for the relatively near future.<br><br>So, what about the things that we probably should be doing in order to meet our ultra-long-term goals, our life goals?  Things that we should be doing but aren't obvious?  The things that are "important" but are "not urgent".  Tools to identify the steps and the urgency to meet those goals, and even tools to come up with those goals in the first place, like to help us translate our vague feelings of need into actual goals.  What do you do/use for thins kind of stuff?  It seems like it is the just-as-important yin to AF4's yang.</div>

<div class="content">It may help to add most of the sentences in your last paragraph to your AF4 list, preceded by "Think about..." or "Identify what steps are needed to ...", and then as these elicit new ideas add them to the list.<br><br>The original philosophy of AF was to include things like the above on the list, which I find helpful, but more recently it has been advocated on this forum only to put things which are expected to be done in the short term.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">I advocate the principle to put on AF4 nothing but what is actionable. ie projects plans, project list may go apart on a special list. It's for me a question of philosophy AF4 is done for acting when you take altitude for some stuff i feel better to have a special list or folder with an executive summery of my aims. But to follow it I always write it on my AF with a sentence like "follow life goals" then i can do it on the flow as a current initiative when i feel in the mood of doing it. Hope it helps.</div>

<div class="content">I keep everything in my AF list including life goals phrased as "Think about".<br><br>I started AF on 5th January 2009. "Think about moving to a bigger house" recurred constantly on my list; I barely spent any time thinking about it, or even rewriting it as a rephrase in accordance with AF rules, I'd just refuse to let it go, crossing it out and re-entering it at intervals when it was the last uncrossed item on the page.<br><br>In December 2009, I suddenly stopped writing "Think about moving to a bigger house" and started writing more definite 'to do' statements ("call estate agent", "call mortgage people" etc). I move house on 12th January 2010.<br><br>Here's a question: would I have moved house sooner if I'd started writing definite task statements sooner? I'm inclined to think not: big life goals move at their own pace. If I'd been ready to do it back in February 2009, I'd have done it then, surely? That's the Autofocus filter in action :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Curt, you've received some really good suggestions already.<br><br>One way to determine what goals you want to go after is by using Lakein's method - there's been a lot of conversation on here about that, which you can search for.  Or just wander over to 43things.com and check out other people's goals and pick some that resonate with you.  If you use Jupiter's method, you can break them down in a separate place to identify next steps to put on your list when it stands out to be done or some other trigger like when you finish your closed list or during a weekly review session.  <br><br>One thing I'm doing this year is to take my list of 100 goals (only one big one that will take all year and about 3 that will take 6 months and some that are moving me towards bigger lifetime goals) and am trying to phrase as many of them as possible into weekly process goal items vs. outcome items (eg. lift weights 3 times / week vs. have 15 % body fat or weigh xxx).  I'm making a chart for my fridge with the weeks of the year along the top and the goals along the side.  Then I can check off whether or not I've done that item in a given week.  The remaining goals that are on my list are either scheduled (eg. trips) in some way or, like Jupiter, on a separate list that I'll review weekly (mine is in my daytimer).   <br><br>I'm a fan of the weekly review, it's the only thing in GTD or Covey that I was really good at - it's 10 or 15 minutes once a week to give to yourself to plan and dream.  I used to do it in conjunction with a goal visualization exercise from a book called "The Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness" (simple NLP stuff) which really does increase your motivation.<br><br>Here's more about that:<br><a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Mental-Toughness-by-Daniel-Teitelbaum&id=1927707" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Mental-Toughness-by-Daniel-Teitelbaum&id=1927707</a><br><br><a href="http://www.43things.com/resolutions/advice" rel="nofollow">http://www.43things.com/resolutions/advice</a><br><br>I also like Zen to Done's goal advice as well:<br><a href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/05/refresh-your-focus-every-week-to-achieve-more/" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/2007/05/refresh-your-focus-every-week-to-achieve-more/</a></div>
