<div class="content">I have posted before about declaring myself "off-list" when I want to do a task that isn't urgent or on my current active page. This helps keep me from feeling I'm failing at AF when I'm not following the rules. Procrastinators like me are often perfectionistic in their approach and so if they don't follow the rules 100%, they are likely to give up on the whole system.<br><br>For me, AF feels a lot like a board game and this is a good thing. I am often surprised by the tasks that appear on the next active page. It keeps the feeling of monotonous drudgery at bay. I had another idea for those who have a hard time sticking to the rules all the time. What if you added tasks such as, "Do any task on the next page" or "Choose any task from any page" to your list? It's kind of like a pass card in a board game. You could even add, "Do any dismissed task." I haven't tried this yet, but I plan to. I realize this is completely unnecessary for most people who are doing beautifully with AF with few pages. But for those of us who have many pages and need a little something to keep the fire burning, it might be worth a try.</div>

<div class="content">I get the same "game" feeling as you -- and like the idea of introducing even more game elements.  Although these techniques are not mentioned in the Official Description, they sound a lot like Mark's description of the playfulness of the system -- and how he's motivated to do more.<br><br>Great idea, Mel.</div>
