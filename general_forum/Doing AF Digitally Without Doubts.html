<div class="content">I have settled on using Toodledo for my AF lists (accessing it through Appigo's ToDo on the IPhone). One thing about my approach is very AF-like. I can choose how to approach my tasks, rather than feeling obligated to use pure AF. I think my approach could be very helpful to those who are waffling and having a hard time deciding if AF is for them.<br><br>Because I am using aspects of other productivity methods in my system, I no longer feel that constant uncertainty. For example, I tag all my errands with @errands. I don't always use it, but if I want to be GTD in my approach, I'm easily able to. I really like using a goal-directed approach, so I've tagged all my tasks that relate to my ten goals for the year with the appropriate goal. I like using due dates to guide me, too, so every task that has a firm deadline has that added to it. Finally, I love the feeling of accomplishment I got with DIT and other approaches. Every day I can look on my Toodledo statistics page and see how my productivity compares to previous days. I especially love that I can see if I am doing more tasks than I'm adding so my number of outstanding tasks is decreasing. I also just added a goal to work through every page a day. I didn't make it today, but Toodledo will add a link to a chain every time I do accomplish that goal. I will try to see how many days in a row I can accomplish that without breaking the chain. Adding this information takes very little time and is done as I review my tasks each evening.<br><br>Using a fuller-featured program like Toodledo for AF allows you to leave features unused, but also to begin using some of them if your circumstances change or you're just in need of a change. So often I think change is all we need to kick up our productivity. Doing AF digitally allows you to tweak the system occasionally without completely abandoning the approach. Hope that is helpful to someone.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, funny enough, I was coming to the forum to look for something on this!</div>

<div class="content">I have toyed with doing exactly this. One master list, but having at least the option to subdivide by using keywords or categories. (An excellent program for this for Mac users is TaskPaper).<br><br>So far, I've stuck with paper. But I do feel the draw of the Dark Side...<br><br>ds</div>

<div class="content">I think people should do what works for them, but I'm sticking with paper and today I was glad I did.  The school I work in had to switch out their server and we were offline for about five hours.  Now I'm not so silly that I couldn't have recreated most of my tasks on paper even if my list _had_ been online, but I was just glad it didn't mess with my system at all.</div>

<div class="content">Personally I think the difference between running AF electronically and running it on paper and pen is the difference between looking at a place on Google Earth and actually going there.<br><br>Just the ravings of a grumpy old man!</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>WOW!  That actually feels right, somehow.  I feel some kind of personal involvement with paper that I don't feel with electronic methods.  Interesting.</div>

<div class="content">Paper or electronics? This morning I lacked a  'what about project X' overview possibility with a paper list.  I can not see all the open tasks or what has been done. Going for an electronic list allows me to regroup by project or by day. Should I restart Outlook?  <br>But the Google Earth analogy stopped me cold.  <br><br>On the other hand there is nothing wrong with Google Earth,  the analogy should only work with real guy (Kipling like). I added as todo: take a look at that storm beaten beach in the Plymouth bay where we halted with our kayaks, to drink tea.  I don't drink tea. I was lost there 30+ years ago to learn some basic English as a **** **** **** **** **** **** frogy. <br><br>Damien<br></div>

<div class="content">Damien<br><br>For me the paper lists do have that sense of involvement that Mike refers to and I cannot see myself switching to a pure digital version ever (and this from a die-hard techie) but I like my digital "add-on" in One Note which serves a purpose and I still keep my project stuff digitally, whilst recording my tasks on paper.  I have no problem seeing project progress because that is defined within my project management system.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I do a nice mix: keeping the list(s) digital, but printing out the job related list every morning (the home (paper) list is being produced only on Fridays) ... this enables me to be very flexible and independent (web-based & iPhone) as well as not to miss the nice feeling of working with paper and striking out/dismissing/rewriting/-phrasing items with a pen - the digital update is done once/twice a day ... ;)<br><br>Just my 0.02 :)</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I'm still loving my digital approach to AF! I was thinking today that I am all paper when it comes to thinking and planning though. I have seen you and others refer to mind mapping software. I feel about that the way you probably feel about using software for AF. I can't imagine ever using a computer for that purpose. <br><br>Right now I am testing a DIT-like variation on AF. So far my productivity is up from pure AF, but it's only been two days. I'm going to stick with it and then I'll report on my experience. Thank you again for your kindness in sharing your wisdom with all of us. It is paying huge dividends.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps I ought to add that I love Google Earth! How else could one float calmly down the Mekong river from its source to the sea? Or fly close over the Himalayas? Or zoom in on the Kaaba in Mecca? <br><br>Fantastic!</div>

<div class="content">WAY off topic, but I took the Soarin' ride at Epcot in Disney World, Florida and using video and seats that moved like hang gliders, you really felt like you were THERE--there being California in this case. If I had such a ride in my home, I could become seriously addicted to "traveling" and would thus get nothing else done. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Just thought I'd pop this in: I got an iPod touch, and have been trying out Autofocus digitally. I love paper and pen - I agree it has a feel nothing can replace - but when using the notebook, I found I had too many tasks in one place. My assignments for the quarter (I am in naturopathic medical school) were in Things; the weekly reading list is enormous; my partner and I are raising kids; I have lots of recurring tasks; and I needed to be able to "see" them all in one list. If I have project planning one place and a task list another place and a list somewhere of what else has to be done then it doesn't work.<br><br>Why didn't I just enter them? First, I found project planning on paper is not feasible for me. Adding steps when a page is filled is a mess. Second, I have horrible handwriting. I can't read it at times. Third, there are LOTS.<br><br>So I've played with various apps on the iPod. I've enjoyed features of both ToDo and Toodledo (I found Things didn't work quite as I would like) I'd like to put in a word for the Toodledo app. It has great recurring task settings (e.g. I can put in for every two months if need be, can't do that on ToDo). I can star tasks for a "today" list. It has wonderful sorting settings. <br><br>And with a pro account, you get... subtasks. For me, this is essential. It lets me put in an entry about someone's birthday (which I can make recurring) and then make some notes about what I need to do for that - I am notorious for forgetting birthdays and sending lame cards with elephants on them. Or it lets me put in an assignment, well ahead of time, and then add steps as needed.<br><br>Granted, it doesn't sync with my iCal, and I'm not much on web lists. But it does very well as a standalone app, and I manage my lists on my iPod, because sometimes I'm in front of the computer, sometimes I'm not. (And then there are all the medical apps coming up for it...)<br><br>But I'm still carrying the little Moleskine volant!</div>

<div class="content">Forgot to add - I used the trick I saw on a number of the posts, making a folder (or list) entitled Page 1, Page 2, etc. I put my recurring tasks in one entitled "Routines". Then I just let tasks fill up in Page 1 until it hits 35, then go to Page 2.<br><br>I'm still playing with both ToDo and Toodledo - both have advantages - I think that for me the subtasks on Toodledo may be the deal-winner. Plus I can sort tasks by Date added - they show up at the top, not bottom, but at least I know when they got on there.<br></div>

<div class="content">Les, you and I are on the same "page." LOL I have both ToDo and the Toodledo apps on my Iphone and I tend to switch back and forth between the two of them. I have the Pro account also and love it. I keep a page called "Schedule" rather than routines. I also have my default set up to always add new tasks to the folder called "Last Page." When the last page has 32 items, I move them all to a numbered page. Now that I am clearing out the early pages, I can put them all on Page 1, Page 2, etc.--whichever page is now empty. Last Page is then clear and ready for new tasks. Funny you mention the star--I've been using that in a modification of AF that I'm testing out!</div>
