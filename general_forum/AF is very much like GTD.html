<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br><br>At this point, I am afraid that I am in agreement with moises -- AF seems to be very much like a GTD approach.  It is trying to work off a master task list only and one of things that I had significant trouble with doing GTD.  I will try some more, but I am one of those rare people like moises I guess that is not overly enamored to AF.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>AF isn't really remotely like GTD. The GTD master list is an open list which can be selected from in any order.<br><br>AF uses a series of closed lists which are repeatedly worked on in sequence, but with an open list as the last page. The result is that one gets a combination of the speed of an open list with small items together with the "depth" of a closed list.<br><br>If you're not getting this effect then it's possible you are not doing it right.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Okay -- guess I was a bit harsh.  AF is just so radically different than DIT that is has been a bit of a shock.  I will work with it more diligently over the next several days to assess how I get along with it.<br><br>Sorry if I came across to critical.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>To some extent, AF mimicks the way I used to tackle my GTD Next Action lists whereby I would cherry-pick the tasks that felt right to do at that moment which I believe is what David Allen intended should happen.<br><br>But as any honest GTD-er would admit there are usually a pile of Next Actions that have a great deal of resistance built up over them and which you always find excuses to avoid doing. And every time you look at those actions, you feel worse and worse about them because you know you are avoiding them.<br><br>It's usually at the GTD Weekly Review when you are supposed to look at these items that repel you and try and break those actions down even further to lower the resistance. Sometimes you have to go to the point of absurdity such as "get file from shelf" Next Actions.<br><br>With AF, I get rewarded with a feeling of completion even when I do the slightest thing towards getting the task done (you cross it off and re-add to the end of the list). I don't have to complete the action to feel like I'm making progress. So I'm gradually feeling better and better about getting the task finished instead of feeling worse and worse because I still haven't completed the Next Action.<br><br>And further, as Mark implies, the closed-list style of AF forces you eventually to face up to tasks that you are not doing and either kick them off your list or do something towards getting them done. Again, as any honest GTD-er would admit, there are always some Next Actions that have a tendency to take up permanent residence on your list no matter how much you try to force them along.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, that feeling of just doing a tiny bit, adding it to the bottom of the last page then crossing it off (although the last two actions are usually reversed with me) makes the little and often concept real and comprehensive.<br><br>I can think of no other system that allows you to keep so many plates spinning while actioning all the ones that you both want and need to keep going. The ones that were never meant to be float to the surface naturally and can be dismissed naturally by the system. But due to the little and often nature many of the large, scary tasks lose their horror just by chipping away at them.<br><br>It's great! Stick with it and if you're feeling uncomfortable about it just keep checking you're doing it right and changing what needs to be and it may well grow on you.<br><br>Good luck</div>
