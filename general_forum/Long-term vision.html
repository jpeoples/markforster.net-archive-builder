<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>A quick question about the "Dreams" approach: Do you recommend trying to keep one's long-term vision statement relatively short? Mine is currently more than 600 words long, whereas the one you give as an example in the book looks to be more like 200 words. (As you might have noticed in some of my other posts, concision isn't my strong point….) I'm wondering whether a longer vision statement might be harder for the mind to grasp as a cohesive whole (or a "strong integrated image", in your words), and so be less effective.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Martin</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Martin<br><br>I think the essential thing about the Vision is to keep revising it. That may at times mean it gets longer. At other times you might decide that it is getting too long and cut it back. The point is not how long or how short it is, but that you are constantly engaging with it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>OK, thanks. I'm currently revising it every three days, and I tried cutting it down last night. The new, shorter version feels better at the moment, so I'll use that one as a basis for future revision.<br><br>Best,<br><br>Martin</div>
