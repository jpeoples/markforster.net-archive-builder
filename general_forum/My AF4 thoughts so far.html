<div class="content">I've been using AF4 on FocusPad for a few weeks now, and here are my thoughts so far.<br><br>It's a vast improvement and I feel there's a long way to go.  I generally find that when I get into the list for the day, after I review the list for a couple of rounds, I generally feel that sense of confidence that it is tracking everything in my life that I need to be tracking.  But, when I'm looking at 25 pages of stuff, getting to that peace-of-mind stage takes work - it's an investment.<br><br>Most days I can muster up the will to do so, but there are other days, days with a lot of activity, where I don't, and I end up feeling unsettled, like I am forgetting something.<br><br>I think some of it is the size of the list.  One thing that helped me is that I noticed several of my todo items fit a theme.  For instance, I have paid client work, but I also have several of my own side ventures, none of which pay me anything but might give me income in the future if I work on them.  I almost never work on these items in a day; I keep delaying them but never dismissing them.  And they were making my list feel very large.  I recognized this, and decided I would offload all of them - I deleted them all from my AF4 list, put them in an OmniFocus bucket (a separate list), and then in AF4 I put "schedule Ventures day".  I scheduled a Ventures day, and then completed several of the items off that separate list.  The other benefit is that the AF4 list then felt more manageable; small enough that I could grasp the shape/smell/sound/whatever of it when I wasn't staring at it, and didn't feel like I had to review it every time I sat down to use it, and thus didn't feel reluctant to sit down and grapple with the largeness of it.<br><br>But then the list grew again, and now it just feels unwieldy, and to the point that if I start working on it, I worry that I won't start working on the things I actually need to work on because I won't get to them in time for me to make proper headway on them before I have to stop working.<br><br>So in short it seems there is a scaling consideration with AF4.  I can't quite get into the no-mind feeling of just trusting everything is there, because (and this is key) - it regulates the speed with which I go through the list.  If I'm aware there's an urgent item twelve pages from now, I'll work faster through those twelve pages than I will if I'm not aware of something being urgent.<br><br>As a result, I find that an uncomfortably high level of my mental energy is spent on the meta layer - understanding the makeup of my list - than on the do-ing layer.</div>
