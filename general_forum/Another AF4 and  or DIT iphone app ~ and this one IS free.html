<div class="content">Hi All,<br><br>Just rooting round the App Store and came across ZenTask.<br><br>This is a free iphone app companion to a Mac app of the same name.<br><br>Very simple clear interface which just lists new items in the order you enter them.<br><br>Except that on the next day a new list starts at the top.  Apart from today's new entries tasks remain listed in ascending order of entry.<br><br>Completed tasks are filed separately so the working list stays clear.<br><br>Tasks can be grouped by due date and there are automatic groupings for Today, Tomorrow, Past Due and All Tasks<br><br>For DIT you would always set Due to tomorrow, then work on the Today list when the time came around.  <br><br>For AF4 you would work on All Tasks <br><br>It is also possible to set any other grouping for projects / locations,  forward due dates, pririties and recycle taks if you wanted to use them.<br><br>The app syncs to Mac desktop app if you are a user but I have not tried this as I am still working on PC.<br><br>Interesting App able to run various MF task philosophies with scope to tweak if you want more features<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Mike</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for pointing at this one. Still for me (corporate user) it is only web-companion which worth mentioning. That's why I'm so excided over Tony's FocusPad iPhone app - its next version has web companion page with sync. I participate in beta testing of this new version and it looks fantastic  - I'm really looking forward for Appstore release.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I bought focuspad, which looks very promising.<br><br>I did find the completed and paused colours v difficult to read, and never quite worked out how the diamonds were supposed to work.<br><br>Web companion could be a killer...</div>

<div class="content">Diamonds are for marking the whole page. You click the diamond and from now could filter out this marked page from the set of pages you flip through.<br><br>Pale colours of completed are good to me - I really dont want to see the completed tasks crowding the list. And I believe there is no paused status implied there - still you could use colours like blue for them.<br><br>Yeah, the web sync _is_ a killer indeed - the only competition here is www.autofocus.cc site - it is free and looks nice on iPhone but it is slower to operate compared to the native app and there is no offline mode.<br><br>So web sync has almost passed the beta stage -  we could expect submission to AppStore next week!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike,<br>Quick question: how did you get ZenTask to recycle tasks and reenter them at the end? This is one of the really useful features of FocusPad. And when you say that new tasks added tomorrow will start from the top again, what happens the day after? do they move down so that the date created sequence of the bulk of the list is preserved?  I guess I could wait a couple of days to find out but thought you might know! Many thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Jane,<br><br>Thanks.  The app has a facility to recycle completed tasks, but for me each time I have tried this the app exits ~ so I have not seen how it works.<br><br>Working with it again now it seem to keep adding new tasks at top if there is no due date, or at the earlier of due date or in the order they are entered if the due date is the same.  Presumably re-cycled items would follow the same rules but...<br><br>The more rational ordering would make it clearer for AF4 ~ sorry if I confused you.<br><br>Not perfect, but workable with a very neat interface and groupings by date / project which helps when maintaining ubiquitous capture but zooming in on specifics like work / hope / project etc.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I had a lot of crashing, too.</div>
