<div class="content">Has anyone talked about or tried out a system where you scan like Simple Scanning but dismiss like in AutoFocus 1?<br><br>Aka you keep scanning forwards, but if you go through a page without acting on anything you dismiss the page.<br><br>I was thinking the scanning would help you get to time-sensitive items more quickly, while the dismissal would (1) keep the length of the list in check and (2) encourage you to act on older times.</div>

<div class="content">AF1 has you prescan a page before working the page.  If you implement the dismissal rule, I think that’s a necessary feature.  Otherwise pages will be dismissed too often.</div>
