<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-01-7 12:55</div>
<div class="content">I'm getting reactions from as many people as possible about how they would like to see the newsletter in the future. <br><br>Obviously one of the main functions of the newsletter (from my point of view) is to advertise my own products, e.g. seminars, books and I've no intention of ceasing that.<br><br>The main question for me is whether new articles should continue to be posted in two different places, i.e. on the blog or on the newsletter.<br><br>The alternatives I can see at present are:<br><br>a. The newsletter has articles specially written for it which do not appear on the blog. In that way it would be something separate and distinct from the blog.<br><br>or<br><br>b. The newsletter repeats major articles which also appears on the blog. In that case it would be acting as a convenience for people who don't for whatever reason want to read the blog, but do want some input.<br><br>or <br><br>c. The newsletter merely draws readers' attention to what has been appearing on the blog. In this case it would be acting as an extension of the blog and as a way of reminding people to have a look at it.<br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">I think B would work best. <br>You could also add some links at the end for additional topics or articles not included in the newsletter that might encourage people to go to the blog as well.</div>

<div class="content">Having a newsletter still seems to be the best way to get people to actually read the information.  <br><br>Certainly to more 'clicks' that we have to do to get to the useful stuff, the less likely we are to read it.  <br><br>Blogs are often generally less cleanly laid out too.  Id' certainly appreciate the newsletter continuing.<br></div>

<div class="content">I would prefer B, but could live with C.  I like to read the articles, don't always want to get distracted by comments <br><br>Like to hear about new books etc</div>
<h2>Reply by rob</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-01-7 13:51</div>
<div class="content">B.  My reasoning is as follows.  High volume users of the net are turning to blogs as they are easier to manage.  e.g My current blog reading would equate to >100 newsletters!  With a blog feed I can skim and drop into what I want.  Low volume users tend to use newsletters rather than managing a daily blog.  Rgds Rob.</div>
<h2>Reply by Andrea</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-01-7 13:55</div>
<div class="content">I'm more likely to look at my email than look at a blog, so I would prefer b.</div>

<div class="content">I have alot of off-line time so a newsletter that has everything would be great. Thanks for asking.</div>
<h2>Reply by Sarah</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-01-7 14:00</div>
<div class="content">prefer b. with articles as brief but useful as possible, as i wouldn't click on the blog link every time.  A very brief resume of what's new on the blog could be included after the newsletter article.</div>
<h2>Reply by David</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-01-7 14:01</div>
<div class="content">Mark, I'd vote for B. If everything was posted to your weblog, then visitors can subscribe to your RSS feed to get all articles in their news feed reader - not a millions miles from subscribing to a newsletter - else they can read your posts in situ on the weblog itself. If you maintained a newsletter in addition to this then you're making more work for yourself, and for your readers who will want to make sure they can read everything.<br><br>So a plan would be to encourage people to subscribe to your news feed rather than your email newsletter.</div>

<h2>Reply by Rob</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-01-7 14:21</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I personally would not visit the blog too often and would prefer not to have a huge email newsletter type thing. So my own opinion is that C is the best option, with the newsletter starting off the article and then drawing me to read further online if I feel inclined to do so - would that not work better from your point of view as well (marketing)?<br><br>Thanks for personally getting back to me in the past, it made me take the time to give this feedback!<br><br>All the best<br><br>Rob</div>
<h2>Reply by Caroline</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-01-7 14:21</div>
<div class="content">Definately the newsletter for me - much easier! I am much more likely to read it when it's sent in an email, rather than having to move to another link to find it. Look forward to receiving the next one!</div>

<div class="content">Definitely B blog/newsletter duplication.  If I'm on your blog list, I won't want your newsletter, and vice versa.<br><br>I actually thought the other day that I had unsubscribed from your newsletter. All I was getting was seminar announcements in the UK.  The reason I subscribed was to read any articles you posted, not hear about seminars I won't be attending.<br><br></div>
<h2>Reply by Rob Wright</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-01-7 14:25</div>
<div class="content">Happy New Year, Mark. You asked for my preference, but can I share an opinion that might help you make a strategic decision?<br><br>As a marketing communications professional, I believe blogs are ideal for exploring ideas, highlighting incidentals and jotting down thoughts. Critically, the medium allows stakeholders to interact and give feedback. Because blogs directly encourage dialogue, they can help cement lively relationships with a target audience (and by implication, help build brand).<br><br>This informality, where your audience can choose to view or interact at their leisure, suggests blogs might not carry the necessary gravitas for articles.<br><br>A newsletter mailing, however (opted into by the recipient) was presumably sold on the promise of supplying fully thought through presentations of insight and intelligence that can help change their lives. Nothing experimental; nothing explorational: just seasoned 'truths' that are known to work. For me, articles carry a kudos that says 'learning that should not be missed'.<br><br>And if there's something I really need to hear, I don't really want to wade through a blog to get to it.<br><br>I find this distinction in the character of the two platforms helpful and one that resonates with most people's conscious and subconscious perceptions. Blogs can give people with the time, space to reflect and think for themselves, whilst a newsletter can efficiently present perspectives they don't have to grapple with too much but can accept as fact should they choose to.<br><br>So, to answer your question directly, I would use your e-newsletter to carry articles (introduced in the e-mail but featured fully on your website should you need to drive traffic there) but also use the newsletter to add the odd intriguing or useful detail from your blog to win the interactivity you need to build your relationships.<br><br>Hope that helps! <br><br>All the best, Rob Wright (copywriter & creative planner)</div>

<div class="content">My instinctive reaction is to go for option c. I'm not a very experienced rss feed user yet, and I'm concerned about being overwhelmed by blogs I might subscribe to, however useful they might be! I appreciate having a prod from an email newsletter, and I would find a brief summary of what you've been writing about really useful. I've been missing your newsletter, so do hope any new system works for you - I really value your observations and suggestions. Best wishes, Claire</div>

<h2>Reply by MiGrant</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-01-7 15:12</div>
<div class="content">Option A might make sense if you actually have two different classes of articles in mind -- do you? Otherwise, I don't see much sense in arbitrarily shunting some of your writing in one direction and some in another.</div>

<div class="content">I would prefer option B, more than C. but not A. The point is that some people are old-fashioned or hesitant to get into blogs.

<div class="content">Okay, so this is twice I"ve tried to post this which just confirms my reason for preferring email. Here it is again:<br><br>Option B is best because of it's focus. On busy days, I'm more likely to avoid web pages which take too much time because they have TMI - so many distractions. The email is to the point. So if I want more, I can choose to do so. Also, with the email, I can read it now, then reread it later at my convenience without visiting a web page unless necessary.<br><br>Thank you for everything.</div>

<div class="content">Dear Mark,<br><br>In my working situation I am not sitting infront of a computer for most of the day, but I do check my mail once every day (in bulk of course...), and links in your newsletter to recent events on your website would make it easier to stay in touch with what is going on.<br><br>If you add parts of more than one article and/or various discussions from your website to your newsletter then I will definitely be very inspired to check the website more often and I will probably buy any new products of yours or that you recommend from others. I can then also check what I find applies to me rather than have to read through lots of subjects that don't apply first.<br><br>Hope this is helpful for you and thank you for all of your good advice.<br><br>best wishes Simon</div>

<div class="content">Definitely B - I check my email daily so it's right there in front of me.   I have signed up for a few newsfeeds (incl. your blog) but find I don't often check them.

<div class="content">Mark, I think A is the go.  Structured and complete articles separate from random thoughts and ideas on the blog prove to be more beneficial in my view. Your structured newsletters of the past are invaluable in building up a library of proven concepts.  Stick with A and allow those of us who want, to go to the blog for the more random approach.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - Let me ask a basic question: what exactly are you attempting to accomplish with each communication tool? They both can serve two different purposes based on their stucture or you can treat them both the same. My idea of a blog is a free-form idea/feedback generator - a sort of freeform, stream-of-conscious survey of Planet Forster. Whereas the articles are the product of more rigorous, informed conclusions, ideas, plans and philosophy. In my view the two should feed off each other in a dynamic relationship. I think I would benefit from that interplay. But, that's my 2c...</div>

<div class="content">It is option 'b' for me.<br><br>It is diffcult to visit a blog every time. It is a better idea to make your email "self - sufficient", rather than make it just a "teaser". The former would also save time.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I think option C would be the best way forward as long as the information just gave you enough information to decide if the article on your blog was relevant for the individual.  I think that a blog is a good idea but can soon be forgotten if there is not some form of regular "push" communication.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I'd prefer option B. As there have been fewer updates on your site recently and no emails I've not been visiting so often.<br><br>I agree with Jarius above that it would be useful to get clear what the communications are that you want to do first, and then consider which medium to use.

<div class="content">Dear Mark<br><br>I am a big fan of your work, having attended your time management workshop in March 2003, and having bought your first two books (still need to get round to buying the third one!), and I always look forward to your newsletters with much anticipation.<br><br>However, I agree with Jane that, sadly, without the newsletter content, I would not get round to reading your blog. It's hard enough just reading and dealing with daily emails, without having to do extra work just to gain your tips (as useful and amusing as they are - and yes, I do recommend you on to many people, for your course and your books).<br><br>Option A seems to involve a lot more work for you, so presumably that's not time-efficient for you; <br>Option C seems to involve a lot more work for us, the readers, which makes it not time-efficient for us;<br>Option B has the potential to discourage people from visiting your blog if everything is provided for them in a newsletter (ideal for us but not for you!)<br>So, as Volker so neatly suggests, perhaps you could feature a main article in your newsletters, plus annotated links to all the previous entries to your blog that might stimulate interest to go look them up?<br><br>Whatever you choose, I am grateful that you are doing it!<br><br>Happy New Year 2008!<br><br>Best wishes<br>Colette</div>

I tend not to go to the blog without a prompt - partly "out of sight, out of mind" but also because, since it is interesting, I can end up spending more time than I wanted to reading it!</div>

<div class="content">Unless the newsletter gives a "plus", it just doubles the blog. I would like to suggest an option D:<br><br>- Newsletter contains the highlights from the blog and a feature article that will only be published on the blog one month later (think about the excitement of attending a movie pre-screening or receiving in the post the magazine you subscribed to before anyone else can buy it in the shop).<br><br>- Having articles only for the newsletter would be a waste of creative energy.</div>

<div class="content">It seems to me that there are rss feeds for those who want b or c. You could use a blog software that allowed people to subscribe to replies to particular threads. From a business perspective, A) would remind people you are there, and encourage them to reconnect with the blog. I think you would get more mileage out of A) and since I visit the blog anyway, I would choose thoughtful, carefully written articles in a newsletter that don't appear on the blog. If I can access all your content anytime I want, for free, why would I bother keeping in touch? Think some of your articles on projects could easily be tke kind that would go in a newsletter. You could give people a "tip" on the newsletter contents when it does come out, and give them the opportunity to sign up, etc.<br><br>-Thanks for your work and <br>Best Wishes,<br>Gordon</div>
