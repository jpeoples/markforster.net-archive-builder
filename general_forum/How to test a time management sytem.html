<div class="content">Appologies if this has been covered before now (I'm happy to be re-directed). <br><br>I would like to test the latest and future systems I'm using in a more objective way than simply based on my usual knee jerk / emotional reaction. <br><br>How can we test a system using reasoning and logic? <br><br>What do others think, or do, to establish whether a system stucture works for them? <br><br>Any thoughts appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br>Unfortunately "your usual knee jerk/emotional reaction" is probably the major factor in whether a system works for you or not.<br><br>So one way to evaluate a system is how long it takes before you get fed up with it and junk it for something new. That's easy to measure, and may well give you very useful information.<br><br>Alternatively you might draw up a list of everything you hope to do over a chosen length of time and give points to each project/task according to its difficulty, desirability and other relevant factors. After the period was over you could then evaluate the system according to how many points it had scored.<br><br>The trouble with this approach is that the evaluation system itself is going to impact on the system you are testing.<br><br>The best method is probably to keep an "Achievement Diary" while you are working a system, in which you record anything you do which you regard as noteworthy. It would be important to record negative things as well. This would give you a basis on which to make a more informed judgement.</div>

<div class="content">I have numbers to look at when I'm trying new approaches, but just as Mark is saying, it doesn't really matter if I'm super productive if I absolutely hate the system. I'll quit using it. Alternately, if I'm getting a lot done, I'm more likely to like the system. Every week I ask myself if I'm getting more done? If not, I quit and move on. Just to encourage you, my testing has resulted in a system that I absolutely love. It includes a combination of two of Mark's approaches. I'll write about it soon on <a href="http://psychowith6.com/category/productivity" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://psychowith6.com/category/productivity</a></div>

<div class="content">Avrum, it seems like a lot of TM stuff is geared toward IT people or entrepreneurs. I would say that most of my offline friends use a datebook and some occasional lists and that's the end of it. <br><br>Seraphim, there's a lot to be said for idonethis. I really liked that it focused due attention to what was accomplished rather than always looking at what wasn't.<br><br>I have put up an explanation of the DIT / AF hybrid I have been using for several weeks that feels like it could actually be a keeper. Mark's recent statement about trying a 7-day "destroy backlog" task when the DIT list became 3 days overdue got me thinking. I decided to give myself just 3 days past due to complete everything before destroying overdue tasks-- with the caveat that I could use little and often for the tasks. Any little thing could permit me to redate the unfinished task for tomorrow.<br><br>I wanted to test it for several weeks because I was sure that using little and often would result in a gigantic list that I couldn't possibly take on. It hasn't. I'm not sure why, but this approach is the most motivating one I've found. It has enough of the gaming approach of AF that I am bound and determined not to let things become overdue, but allows me to work on current tasks without any extra rules. FYI, I have had to delete a couple of tasks, so I've used it beyond the immediate honeymoon phase. <br><br>Here's the post where I give more details. <a href="http://www.psychowith6.com/can-project-management-help-get-done/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychowith6.com/can-project-management-help-get-done/</a> (scroll down to the second half) Please let me know if you have any questions. If you try it, please, please let me know! I'd love to find out if it's something that works just for me or for others, too.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br>Good list, but none of them quite do it for me. <br><br>One thing I've realized is that one shouldn't underestimate the power of trivia. Thinking up great projects is all very well but they often don't go anywhere because they haven't grown organically. Trivia provides the seedbed from which real creativity grows. <br><br>So I think my definition of productivity would have to be about growing wonderful things out of unpromising material.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>Well, it's really only a half-though at the moment brought on by michael's list.<br><br>It occurred to me that one of the reasons I like Autofocus, specifically AF1, is precisely because it results in a long list in which almost every thought of my mind is reflected. So what is often seen as a disadvantage is actually an advantage.<br><br>I think I mistook what AF achieves when I named it. It is not a whittling down of a lot of things into a few, which is what I thought it would do. It is more a case of growing a few splendid plants from a lot of seeds. The seedbed is necessary to this process.<br><br>So perhaps I ought to change the name from AutoFocus to Seedbed.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><<one of the reasons I like Autofocus, specifically AF1>><br><br>In my mind, I flirt with returning to AF1, mostly driven by nostalgia but also because it was one of the only systems that encouraged me, via the rules, to USE my lists. Everything from GTD to DWM to the system I'm using now, allows me to do whatever I want, with little regard to the list I've created. In time, the lists feels somewhat irrelevant. <br><br>Hm, a return to AF 1....</div>

<div class="content">After watching this: <a href="http://alturl.com/8htic" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://alturl.com/8htic</a> <br>I wonder if I could sustain the attention and discipline of sticking to a list. There is no question that's my problem. The other problem I have is a misperception that I'm more creative and free-thinking without rules and lists. Reality would suggest that, barring set calendar appointment i.e. client work, I cave into mindless activity.</div>

<div class="content">> change the name from AutoFocus to Seedbed<br><br>This is more significant than it seems. It would change the attitude and intentions around the list from "what I need to get done" to "what I want to grow and create", "what I want more of in my life". Things to work toward, more than things to be rid of or get done, the kind of change you want to make.<br><br>If you are coming from an energy that sees the list as problems to deal with then that will not allow inspirations from the imagination to be creative.</div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br>It's the same dot as I use to mark tasks in FV. Nothing complicated.

In reality the tasks are aligned and the dots are projecting to the left.</div>

<div class="meta">2013-11-14 12:26</div>
<div class="content">OK Mark, thanks - so do you not use a dot to identify the item you are working on? Or do you have effectively 2 dots for an unfinished item you are working on right now?<br><br>It's of significant interest to me as I have a pattern of startting lots of things but failing to finish them, leaving them undone and floundering.</div>

With your method, you only work on each unfinished task once every pass through the list. With my method, each pass you work on all the unfinished tasks as many times as is necessary to get them finished. So at the end of a pass, there should be no unfinished tasks left - unless the "can't do the same task twice running" rule has come into effect, in which case there would be one unfinished task left.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>There's nothing more to tell. I've described everything already:<br><br>1, Standard AF1 rules, except:<br><br>2. Re-enter unfinished tasks with a dot.<br><br>3. A dotted task must have some action taken on it every time you come to it in the normal course of scanning the list.<br><br>4. If it's still unfinished, re-enter it at the end of the list with a dot as before.<br><br>5. If the above rules would result in having to take action on the same dotted task a second time immediately after taking action on it, then leave it on the last page and go back to the beginning of the list. This will only happen when there is a single dotted task left on the last page and no other task stands out for action.</div>

In it you re-enter unfinished tasks at the end of the Old List with a dot, which means that they have to have some action taken on them. Since no new stuff is ever added to the Old List, this does result in the filtered list of tasks which you are committed to finishing - as described by Wooba.<br><br>I think this worked better for me than any other version of UTMS. But it still came up against the problem of all AF4 based systems - that it takes a very long time before the New List becomes the Old List. That's why I prefer to use the dotting method with AF1.<br><br>The advantage of rewriting unfinished tasks at the end of the list is that it results in these tasks being finished faster. If you leave them in place with a dot they are only worked on once every pass through the list. If they are at the end of the list they have to be finished in the same pass before you can start the next pass.<br><br>For those who don't remember UTMS:<br><a href="../blog/The Ultimate Time Management System.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/6/13/the-ultimate-time-management-system.html</a><br><br><a href="../blog/The Ultimate Time Management System Improved.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/7/2/the-ultimate-time-management-system-improved.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Mark - <br><br>A few years ago, you encouraged me to put "time wasting" tasks on my AF 1 list. I believe you suggested breaking down the individual sites (facebook, montreal canadians, etc) versus simply putting "surf web" on the list. However with these rules, the dot guarantees that I will waste time (as if I need a list to encourage this behaviour), given that "facebook' will always be a re-entered unfinished task, with a dot. Is this how you treat things like Facebook? <br><br>By the way, it's really nice to be engaging with you, AF and this forum again. Off to donate....</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>With the dotting method it's important that you have defined when the task is finished.

<div class="content">Thanks Mark. I agree with your critique about UTMS. I partly solved the long time getting to the new list by making sure I check the new list every day and...<br><br>Do the new list following AF2 rules, that is starting from the newest and always going back to the newest when a task is completed. That means the most recent items get hit first in the new list, not last. <br><br>I would go back to AF1 in a heartbeat, but I found I have to use Outlook (work) and cannot find a way to make AF1 work in that environment.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: <br><br><< With the dotting method it's important that you have defined when the task is finished. >><br><br>Ah, I didn't realize the dot was optional when re-entering tasks. I'm currently editing my book, and usually use "edit book" as a task in my current (slowly becoming old) system. To use this rule, I'd need to change the longer term goal of "edit book" to "Edit section 3" or something like that.</div>

<div class="meta">2013-11-14 21:55</div>
<div class="content">Since the AF days, I always associate a 'dot' with 'one task I am doing now' , it's always helped me to focus on the one selected task. I personally think I might struggle with lots of dotted items - especially if the tasks do not need to be done in order (or do they?) as in FV<br><br>So When it comes to re-entering an unfinished task, I may try placing a small horizonal line (or a vertical one) measuring just a centimetre or so to identify it as an unfinished task. Then I will place a dot more a less in the middle of the line so I can initiate focus on the selected task. I could then repeat this process until the task is done. <br><br>Obviously new and recurring tasks do not have a line drawn before them. <br><br>It probably sounds more complicated in theory than it actually is practice!</div>

I personally don't find it in the least confusing since "the one task I am doing now" is always the first dotted item.<br><br>However it's really up to you how you mark the tasks. That's not going to effect the way the system works.</div>
