<div class="content">I used to do that on purpose! I avoided writing stuff down by just doing everything immediately. I imagined it like the "stack" in a computer, and I kept track pretty well of each layer of interruption. The breaking point was when I would spend all day getting back down to the bottom of the stack. That's when I became one of "those people" who made lists!</div>

<div class="content">No, this isn't really drift mode. As one of the commenters on the video says this is a case of Proximity Prioritisation Syndrome: that which is closest to you gets your immediate attention - also known as "Do It Now". I discuss this in my first book "Get Everything Done".<br><br>And it can strike at any age - ask any teenager!</div>

<div class="content"><<No, this isn't really drift mode>><br><br>I didn't think so either. Drift mode would be a video of me, sitting on my computer, reading about why my friend's diet isn't working.</div>

<div class="content">Great!   I didn't realize it had a more precise name.   Thanks Mark and Avrum!   (and obliquely, Sylvia also!)</div>
