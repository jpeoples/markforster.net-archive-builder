<div class="content">Recently I've found myself resisting using AF.It's just that theres so much entered that the thought of reviewing the whole notebook to make sure I wasnt missing deadlines felt like too much work.<br>I should know better-I should trust the system!<br>But that feeling of having to do a daily review was sort of damper on my "intuition".<br><br>So what I've now done is entered items with deadlines on the appropriate line,but UPSIDE DOWN and in CAPITALS.<br>So if I want to see just the deadlines I need to work toward,I just turn the notebook upside down and these items are obvious.I then work on these in usual manner.<br><br>Appeals to my creative side and doesnt seem to break the system or overcomplicate it.<br>Just felt like sharing this.<br><br>Cheers<br>Jay</div>

<div class="content">I put the deadline date if there is one in the very right margin, that way I can do a quick scan and see what's coming up.<br></div>

<div class="content">I use my calendar to manage deadlines, by entering the deadline itself and reminders before.<br><br>With AF, my calendar is almost empty now, because before, I stuffed everything into it - deadlines, dates and tasks I've planned to do on a specific day or in a specific week. Now all tasks are in the AF lists, and I see everything time-specific at a glance.<br><br>This depends, of course, of the job one has to do.</div>
