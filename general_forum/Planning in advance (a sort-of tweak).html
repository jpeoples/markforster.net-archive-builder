<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I have had an issue that I have lots of tasks - more than I have time for.  This means that I don't always end up progressing my key projects during a day.  Althoguh working efficiently, "have to do them soon" tasks were preventing my dealing with "must get these done to move forward" tasks.<br><br>I know Mark talks about choosing the next task before you leave off for the day.  I have extended this recently to choose two tasks that I have to work on tomorrow before I shut down for the day.  I allow myself to choose tasks from anywhere on the list.  I have to work on those in an autofocus way - just do something.  For the rest of the day, I work according to the rules.  <br><br>This has been a simple change that has improved my feeling of achievement.  No matter what happens in a day, or how stuck I get on one page, I progress two important tasks.<br><br>Hope that helps someone else.</div>

<div class="content">Hi DrCris,<br><br>This is a very good idea - -thanks for sharing!  I routinely start my day with a current initiative (see other thread) and then work from my AF lists when I have discretionary time blocked off.  If I do find myself in the situation you have described....and it happens with me A LOT these days, I will pick 2-3 things that I know have to be done now.  <br><br>You might want to look at the tweak by Christine B.  I think it is brilliant and I am using that now with my AF lists.  I am finding that it helps resolve these kinds of issues.<br><br>I look forward to seeing more posts from you, DrCris.  Please let us know how you are getting along with things.<br><br>Take care and best wishes!<br><br>-David</div>
