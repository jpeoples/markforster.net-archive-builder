<div class="content">I just received this today: The 5 Choices: The Path to Extraordinary Productivity - <a href="http://alturl.com/4fry2" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://alturl.com/4fry2</a><br><br>I'm sucker for Covey's top-down approach to productivity, so this was an easy purchase. My understanding is that this is the 7 Habits, rebranded/refreshed. <br><br>Anyway... thought fans of Covey would appreciate the info.</div>

<div class="content">And reauthored of course, as Covey has passed on.  Let us know how the writing is.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan.<br><br>An oversight on my part. Thanks for the clarification.<br><br>They dedicate the book to Stephen Covey.</div>

<div class="content">It's more of an in-depth look at habits 1,2,3 and 7 then a reworking of the 7 habits.  Worth a read - I read the shorter version they give out on the 5 Choices course.  It has some good tips, along with some worthwhile points about having the right mindset.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ben.<br><br>I started it today. Glad to hear about those habits... my personal faves from the 7 Habits canon.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum, <br><br>Any further thoughts on the 5 choices?  I've been reading the book again and there is some good stuff in it.  I particularly like the practical process for making what you want to achieve in your roles and goals concrete and specific.<br><br>Ben</div>

<div class="content">Ben H.<br><br>I think that was the last book I read before crafting my own system. I don't recall finishing the book, and felt it lacked depth and originality - at least compared to 7 Habits.<br><br>Since then, I developed my own system, which I continue to use. For the first time since 2002 (when I discovered 7 Habits), I've lost the itch to try new systems and tools. It's a lovely feeling.</div>

<div class="content">@Avrum "Since then, I developed my own system, which I continue to use. For the first time since 2002" What is your own system ? If uou use it since 2002 I guess it is working for you... Could tell us more about it ? Kind regards</div>

<div class="content">jupiter:<br><br><<What is your own system ?

Appx 9 months ago, I hired a graphic designer to design the daily and project forms. <br><br>Once my book is launched (Fall), I'm going to put together a couple of videos demonstrating the system/tool.</div>
