<div class="content">How are you keeping up at home?  I suppose some people are still work as usual, some laid off, and some like me are working but at home instead of going out.  It's a bit harder to keep productive at home, but so far I'm (mostly) mananging.  Lenten challenge still continues.  A luta continua?</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I've been working from home since last Thursday and it has been a real transition for me. <br><br>I realize I need more structure than what "The Bounce" offers so I am scheduling more work on my calendar, using 90 minute project slots and also scheduling some "Bounce" time as well.</div>

<div class="content">It is distracting times. I have worked from home for years. Everyone all being super nice when we go out for walks in the neighborhood. It seems like we would have more time for work without running errands, going to social events etc. But hasn't been the case for us. We have this urge to clean our house more than usual. <br><br>I'm sticking to Spinning Plates, deciding if it offers more focus to make a general "plate" ie. computer work, clean etc. or get more specific like "style the web site buttons". <br><br>Best to all our forum.</div>

<div class="content">Apart from having a calendar full of cancelled events, life is much the same as normal.</div>

<div class="content">I'm finding it hard work keeping boundaries around work time at home with 3 under-10s in the house, and no spare screens to give them eg video led activities while partner and I try to keep our jobs going.  DIT is fine in that it gives clarity to tasks for the day, issue is more keeping boundaries clear.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Colin, here's an article on El Reg which talks about that and offers tips.<br><br><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/21/home_working_register_guide/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/21/home_working_register_guide/</a></div>

<div class="content">I've been more productive than usual lately, but started at a low. My desk is in the living room, and teenager, who hadn't had a proper holiday in three years needed time there with videos. (Swimming and first aid classes and leading canoe trips all summer doesn't count as a holiday.)<br><br>Then the school moved online. Teenager set up a desk in the garage and a daily routine. My desk is now quiet late morning to mid-afternoon. If I do my desk work then, I can go to another room when they are ready for the living room. That's just enough pressure to get me to do my work then rather than put it off.<br><br>I also discovered that the best routine for me isn't what I thought. Years ago when the kids were young and I had to get up with them, housework first thing worked best. Then I could spend the rest of the day on the computer, until picking them up. Now a slow morning, deskwork when Teenager "goes to school", housework after lunch, and more desk until "school's out". Then any remaining housework. I also set up a desk in my room, so we can all Zoom at the same time. It's easy for me to do deskwork there if it doesn't need a big screen.</div>
