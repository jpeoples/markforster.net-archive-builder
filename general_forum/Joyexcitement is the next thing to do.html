<div class="content">As Mark has said, organizing by importance or urgency undermines the intuition (inner-tuition). Excitement I view as e-motion (energy in motion) flowing as expressing our true self and is therefore the criterion for the best next thing to do and is my preferred organizing principle for trusting what is the next thing to take action on that I can act on at the time. This is the engine behind autofocus in my view, it also acts to auto-intend.</div>

<div class="content">If I prioritized by excitement, I'm afraid I'd spend all day playing strategy games and reading old novels...   :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark makes a similar point in his book "Make your dreams come true". He observes in the book that by trusting his feelings his mind seems to pull him toward a future version of himself and there is a much reduced need to push and be driven for results. The best order of things seems to be allowing the energies of creation to pull us. This requires acceptance of how things are, forgiveness of the past as being perfect to bring you to this awareness, and surrendering the ego to intuition/feeling.</div>
