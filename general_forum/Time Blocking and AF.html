<div class="content">As a former GTD'r, I was curious if using a combination AF / Context would work since i like to time block. It would seem to make sense to have my @ calls list using AF then @ computer etc. If I am at my desk and I have an hour blocked off for calls, it would seem to make sense to just be looking at my AF @ calls list!<br>Anybody else doing this or have suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mitch<br><br>While I fully understood the reason behind contexts I really struggled to get them to work for me without adding lots of overhead. Scoped too narrow and I would be moving actions from context to context, too broad and I was overwhelmed by long lists of actions not knowing what to do first. AF has zero context overhead, I just have a book for work and a book for home.<br><br>John</div>

<div class="content">Mitch:<br><br>I think many former GTDers seem to have trouble letting go of some of the concepts in GTD when coming to AF. They are two very different systems and work on very different principles. I would recommend you to let go of GTD completely and try pure AF at least initially. When you have experienced how the system is supposed to work, then you can include some personal "extras" if you still want to.</div>

<div class="content">Mitch,<br><br>I, too, have come from GTD, and I must say, I do not miss my contexts at all.  That is, I do not miss them now that I have used AF as intended for a while.  I did miss them intellectually, which is somewhat different.<br><br>So, as Mark has already said, just give it a go, maybe for a week, and stick to nothing but the original instructions.  Then you will have some experience which will give you a much better frame of mind to ponder changing some aspects.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the comments. I'm going to give AF a shot for a couple of weeks and I hope I can get used to it. Another question: Let's say I just started with my AF list and one item on the list is "make 20 new prospect / cold calls". At some point in the day I decide to get on the phone and hammer out these calls.I will keep a separate sheet that has the names and numbers of the prospects to call, but after making about 12 calls I decide to move on to something else. Do I put "make 20 new prospect / cold calls" at the bottom of the list and cross out or highlight the "uncompleted" earlier entry and then later in the day knock out the rest of the calls and highlight the newer entry as completed? Am I getting this???</div>

<div class="content">Mitch:<br><br>Yes - if you don't finish a task, for whatever reason, you should cross it out and re-enter it at the end of the list.</div>

<div class="content">... and in that specific case I would reword it to "make 8 new prospect / cold calls" or more general: "make new prospect / cold calls" :-)<br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">I was a little bit surprized that you discussed under the heading "time blocking" the contexts of GTD. You can use time blocking for several things, e.g. to work on a project, a specific routine work, etc. What I start now to use it for is for AF. During the last days I almost did not come to the AF lists due to appointments and time bound activities. That made me quite uneasy - which was compensated by my nearly daily run through all pages to see what is absolutes urgend. To improve the situation I will now put appointments on my agenda for working on the AF list and not only from the today list. Maybe that brings me back closer to the lists.<br><br>Wolfgang</div>
