<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Okay, I'm willing to start the experiment, but I'm a little confused when it comes to migrating all my tasks to the new system. <br>I have here an old "closed" AF4 list that still has tons of stuff in it, plus a more recent DIT backlog. How do I best transfer them to DWM? I have seen some ideas mentioned in several posts, but if I haven't missed something (couldn't read everything that was written since the initial announcement), there is no 'approved' method to switch yet. <br><br>From the instructions, one should probably dump all tasks into the +1 month date (March 4), but this doesn't seem sensible to me. The thought of having a large part of them expire when that day arrives, scares me. OTOH, the time period between today and March 4 would contain all my tasks anyway, and scattering them between those two dates wouldn't change anything. I would still have to do some work on them, or let them expire.<br><br>Or should one start a completely new list, and just abandon all the old stuff? <br><br>And what about the AF advice to keep separate notebooks for work and home? For me, it still seems to make sense, and I'm planning to keep them separate.</div>

<div class="content">Mark started over from scratch.<br><br>I began feeding tasks from the old AF4 book onto day 30 of the new system, a few at a time.  Each day I pulled some of the more urgent/important ones into the new system.  Over a few days, they will have migrated.  One additional benefit is getting to rethink and rewrite the tasks as I rewrite them.<br><br>The most important thing is to NOT flood the new system.  Just a old items a day.</div>

<div class="content">I've gone with all my old AF4 tasks on March 2 (started Feb 2).  I figure if I do not take action on some within that time, I wasn't going to do them anyway.  If I do take action, I will be compelled to keep taking action every week to keep them alive.<br><br>I don't yet see the downside with this approach.  By March 2, most of those initial tasks will have either been already pulled into earlier weeks by re-entering, or else completed.  Those that aren't will die a death that they deserve.</div>

<div class="content">I did a dump as well.  Granted, my list was pretty small - I only moved over 39 tasks, one of which was "last dismissed items" because I was due for a review of dismissed items.  Of those, I have worked on 22 and deleted one, so they're not stagnating.  I definitely added more "new" items on that day than I have on the three days since, but not by a huge margin.  (For comparison's sake, I added 30 new items on day 2, 23 on day 3, and 24 so far on day 4 - today).</div>

<div class="content">If you don't dump it all in, try making new tasks such as "Scan old AF4 list for new tasks".  Act on this task regularly over a few days, grabbing the best ones a few at a time until the old list is finished.</div>

<div class="content">"The thought of having a large part of them expire when that day arrives, scares me."<br><br>Thinking about this statement could be the most helpful part of your migration. If you honestly think that a large part of your tasks will not stand out within a 30 day period and this worries you, you have not been doing AF.</div>

<div class="content">I actually had a dated AF4 list - everyday before entering new items I put the date on top. So I simply moved everything one month from the date it was entered. It has spread the tasks out quite nicely.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Interesting idea. Would you put the transferred tasks in at 7 days, as "already chosen and committed" or a month, as an idea for review?<br><br>Another approach would be to keep te AF list going, but reenter unfinished tasks on the 7 day list. This should whittle down the AF list quite quickly to the hard core of things which aren't actually getting your attention (i.e. you should go through the open list very quickly, so more of your time is spent in the closed list, so you quickly get to the stage where you have to dismiss the closed and close the open. Then you can't get off the closed list until it is done.)<br><br>This would trap you on the old tasks until they are complete, dismissed or moved to the new list. You might want to set aside time for the AF list every day as a current initiative and increasingly use the DWM list as the main one. It's really just a slightly complicated way of declaring a backlog.</div>

<div class="content">Have moved only a few tasks into the new diary/calendar. <br>No need to rush things.</div>

<div class="content">There are two "approved" ways of starting the list:<br><br>1. (Recommended). Start from scratch and add tasks as you think of them or as they come up in the normal course of events. That's the way I started off with DWM and it has worked just fine.<br><br>2. Add everything from your old list (weeding as necessary) in at the 1-month point. If that fills the page, then continue adding them to the next page. This can be done in stages if you prefer (as Rainer suggests).<br><br>Note that in both the above approaches, all tasks go in at the 1-month point.</div>

<div class="content">Will, if I tried to do what you suggest I would become hopelessly confounded by having an active AF4 list and simultaneously an active DWM list with important tasks hiding 7 days from elimination.  These systems are designed to make time management easy, and your proposal definitely seems the other direction for me.  Just my perspective.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>You're probably right. I can't recommend it from personal experience, as I just redated my existing list to 30 days.<br><br>I would be nervous about just discarding my entire list and starting again, though. Again, haven't tried it, so I can't comment.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark:<br><<1. (Recommended). Start from scratch and add tasks as you think of them or as they come up in the normal course of events. That's the way I started off with DWM and it has worked just fine.>><br><br>I would just add, probably unnecessarily, that you might want to scan the old list for urgent items, to forestall an oh-no-I forgot-about-that moment.  Looking over my old list, I noticed that I needed to buy a ticket for an upcoming concert; if I hadn't done so I might forgotten about it until the day of the concert.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to everyone for their suggestions so far. Since all the contents of my old list simply won't fit into the +1 month slot, I'll probably just scan the old list regularly and add tasks from there to my new list, unless they need doing right away. <br><br>The second question of the original post seems to have been lost, so I might repeat it: Should one use separate work and home notebooks, given one doesn't work from home?</div>
