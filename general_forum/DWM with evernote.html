<div class="content">Not exactly, but kinda sorta...<br><br>I use onenote, not evernote to store all my emails, project notes and reference material. I create links from there to an excel spreadsheet that I use as an AF list. However I keep track of expiration dates and whether I have worked on a task or not, and always review my 30 day and 7 day expired tasks before I leave for the day.<br><br>If this is close enough to your question or if you are interested I am happy to give more information.</div>

<div class="content">@vegheadjones: I was interested in knowing which mechanism to use for marking the started task, in order to dismiss them after 7 days (tags? reminders? dedicated bookmark) based on ather people experiences with evernote.<br>Thanks anyway for your reply.</div>
