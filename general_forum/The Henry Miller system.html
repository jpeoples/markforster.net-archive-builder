<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2013-10-31 15:01</div>
<div class="content">Henry Miller wrote a list of commandments form himself as he wrote "Tropic of Cancer". I thought I'd post them as an amusing - and possibly inspiring - distraction:<br><br>COMMANDMENTS<br><br>    Work on one thing at a time until finished.<br>    Start no more new books, add no more new material to "Black Spring."<br>    Don't be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.<br>    Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!<br>    When you can't create you can work.<br>    Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.<br>    Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.<br>    Don't be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.<br>    Discard the Program when you feel like it—but go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.<br>    Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing.<br>    Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.<br><br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.listsofnote.com/2012/01/henry-millers-11-commandments.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.listsofnote.com/2012/01/henry-millers-11-commandments.html</a></div>
