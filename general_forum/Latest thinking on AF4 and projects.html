<div class="content">Hello Mark and AF forum gang.  I've been "lurking" on this site and in this discussion forum for several weeks and have decided to take the plunge with AF4 (it was Mark's live demo and the fantastic PDF from Andreas Hofmann that made things click with me).  I am a vice president in a large consulting firm.  I oversee several large projects at different clients, as well as many "smaller projects" that I like to take action on each day.  I could see AF4 working very well for those times when I am working actions across all my projects.  But what about those times when I'm sitting down and thinking through what needs to happen over the next month for Client A, or planning out future actions for Project B?  Does the result of that thinking (future actions) go immediately onto the AF4 list and then be subject to repeated review/dismissal/re-entry until it feels ready to be done (could be weeks)?  Or is it better to do this type of thinking "offline" and add these actions to my AF4 list based on some periodic review?  In addition, do you guys keep your project lists "offline", or included as reminders in your AF list ("Revisit Project C")?  Any help or perspectives would be greatly appreciated.  If there is a previous post out there that addresses this I apologize for the repeat.  Anybody in a similar situtation?</div>

<div class="content">Fredrick,<br><br>Welcome.<br><br>We have had that type of discussion before and I think it depends on how you work.  I'll give you my opinion, and expect to get differing ones ;-)<br><br>My  way is to put project things in project "files" (paper, electronic, whatever).   This keeps my thinking clear.  I can see how step 6 relates to step 18, and all of that.  Then I decide what can be done now, and in the near future and put THAT into my time management system.<br><br>AF is not a PROJECT management system, though for small projects it works well enough.  For something larger I'd think about it as a real PROJECT and manage that the way you normally would (Pert/CPM, hand drawn bubbles, word documents, Post-it notes all over the walls ;-)  When you have TASKS coming up, be they for a project or otherwise, then a TIME MANAGEMENT system is called for ... and AF is ideal for that.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Mike. Project management is different than time management. <br><br>Il you need to work on project wich need steps and frequent control about "the bigs rocs" then AF is not adapted. A software such as Omnifocus or microsoft project is much better for you can work in a GTD way. <br>If you have a lo of discrenary time and the order of the tasks are not important but what really matter is if the tasks are done then AF is efficient for it's a TIME MANAGEMENT SYSTEM<br><br>of course you can twick the system. <br>You can use for example paper sheet or computeur heuristics for managing the big view of the project and report the tasks on AF but the consequence will be that you will be unable to have a global view of the tasks if you do it on paper. <br><br>For myself i have realised that some project need a real tak management system. Often it is because i dont control the project. But some others needs nothing but a sample list even  disorganised smply because I control the project. Then AF is great for them. Omnifocus is great for the big view. But on the rush i prefer paper. And on the way of working i like using AF1 and AF4 and sometime AF3 (reverted) for doing my last tasks first. <br><br>Dont ask too much to AF no system is perfect the best is yours if and only if you regularly work with it.</div>

If they are tasks which can be done now, then my advice is to put them on the list. I encourage being as far advanced with any project as it is possible to be at any given time.<br><br>However if for one reason or another, it is not desirable or feasible that a task should be done now, then put it into Outlook Tasks or similar reminder system to be brought forward either for action at a specified date or for further review.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, Jupiter, Mark - thank you very much for your thoughts.  I am going to implement some sort of project system offline to AF4 and use that for my vertical "project thinking".  I will then use AF4 to manage my near and medium-term actions that result from that thinking and place the future items in Outlook or some sort of reminder system.  Mark, I will heed your advice to put as many actions as can be done now on the AF4 list in order to make sure I'm taking action on projects sooner not later.  After reading Mike and Jupiter's input, I think I will adopt a paper system using AF4 for my tasks, with offline folders (both paper and electronic) to manage the various project notes and support materials.  Thanks again guys.  I will check back in and let folks know how it is going.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Frederick, <br><br>I find it best to keep my AF list clean with action oriented items, eg telephone... declutter... review...etc. All other information related to the project is kept in a related file. <br><br>In relation to the timing of a task I find adding a diary note to review something works well, as does writing the specific task in my diary directly where possible.</div>

<div class="content">If you are comfortable with paper, you can draw your own and do it pretty simply.  But PERT/CPM systems really benefit from computerization if you need to get a handle or resources and scheduling.  If not, then just draw a bubble on the extreme right (centered vertically) of a large sheet of paper and put your final outcome.  Then to the immediate left put bubbles for the tasks/milestones/goals/projects that must be completed just before that and connect them to the final bubble.  Do the same for every bubble until you get to those which have no predecessors (can be done right now) and start working.  Easy peasy ... untll you want to find out how long things will take, then the calcualtions by hand are tedious ... but still possible.  (I won't go into it here, but it is just a question of figuring out how long each task will take and adding durations.  But it gets tricky when you consider hours in a day, work days in a week, and multiple people working on it for varying percentages of their days).<br><br>The granddaddy of them is MS Project, which is part of Office 2007 (and 2003, I guess) if you have the whole package.  There are smaller and simpler ones you can get for free as well.<br><br>Here is an overview ... you can search for more.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software</a></div>

<div class="content">@ Mike.<br><br>"Does anyone have suggestions for simple project management systems that work well in tandem with Autofocus?

Make 2 lists of project Classified active or non active project<br>2. Put the high priority project first the regular project after, the project you have to work on after, the project you may work on at the end<br>3. For complicated project use computer omnifocus on mac is great but other are good too<br>4. For simple project use a sheet of paper<br>5. Only put the global big rocs with the objective in first (read GTD David allen method)<br>6. Take time to work on project<br>7. All active tasks ie task you want or can work on are on autofocus <br>8. All non active tasks or task you may do goes on the project<br>9. Report on project historical tasks if you need to report them or if you need to know by the future what you have done. <br><br>a General advice more you control a project less put tasks on it your mind will find the solution. Less you know a subject more you write about it. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">@ Frederick H <br><br>I too run a consulting company with many projects (large and small) across several countries.<br><br>I find AF in general (and lately AF4 in particular) extremely good as my personal productivity tool (and several of my partners do too). But it is not a project planning or tracking tool.<br><br>I keep a seperate notebook that I call my Project Book. In that I keep notes and ideas for future projects and prospects. I use mind mapping and lists and other free-form tools to express my ideas in that book.<br><br>When things feel like they need to happen they go from the Project Book into my Autofocus system.<br><br>Of course big projects involving lots of money and resources need formal project management tools like Gantt charts and budgets etc. We have developed a whole collection of tools using Excel and visual basic and some Access.<br><br>But for my personal projects and those that are small enough for one or two people to manage - I use the combination of my Project Book and the Autofocus pages.<br><br>One of the great features of Autofocus it that it helps me make progress on many fronts at the same time - instead of just narrowing my focus on the urgent and 'important' stuff. So I am happily progressing a dozen projects by muyself as well as managing three multi-million monsters for my clients.<br><br>I do hope you find AF as useful for your work as I have done for mine.<br><br>Respect<br>Paul<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I am involved in real estate projects, but most of the heavy lifting is done by developers and contractors, I use a separate file per project which holds the project information and may have my hand written project plan or a list of tasks in it.  I then use my task management system, but of course that could be a version of AF to put individual tasks into, so they get done.  I also will use tasks like do a complete review of the XYZ building file from time to time to make sure I am on top of the project.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a><br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-8 18:47</div>
<div class="content">Just to clarify...<br><br>We are talking about two different things using the same name:<br><br>- Project Management, in the classical sense is very specific and has well tested tools and procedures to handle the complexity.  It is used for very large projects involving a cast of thousands and resources in the millions.  Like big construction and building ships.  (In fact, the father of this whole thing was the guy who managed the building of the first Nuclear Submarine Admiral Rickover.)<br><br>- We are also using the term "project management" to mean "managing projects" ... this is really a different animal, and one which mostly apples to us.  This is most aptly described as keeping project notes, and developing action plans then putting them into a time management system to be acted upon.<br><br>It might just pay to keep those two ideas distinct.  I don't need a "Project Management" system because nothing I do these days is that complex.  I do need to "manage my projects", however.  I do that in notebooks, Word Documents, and then move the actions into some variant of AutoFocus.<br></div>

<div class="content">@Greg<br><br>Don’t get me going on project management tools! We’ve used so many over the decades and none provided me with what we needed.<br><br>Everywhere I go people are using MS Project – which is a fine tool I’m sure – but it forces one particular view or model of project management on the world. If you link the tasks like you are supposed to do and then something is a day late – it moves everything all over the place as it reschedules. And it does not understand the concept of the working week – people and especially teams, tackle things on a week by week basis. They like to start new things on Monday and finish up by a deadline on Friday. MS Project reschedules things for 14.15 on Wednesday just to make it fit the ‘rules’. And woe betide you if you want to add a 3rd resource to a team but don’t want the week-long package of work to get shrunk by 33.333%! I use MS Project only where I must to keep he corporate immune system at bay.<br><br>The tool we developed allows us allocate work to teams or resources week-by-week in a visual way by moving what we call ‘blobs’ around on a grid (to make a kind of Gantt chart). It then shows, for each resource/task combination the start and end dates, how many days per week and the cost of those days. And the weekly costs by various categories (which we can define at will).The Access database is used to capture the task allocations and transfer the data to whatever corporate accounting system or project management system my clients may have.<br><br>The tool is designed to allow non PMPs (or ‘non-pimps’ as we call them) to read, understand and modify the plan by simply moving the blobs around the grid.<br><br>It doesn’t do load balancing or even automatic rescheduling based on some PERT network – that only confuses people. Instead the non-pimps get to move their blobs around at will until (a) the plan looks like it will get all the work done, (b) none of the teams are over-extended at any point and  (c) the costs are within the budget.<br><br>Over time we have added some bells and whistles – but never at the expense of its simplicity. Its all very colourful too – so people love to use snap-shots in their reports and presentations. If your boss doesn’t like what the plan says – you hand her the spreadsheet and say “here, you make it work out cheaper!” Sometimes they do.<br><br>Anyway -  this is straying off topic for this site.<br><br>Regards<br>Paul<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">This may seem obvious, but I had good little "ah ha" today trying to deal with some project-related tasks. Following the advice here, I do have some separate lists for certain biggish and on-going projects, but when I think of a task to add, it's a bit of a pain digging out the proper list to add to.<br><br>Since I'm working in AF already, I realized I could go ahead and add the task to AF. When I get to, I probably won't do the action of the task, but will transfer the task to the proper list. In short, using AF to maintain the other lists.<br><br>Obvious perhaps, but a nice little helper for me.</div>

<div class="content">Just to add my agreement to what ds and Seraphim have said; I have also been doing this with AF, adding thoughts or plans which I will often move to my Projects where they can be processed properly and then appropriate actions go back onto AF.</div>

<div class="content">Yep, I do the same too. Helps a lot to keep moving and not being slowed down by digging out a projectfile to just enter a note or thought about a project. I put the notes on the lefthand page of my AF notebook and put a task at the end of the list to transfer it to the project file at a later appropriate time.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-10 16:15</div>
<div class="content">Thanks for all the active discussion on this thread.  After a few days of working with my AF4 list and offline project materials, I find that I do the same thing - as ideas for actions occur to me I put them on my AF4 list.  Some are fine to stay right there (typically because they are actions that could be done soon, or they are reminders for projects - small "p").  If I have an idea that best belongs with other Project (large "P") offline materials, I will still add it to my AF4 list, but the action I take is to add it to my offline materials.  That way I can capture the idea as it occurs but not worry at that moment about thinking through the best "home" for it.  Works great so far!  Thanks again for all the great ideas.</div>

<div class="content">MS Project and similar use critical path analysis.  If you are building a house, and you will need roof tiles in four weeks, and roof tiles take three weeks to be delivered, you'd better order roof tiles in one week, or progress will be delayed.<br><br>But most people's work doesn't have dependencies such as that.  As long as the tasks get done by the due date, they can be done in any order . This point is made strongly in DIT, where the order in which you do your tasks is any you like that gets the lists done in a day.  Even in more structured environments, such as software development, the task dependencies are much fewer than one might imagine.  As long as a programmer codes his bit of the application, it doesn't much matter what sequence he followed to get there.<br><br>It's not just that the features that are central to MS Project aren't useful.  They aren't neutral, but negative, in that they get in the way of planning.  The tool will schedule on Thursday in three weeks' time the task you know you will do tomorrow.  You wind up fighting the software to get a sensible plan.<br><br>For this reason, I agree that MS Project is inappropriate for the great bulk of everyday planning.  What is more suitable is a tool that provides a grid, for time along one dimension, people along another, and activities at the intersections; that allows text to be written into the grid squares; and allows the grid squares to be coloured to delineate different projects; and that allows the squares to be moved around to adjust the timetable.  Excel fulfills this description well, but the table editor in Word, or almost any other grid-based tool including small post-it notes stuck on a large piece of flipchart paper, will do just as well.<br><br>The most useful tip I can offer in this simple-minded grid-based approach to planning is that although planning tools typically present time along the horizontal axis, it's much easier to fit the text into the squares if the timeline runs vertically down the page, and the names of the people run along the top.</div>

<div class="content">I worked with a guy on a very large project, some years ago.  He continually fought the CPM system we used.  On talking with him I found that he was not using the tool correctly in the first place.  He would try to tell the systme when HE wanted to do something rather than let the system schedule it for him.<br><br>The way to use the system is to define the tasks and the dependencies.  Next you lay out resources if that pertains.  But if you are a single person it may not.  If you have told the system that tasks A, B, and C are predecessors of task D; that task D must be done in a week; that tasks A, B, and C each take 1 working day ... the system will show you that you can start on ANY of the three predecessor tasks just so you get all three of them done before D must be started.<br><br>I've never had the system tell me WHICH of the tree tasks I should be doing, it just shows me that all three are ready to be started and that all three must be done before I start D.  The whole point of the system is to tell you which tasks you CAN be working on and which you can NOT be working on.<br><br>At least that has been my experience.  I do completely agree that PERT/CPM systems are inappropriate for all but the most complex personal situation.</div>
