<div class="content">On a different thread, I asked:<br><< Does anyone have any other ideas for handling emails that require action? whether one-off or project-related? >><br><br>And Mark Forster answered:<br><< Invest in the Nelson Email Organizer. I've been using it now for over 10 years and it's superb for that sort of thing. >><br><br>Actually I've tried NEO and liked it, but found some incompatibilities with other add-ons that IT had installed...   I'm looking into it again to see if I can give it another try.<br><br>I'd really love to know how you actually use it in practice.  <br><br>For example, let's say you get an email that has an embedded one-off task that you can't do immediately.  You need to do the task "later" ("in the normal course of working your system").   What would you write in your SF list?   And what would you do with the email?<br><br>Another example:  Let's say you got an email that has an embedded task related to a current project with one of the volunteer organizations that you work with.   What would you write in your SF list in this case?   And what would you do with the email?<br><br>Thanks!!</div>

<div class="content">I normally drag the email to the last, "no due date" page in my task list. If the action is not obvious from the subject, I type in the action at the front of the subject before hitting <alt> + S to save.</div>

<div class="content">I personally don't like to respond to emails immediately; I prefer to let it simmer in the back of my head where a purposeful answer will mature and I can write a response that is concise and of value. To accommodate that, I have 3 folders for my emails and I NEVER leave anything in the inbox!<br><br><br>Folders:<br><br>ACTION: This is where I put emails that I know what I want to do with them but just don't have the time to do now. A good example of that would be that I'm at the store and think of a task to do at my computer. I email myself and put the resulting email in that folder to clear my inbox. Another would be correspondence chess moves my father sends me. I see it on my phone and put it in that folder for when I get to my computer later. I review this folder everytime I get to my computer and there is never more then 3 things in there at a time.<br><br>PENDING: Is for stuff that will come up or that I don't know exactly what I want to do with. A good example would be part of a project that I have to tackle but cannot until 1 or 2 days. Or an invitation to a concert that I'm not decided on if to go to or not. There is usually up to 5 things in there at a time. I look at it about once a day.<br><br>WAITING FOR: is for stuff I'm waiting a reply to and that I actually care about it. If I dont receive it in the next 2 days, I email back. Hence I look at it about once a day. There is rarely more then 3 things in there at a time.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>The beauty of NEO is that there is no one way you have to do things, and in fact for most purposes you don't *have* to do anything at all. You can leave it to the program to sort out.<br><br>I'll give my best answer to your examples. But bear in mind that you don't have to do it the same way.<br><br><< For example, let's say you get an email that has an embedded one-off task that you can't do immediately. You need to do the task "later" ("in the normal course of working your system"). What would you write in your SF list? And what would you do with the email? >><br><br>When the email is from someone who only writes to you occasionally, you don't need to do anything to the email. The program files it automatically by Correspondent. So all I would do is put "Reply Bill Jones" on my list. When I was ready to do the task, I'd just go to Bill Jone's file and reply to the email.<br><br><<  Let's say you got an email that has an embedded task related to a current project with one of the volunteer organizations that you work with. What would you write in your SF list in this case? And what would you do with the email? >><br><br>I'd tag the email with the name of the project, and put "Reply Liz Smith re Africa Project". Then when the task was ready to be done, I could either go to the Africa Project File or Liz Smith's file.<br><br>Alternatives I might use in certain circumstances:<br><br>- leave the email as Active so that it continues to appear in my Active Mail folder.<br>- tag it as a To Do<br>- flag it (with a date if necessary).<br><br>I have tasks to regularly check the contents of the To Do and Flagged folders, so there's a fall-back if for some reason I miss it otherwise.<br><br>You can also add notes to emails, so that you can remember what exactly it was that you needed to do with it.</div>

<div class="content">I should add that when I do a batch of mail, I move all the contents of the inbox to a "Process now" folder (<ctrl>+A, drag). When I have gone through the process now folder, I drag it to a "2011 Reference" folder.<br><br>This guarantees that the inbox is periodically cleared. I find that trying to reply as I clear almost always slows me down. The purpose of going through the inbox is to know what I need to do. Doing it is driven through SF. In theory.</div>

The program automatically separates out those emails which still require processing, and automatically puts emails into a "2011" Folder. You don't have to do anything for this to happen.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Sounds great: it's on my list to look at.<br><br>(Though I'm happy with my process: it runs off closed lists, clears the inbox and only takes a few seconds of overhead with each batch of mail.)</div>

<div class="content">I don't use NEO but will have a look at it.<br><br>Since I'm on pen and paper I handle this as follows:<br>I had setup folders in Outlook (work) and tags in Gmail (personal) like:<br>ol1_<br>ol2_<br>(in gmail: e1_, e2_, ...)<br>and so on (ol = outlook, e=gmail).<br>If I got a mail to which I want to respond later and need the mail as support material I put it in one of those folders (empty) and label the folder (e.g. ol2_HelpClark)<br>On my AF list I write for example:<br>OL2: reply to Clark Kent where to buy those fantastic protein drinks<br><br>Thus I know the mail is in OL2. If I got addition mails relating to this I put it also in this folder. If i had answered (finished) I delete the contend of the folder or move the folder to a folder called "4archive". An label the folder back to ol2_ (=thus I know its empty).<br><br>BTW I do the same on my harddisk and usb-device. There I have folders like:<br>2Action<br>-- s01<br>-- s02<br>-- and so on<br>(s = usb stick)<br>Thus, a task could look like:<br>ol2, s01: Mail Clark price list from BigMuscleStore (* in s01 could be a relating document).<br>=> this way I always find support material very quick.<br><br>- Jens</div>

<div class="content">I used to use a linking system (via Things on the Mac/iPhone) to associate tasks with the email messages that spawned them.  But now I've converted to paper for my SF3 list, so I use a different strategy.  Looking back, all the cool automated linking, tagging, syncing seems like more trouble than it was worth (and it did cost quite a few $$).<br><br>I try to manage email by following Merlin Mann's Inbox Zero guidelines (excellent video at <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925#)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925#).</a> I keep a sticker on my computer that says "d.a.qa.fta.ea" to remind me of the five choices for dealing with each message: (1) Delete, (2) Archive, (3) Quick-reply + Archive, (4) Forward (delegate) + Tickle (followup reminder) + Archive, or (5) Enter + Archive. These are listed in my preferred order. <br><br>Only in Choice 5 do I actually enter the task in my SF3 list. If I need to refer to the body of that email message, I put a date reminder on the task entry and/or print the message to keep in my Pending folder. Since I archive email into monthly mbox (text) files, it's relatively easy to find an old but important message and its associated conversation thread.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">I use Gmail.<br><br>If the mail can be replied to quickly, I do it.<br><br>If it contains a task, I enter it in my SF notebook (a large format Moleskine cahier). I may put "(em)" after it to remind me that the details are in email. So far, I've had no problem finding an email when I've needed it.<br><br>If I want to deal with the task/email later--such as tomorrow or next week or next month--I forward it to Goodtodo.com (I'm a subscriber). Goodtodo.com emails me a daily digest of what the day's tasks are.<br><br>Then the email is deleted or archived in a folder. I keep a Pre-Trash folder for certain items that will spoil after a while and not need to be archived.<br><br>I occasionally keep emails active in the inbox to remind me to get to them, but they tend to be reminders for something coming up the next day (I subscribe to memotome.com too!) or long responses I want to write to friends.</div>

<div class="content">Here is what I do, and I get a LOT of tasks via email.  I have a folder in Outlook 2010 entitled "E-Action Support".  I move the email that has a task in it to that folder.  I then immediately make an entry in my SF3 list for this task and put the following after the task:  (EAS).  The "E" of course is for Email Action Support folder.  I also have a regular "Action Support" folder on a file stand on my desk where I keep non-project related papers that come to my attention that need to be actioned.  I make the same kind of notation in my SF3 list, minus the "E".<br><br>I have found in the heat of the day that it is VERY important to make these entries into the SF3 list as soon as possible, if not immediately.  That way, urgent things don't get lost in the email.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>If you are using NEO, you can simply tag an email as a To Do with three levels of priority. It automatically appears in your To Do folder. Since there's no limit to the number of folders an email can be in, it can also be in one or more project folders.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I would love to be able to use NEO -- I checked it out on their website.  But our IT people have made it very clear that we cannot install any Outlook integration software.  Considering that I do not have Admin rights, I have to abide by their dictates.<br><br>Mark, I do hope you are feeling better.  Get plenty of rest...<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I don't use neo I am on a mac.  In column 1 I have a recurring task call "inbox" zero. When ever I hit it I do the following:<br><br>1. Delete any garbage emails that have accumulated since last time.<br>2. Anything needs filing goes in the 1 single reference folder I have. Search on the Mac Makes it unnecessary  in my world to use folders any longer. Search can find anything I need just as fast.<br>3. If an email needs action then. It gets written into column 1 or 2 as appropriate and filed in reference.<br>4. Emails that need a reply that hasn't yet been done by steps 1-3 go into a folder called column2. That folder is processed as the last page 2 of my notebook. All must be replied to or filed before I can go to page one of my book.<br><br>This has been totally effective.</div>

<div class="content">Bob,<br><br>I think I'll steal your column 2 idea. I have a bad habit of "quickly" replying to urgent mails as I go through the "process" folder rather than noting the action first. It ALWAYS takes longer than I expect.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks so much for the ideas in this thread!  I've currently been under a heavy load of work related email and I'll be implementing some of these.  Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to try NEO but some of the thoughts here have helped a great deal.</div>

<div class="content">I have a corporate IT issue too. I'm sure the following sounds more complicated than it looks but this is what I do using outlook if a simple "Reply Bob re Project 1" isn't enough:<br>o Turn the email into a task with attachment (right click drag over tasks, choose "Copy Here as Task With Attachment"<br>o Put a unique reference number in the task description (see below on how I do this)<br>o Add any notes in the task body and save<br>o Use the unique reference number in SF list to refer to this deferred email task<br>o Use "find" in outlook or use a desktop search to find the email again when you want to work on it.<br><br>How to make a unique reference number:<br>o Take the day's date eg: today = 21 Feb 2011<br>o Make it 110221 (ie: YYMMDD) <br>o Add a suffix to it for each unique number you want to create today -> What I do is on the last page of my list I write:<br>110221 A B C D E F G etc <br>and cross off the letter I have used (So if I have just used 110221A, I cross off A and know that the next letter available is B to make 110221B)<br>Then tomorrow I will start using 110222 and add suffixes A , B , C etc etc<br><br>Hope this is useful</div>
