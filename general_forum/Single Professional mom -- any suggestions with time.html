<div class="content">Looks like your post was a bit lost amongst some of the spam. <br>Or may be your bit.ly url was a bit intimidating. The full url is actually <a href="http://wendysuepov.blogspot.com/2010/08/5-children-professional-position-single.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://wendysuepov.blogspot.com/2010/08/5-children-professional-position-single.html</a> , that is the only blog post there. <br>Mmm ...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Wendy<br>I'd recommend 2 things. Mark's systems here are for managing tasks and deciding what to do next out of your to do list - look for the Autofocus index <a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/</a>  and try them all out. There are loads of practical and useful ideas in Mark's book Do It Tomorrow which is worth every penny.<br><br>Also, if you're running a home you need Flylady! Check out Flylady.net sign up for the emails <br>and start doing the Beginners Babysteps from the link on the Homepage. It will change your life.<br><br>Mark and Flylady have a lot in common in terms of the ideas that they recommend despite the fact that Mark is more focused on the work environment and Flylady is more focused on the home. <br><br>Taking the best ideas from both of them and continually learning from them both has changed my life. I used to read self help organisation books by the bucket load but none of them ever worked for me because they were written by born organised people who had no idea how us disorganised creative folks think!<br><br>Hope this helps!<br><br>Val</div>
