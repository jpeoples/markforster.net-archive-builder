<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">As others have reported, after several weeks with DWM, long enough for the initial one-month crunch to have been well past and processed, I have found that I have been allowing to fall over the waterfall some tasks that I do not feel I can allow to be dismissed.  I have also been afflicted by a sense of overwhelm, though whether that is a cause or effect of not keeping up with the list I'm not sure.<br><br>I have made a modification to DWM over which I have mixed feelings.  I am keeping the list in a spreadsheet based on Walter's design.  I have attached to each task a label denoting one of about a dozen areas: work, home, recreation, health & fitness, family and so on. Periodically I use Excel's ability to filter the tasks to just one category: for example, just the recreation items.  I then identify the three most important tasks from among them.<br><br>Subsequently, with all the categories showing, I can choose between displaying all the tasks, or just the tasks that I've identified as top in their categories.  Most of the time I have it in this latter view, and attend to just the top tasks; but I'm free to look at the list conventionally whenever I want to.<br><br>I feel good about this approach because it is giving me results I find more satisfactory.  In particular, a top-3 list of a dozen categories is a manageable 36 entries, rather than the overwhelming 450 in the full list.  In practice, I'm getting the top 3 things done in all categories, and a large proportion of the others are getting automatically discarded.<br><br>I feel uneasy about this approach, however, because it runs counter to Mark's caution against prioritisation.  One reason for considering that prioritisation doesn't work is that scrubbing the kitchen floor will never be a high priority task for most people, but if it and similar chores aren't performed once in a while, living conditions quickly degenerate into a slum.  I address that by having enough categories so that inescapable life-admin can achieve suitable priority in its own category, and so appear alongside work and other obligations in the shorter list.  Still, I have a nasty feeling I've slid half way to reinventing GTD. <br><br>May I record my deep sense of relief that the temporary unusability of this valuable forum may have come to an end, allowing me to seek reactions to this that are not dominated by over-long contributions from an under-long list of contributors.  Welcome back, cherished friend.</div>

<div class="content">I think Mark's books have done a great job in clarifying the problems with prioritisation and I agree with the core of that. Apart from that, I think we get bogged down into trying to prioritise things - when we intellectually try to determine priority we often weight them by the questionable criteria (unless we're very clear about our goals). I think the process in AF1 has been the most elegant and interesting way to arrive at choices that are balanced. But I don't think it's a full proof system. You can't rule out biases for certain tasks, especially when they are under the threshold of awareness. And secondly, choices are limited to what has been put on the list. And what you put on the list is subject to all kinds of criteria.<br><br>In that respect I think we need extra steering, or at least some of us (depends on our life style). I've had a similar dilemma to David's, but while using AF1 last year (I've since been using my own system). And that is having a list of things that are mixed together, related and unrelated can be confusing. I wanted to be able to filter down to certain area's when I wanted to. Similar to reading a menu, having the main courses, wine list and desserts all mixed in one long random list wasn't always practical to me. If I know I want a dessert, there's no need for me to pick the item between a list of main course items. But at the same time I love the process of picking what 'feels ready to be done'. <br><br>So my answer to that is so to sin a little differently and it's something I'm expanding a little more in more areas. I don't review entire lists, but rather I subdivide into categories. This is harder to do with dynamic lists on paper, but easier to do digitally. But what I've found in addition to that, is you can have static lists (list that don't continually introduce new items) and apply AF on those (which you can easily do on paper). So to give an example, if I have items ranging between 10 projects or areas, instead of reading through a list of items related to those in random order, I might pick the project using the AF method, by scanning and reviewing the list of projects and picking what feels 'ready to be acted upon'. Then I'll go to the sublist for that project. <br><br>Because it's unlikely that people are going to have pages full of projects, instead of using pages as closed lists, I shorten the rotation to something more suitable to the length of the list. If I just wanted to cycle through 12 projects or areas, I'd divide them into groups of 4 and treat those like how in AF1 one treats a page. You get a lot of the benefits of AF and it encourages balance (dismissing a project from time to time can free up a lot, btw!).<br><br>This has been my favourite adaptation resulting from trying AF and I think it achieves similar effects as David's approach here, or at least attempts to address a similar problem. One of my favorite experiments has been to apply AF to a list of meals/food I prepare at home. Because I often get stuck into eating things out of (a bad) habit or lack of imagination, applying AF can help enforce more variety and the urge to expand the list and widen the palette.</div>

<div class="content">I'm following a similar track Peter.  I can't recommend what's below, because I've just started to try this., but it seems like it could work.<br><br>All my work projects are getting grouped up, and my autofocus list is being condensed into mostly just projects.  There are details under each project, and managing those details is another conversation.  So for David's example, Housework is a project, and not an important one at that.  But following AF4 and grouping things up, I end up with a list of maybe 20 items, and run through the system.  Housework then may be neglected for a while, but after most of the other projects have been worked on and shifted to the open list, I must do the housework lest I dismiss it utterly.  (On the other hand I can do housework frequently if I choose; AF4 is very flexible this way.)</div>
