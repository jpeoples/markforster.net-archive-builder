<div class="content">Since July 1st, I've been following DIT pretty much as written.   That's about 7 months.  I thought I'd write a little about my experience with it.<br><br>I have fallen behind and declared a "backlog" six or seven times.   The third time this happened, I employed the full-blown "audit your commitments" routine described in the DIT book.  It was very enlightening and very helpful, and significantly and permanently reduced the number of tasks on my list.   Subsequent backlogs always had a specific, temporary external cause, so I haven't done the complete audit each time.   But it sure was worthwhile, and freed me up to really focus on what's important.   <br><br>I have taken to writing the critical recurring items in the first 8-9 lines of each day's page, followed by the ordinary one-off and project tasks, and less-critical recurring items.   By "critical" items I mean the things that will really create chaos if I don't attend to them regularly, like clearing my inbox, listening to my voicemail, and reviewing my calendar.   These are regular, standard maintenance items, but if they ever fall behind, the rest of the system falls apart.   I like keeping them set apart a little from everything else.   Other recurring items, like "professional background reading", just goes on the regular task list with everything else.   If I fall behind a bit, it's not a big deal, and doesn't generate chaos.<br><br>Other than that, there's not much to say.   DIT works so nicely for me because it takes Gerry's 80% rule ("write everything in one place"), adds a minimal bit of structure ("write everything on tomorrow's page in a daily journal"), and gives me a way to regulate my total workflow, prioritize my commitments, and stay on top of everything.   It's very simple, has no insistent rules that create resistance to the system, and just enough structure to help me focus on what's really important.   It is always a relief to just turn to my DIT book and get started working through it -- I always know I'm going to get something meaningful done and stay on top of the mundane details.<br><br>And I still keep finding new and fresh nuggets while re-reading the Do It Tomorrow book.   I just wish the the book were available on Kindle so I could put it on my iPhone.   :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Great testimony, and congratulations on your success with DIT. The good news is that Hodder's are supposed to be producing an electronic version of the book; the bad news is that they seem to be moving at a snail's pace (perhaps they should read the book and not just publish it!).</div>

<div class="content">LOL!<br><br>Thanks, Mark, for inventing the system!   :-)</div>

<div class="content">Wild! On Friday, same day that Seraphim posted this, I pulled out my DIT book and went back to that system. There is something so comforting about it.<br><br>But since I first got that book and started my Forster journey, I've moved to electronic books for non fiction. I was so wishing DIT came in an electronic form for highlighting and bookmarking.<br><br>I'll buy it as soon Hodder's gets it out.<br><br>Thanks Seraphim for the post.</div>
