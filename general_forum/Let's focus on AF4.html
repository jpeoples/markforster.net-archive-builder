<div class="content">This has been a very productive forum where, working and testing together, Mark's creation has improved dramatically. A number of us (I guess many more than actually write on the forum) are happily using AF4. I suspect there are still useful improvements ahead of us, and this needs analysis of the tweaks and adaptations that people are making to it.<br><br>I myself am using it exactly as Mark defined, and it seems to work better as time goes on.<br><br>I'll give an example of one issue. When a list gets long, one can get bogged down in the closed list. One can also get bogged down in the open list. Possible adaptation: at the start of the day, move to whichever section of the list you were not on the previous day.<br><br>Another issue which many face is handling tasks which apply in different locations. I myself am happy using a single handwritten notebook, but I think this issue will only be satisfactorily sorted with software. I believe in embracing technology wherever it is helpful, and this is likely to be one such case.<br><br>I am hoping that the synergy of people and ideas here will continue to help Mark and the rest of us to push this unique project forward, though should it have to stay at its current stasis I am still very thankful.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence,<br><br>I am another satisfied AF4 customer. I recently posted about how I use AF4, with time-sensitive recurrent items that I do not like to put on my calendar. <br><br>With previous incarnations of AF, I was quite meticulous about marking my location at the end of each workday, so that I knew precisely where to start the next day. With AF4, I am much more lackadaisical. More often than not, I just start my day at the very top of the closed list, that is, on the oldest page that still has an open item.</div>

<div class="content">I agree a list can get bogged you bogged down if it's too long.  My suggestion is to actively dismiss tasks when that gets to be a problem.  Dismiss tasks that you really don't intend to work on soon.  <br><br>Dismiss means either redefine the task and put into the open list, or delete it.  Instead of deleting, you might put the task into a tickler for later reminder.</div>

<div class="content">Alan: What you suggest reads like a reframing of the AF4 marking for review, but in a more flexible light. I feel there is an important insight here, but at the same time I think for me it might lead to the loss of some important but not urgent tasks, or move the problem into an ever growing tickler file.<br><br>Maybe there can be an additional process for tasks which are not to be done soon, which retains them while at the same time making the structure more fluid?</div>

<div class="content">I am also a very satisfied customer with AF4. After many weeks of working with it i admit that I dont need to tweak it. The only thing i must do is a morning process wich is very simple and clear<br>1. Read all the list <br>2. Eliminate or report future tasks (over one week)<br>3 Put a little red dash in front of all urgent items and do it first. <br>That's all. <br>Then i begin with what I must do and when this is finished i work i usual in AF4 Way and it works perfectly well. I dont need any other review. I just need to take some time during the day to plan and work on some of my complicated project and report what must be done on AF4. The result is that the system clears everything little by little and all my important and urgent stuff is done first. I don't even need omnifocus i used, a good tikler, a diary or a simple sheelt of paper use as a ticker is absolutly perfect for me. <br>There is also a secret feeling in AF4 I wana share with you. The feeling of control everything. <br>I only kept from GTD my list of project but i could include it in AF4 with a sentence such as work on project XXX. What is amazing is that AF4 began to work indeed perfectly with me sence i stop writing on a A4 note book for a pocket note book i can bring everywhere 11x17 cm-yes it's small but it's great because i can throw on it everything i think about and let AF4 sort it on the flow. AF4 is realy incredible.</div>
