<div class="content">To those who found my AF Advance tweak interesting:<br><br>Don't adopt it yet!<br><br>A nagging feeling I had that the "barrier position" in that system is an important parameter which might need tuning for optimal performance---was in fact a sign that the system isn't done yet. I now think that the system as described is missing a rule.<br><br>Since I also decided not to adopt Mark's new SFv3 at this time, some variations of the "missing rule" will have a chance to get tested over next few weeks.</div>
