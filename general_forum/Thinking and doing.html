<div class="content">There is a passage in The Reader, the popular novel by Bernhard Schlink, that recently reminded me of Autofocus, especially what Mark Forster has said about striking a balance between the rational and intuitive parts of your mind: <br><br>"...today I can recognize that events back then were part of a lifelong pattern in which thinking and doing have either come together or failed to come together -- I think, I reach a conclusion, I turn the conclusion into a decision, and then I discover that acting on the decision is something else entirely, and that doing so may proceed from the decision, but then again it may not. Often enough in my life I have done things I had not decided to do...I don't mean to say that thinking and reaching decisions have no influence on behavior. But behavior does not merely enact whatever has already been thought through and decided. It has its own sources, and is my behavior, quite independently, just as my thoughts are my thoughts, and my decisions my decisions."</div>

<div class="content">This is so true!  I have observed this in my life and in others.  I was only able to move forward with a (different) major at university after thinking thru and deciding once and for all that I would go into optometry.<br><br>Another time, a friend was trying to decide between staying at her job or moving to an enticing new one.  She kept going back and forth on the pros and cons.  Pretty much everyone was telling her to stay at her current job, but she couldn't make up her mind.  Finally I said, Here, I'll be the one to tell you - Take the new job!  And I laid out all the reasons she should.  I'm not sure she'll see it that way, but I think I removed the roadblock in her mind.  The next day she told the new job she wasn't interested.<br><br>On a simpler level, when people flip coins I think sometimes it is to "try on" a decision.  Then half the time they say, "no no" when it's heads for chinese, let's really do pizza instead.</div>
