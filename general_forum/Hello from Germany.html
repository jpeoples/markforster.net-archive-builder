<div class="content">Hello everybody,<br><br>as it´s not so easy for me (as a German AF-Tester) to answer to your comments in English I decided, that it´s at least the time to introduce myself to all of you.<br><br>First of all I would like to thank you all for the huge amount of insights I get, reading your posts here in this forum. I have no problems, reading English and translating it into German but when it gets to answering direct in English I feel a lot of resistance in me (even if it´s only the fear, to make mistakes...)<br><br>So I would like to start the fight against this fear by writing this first post here. Well, to be honest: There´s an item "Post to AF-forum" in my list and today I felt that the time has come to do so.... ;-)<br><br>I work in an office, live with a great familiy (wife and two children of 7 and 14 years) and have some other hobbies as playing music and dancing so that there are always lots of items to fill my lists. Today is day 2 of my AF-Experience and I´m really feeling good with it. But I´m not shure if it would be the same without Mark and you all, who already gave a lot of answers to questions that come around, working with my lists (two in fact, 1 @ work and 1 @ home).<br><br>It is very motivating for me, to know, that you are here around nearly all the time ;-) and help each other to really manage the first few days and weeks until the new system is really established in everyones life, who decided to give it a try. Tanks again.<br><br>Ok, this is enough to cross this item from my list, I think ;-)<br>but I promise to write another task at the end of my list "Post first thoughts about AF to the forum"<br><br>Happy to have you all near by me<br><br>Michael</div>

<div class="content">Wow Michael - if that's the way you can write in English you REALLY do not need to worry!  If you look at the number of mistakes in my posts - and my keyboard will keep changing I to i - you would see you have no reason to worry.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Michael, don't worry about your English - it is not as bad as you might think and this forum is about content, not about language skills. As along as readers understand what you mean it's just fine.<br>Regards from another German time management enthusiast</div>
