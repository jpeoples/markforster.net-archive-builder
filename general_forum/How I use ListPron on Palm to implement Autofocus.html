<div class="content">The Auto Focus system promises to help me clear my back log of ever increasing lists of things to do.   After reading some posts about ListPro I thought I would share my setup to help others and get feedback.<br><br>ListPro set up. These are the fields:<br><br>Done   (Checkbox)<br>Item   (String)<br>Category (Category - contains values  HOME OFFICE LUNCHTIME DISMISSED)<br>Pageid   (Category)<br>DueDate  (Date)<br>DateAdded (Date) - set to automatically enter today's date - helps keep track of the<br>age of tasks and to identify areas of procrastination<br><br>At the end of each week I update the Pageid value to group the<br>remaining items.  After the first week of using the system I sorted<br>the list by PageId then entered 1 into the field.  After the second<br>week, the list whould show 1 and blank, so the blank fields are<br>updated to 2.  Hopefully you get the idea!<br><br>I have annotated the Quick Start guide from the web site to show the steps....<br><br>The system consists of one long list of everything that you have to<br>do, written in a ruled notebook (25-35 lines to a page ideal).  The Listpro<br>equivalent is one long list with a "Date Added" field to show the creation sequence<br>The PageId field is used to logically group items into weekly<br>pages. This is a manual step done each week (described later)<br><br>As I think of new items, I add them to the end of the list. <br>by entering a new item in Listpro, filling in the Item field with details and<br>choosing the category (HOME for things to do at home, WORK for things<br>to do at the office and LUNCHTIME for errands). The category<br>effectively creates the separate lists for home and work.<br><br>You work through the list one page at a time in the following<br>manner. <br><br>1. Read quickly through all the items on the page without taking action on any of them. <br> Listpro: The current page is displayed by choosing the Filter option<br> and choosing the value of blank. Otherwise work through the page<br> numbers in the file.<br><br>The category field can also be filtered if focusing on home or work. <br><br>Go through the page more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you.   [Listpro - scroll using Item View or LIst view for the bigger picture]<br><br>3. Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so <br><br>4. Cross the item off the list, and re-enter it at the end of the list if you haven't finished it. <br><br>Listpro. If I have finished the task, click the Done checkbox, otherwise remove the page number to move the task to the latest page.<br><br>5. Continue going round the same page in the same way. Don't move onto  the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out.<br><br>6. Move onto the next page and repeat the process. [Listpro - choose the next page number in the Filtered View]<br><br>7. If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first<br>pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are<br>dismissed without re-entering them. (N.B. This does not apply to<br>the final page, on which you are still writing items).    [Manually change<br>the category to DISMISSED.  Alternatively I can just delete the items but then all trace<br>is lost!<br><br>8. Once you've finished with the final page, re-start at the first page that is still active.<br>For Listpro, the first active page is the page with the lowest page number.  Completed pages will be removed (archived) from the file.<br><br>The Listpro approach has some benefits:<br><br>If a task needs to be done today or on a particular day, I schedule<br>the item by choosing a date in the due date field.<br><br>Different ways to Work the list<br><br>- Check what needs to be done today:<br>Filter the view to show all categories and choose today's date.<br><br>- Check what other things that can be done in this context (work or<br>home): Filter the view to show specific category and optionally a page<br>(current or previous).<br><br>- Review a page:  Filter the view to show a specific page but all<br>categories.<br><br>Weekly maintenance.<br><br>Each week I review the list using the Desktop version of ListPro. Checked items are deleted, and the page numbers for the current week are updated to the next available number.  If most items of work have been completed, this task should not take long.<br>Deleted items are exported and archived.<br><br>Multiple AF "books"<br><br>A separate task diary is recommended for work and home, or any other<br>major component of your life.  I consider this equivalent to the GTD<br>concept of "contexts". I use the Categroy field to identify tasks to do at the<br>office, errands during lunch breaks, home, and reading. Assigning tags<br>allows faster review of items.<br></div>
