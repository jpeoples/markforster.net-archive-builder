<div class="content">There is something I would never understand. Why life can become so complicated and make you do things you did'nt want to do and even you wanted to avoid at any price...<br><br>I wrote I was happy with AF4 and sure all was ok. Then suddenly the numbers of projects task became so important than it was indeed impossible to stay with my paper or my digital MF system. <br><br>I had to see all my project at a glance, think and plan a strategy about them but also make them advance one by one. Of course I loved and still love AF4 but i am like in a storm these times and AF4 is unable to make me treat my projects one by one and in it all parts. Even if except if for action it is the best system I never had. <br><br>So I went back to GTD because GTD has a global approach of things and after 5 years practicing it more or less it is the only system that make me feel quiet and peaceful. But I still read the forum and like to participate and see how people try to manage their life in a world which becomes little by little indeed complicated. <br><br>So, as I promised, I come back to you to explain how i evaluate myself. <br><br>So here is what I did. I dont have any note book any more. I keep GTD & Omnifocus as my central system. It collects everything, it manage my important emails, it collects my ideas in the inbox where ever I am (I have it on my iphone) It manage my projects globally and step focus, when I take time to Analyze my stuff it help me to structure my ideas even to link on task my heuristic schemes. <br><br>I can tell you that I follow GTD rules most of the time. I put all my projects, tasks, ideas, notes and so on, on omnifocus, I follow the GTD collect, process, organize, review, do precepts, I plan my horizons, I work by contexts which are @Call, @Macintosh, @Office, @Home, @Everywhere, @Errands, @Speak with, @Read, @Review, @Wait from others, @Frozen, @Someday-Maybe, @Info. <br><br>The system works well because about projects, tasks or horizon I can manage my littles notes, Review my stuff regularly and do things at the right time. <br><br>I notice that GTD give me a sens of control, a global view, a project list but context are great to do things ASAP. But for the rush of the day AF1 is still much better and much pleasant to work on. <br><br>But during the day I keep on my desk 4 paper sheet: They are my bigs rocks.<br><br>-  One is about my hot projects (building I am negotiating, New opportunity of business)<br>-  One is about project I have to work on (Project on the flow) = list of project indeed necessary to make advance my hot projects or very binding project ie Tax...)<br><br>- One is about thinking project = project i have to think about<br><br>If I new project happen I just take notes about it on a paper page. and drop it In my inbox if I want tio treat it later or tomorrow. If it is a simple task I just put it on my OF in box thanks to a shorcut. It is very fast. I have have to do it now less to 2 mn and can do it, I do it immediately. <br><br>- My last page is a AF1 page. But a special one. <br>It contains nothing but the most important task i planed and was able to to yesterday night. They are extracted from Omnifocus project. This list is like a map of the day. May be I shall add things on it by the day but only if I need to do Today. <br><br>At the end of the day during my daily review I take time to report the tasks on OF and organize them in my project list. <br><br>During the day I just look a a glance on the list. <br>I Look at it BY PROJECT or BY CONTEXT. <br><br>For example : If something stand at me I do it. And look at the project on OF when I am finished wondering if there is anything else to do. If No I follow the list. Then when the list is finished or if I feel it I just look at a glance to my context list. <br><br>ie imagine i wrote yesterday work on project X and Call mr Smith. I work on it looking on my project list on omnifocus. <br><br>Imagine their is nothing which stand at me on AF4 but I feel in the mood of calling people. I just look on my OF context list @Call and do them immediately. Them I will be back on AF list and see at a glance if I did all my calls of the day. <br><br>Then to summarize. I centralized all on Omnifocus.<br>I use the collect and GTD proces. I use AF only for the most important task I must do today and get rid of the list when it is done. I make a fast daily review at night Process, analyze, review and eliminate tasks, plan my project, takes notes in fact do waterer is necessary about my projects. I report on a blank paper new sheet my map of the day which will be my guide. <br><br>I Now all this is not very AF but you will be please to hear that reading things i still use the double reading which stand at me some tasks wherever they are. <br><br>Good WE to all.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter - nice to hear from you again, and very interesting to hear what system you're using now.  It's funny how people (me included) choose a certain system to use, but when circumstances change they switch to a different system.  I love DWM and DWM2,  and Ive just started using Superfocus, but when I hit a day when I have a lot of urgent stuff to do, I like to use the 3-task method.  Once things have calmed down I go back to whatever I was using.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter and Margaret,<br><br>Yes, interesting.  For all of us, and this is reflected in your posts, the most important thing is what works for us as individuals.<br><br>Like other forum members I like hearing about others' experiences.  Some are interesting and make me experiment, others I dismiss.<br><br>GTD got me really interested in 2005 to find a workable solution to time and task management.  It was good, but then I found the sheer overhead too muc, with and without digital help.<br><br>But it works for Jupiter and that's good.  Margaret's comment about using different techniques at different times is a good one.  I also shift towards 3T in similar circumstances, and with BIG tasks looming I sometimes deploy the salami technique with a kitchen timer to get the momentum going.</div>

<div class="content">Systems are TOOLS with strong and weak points!<br><br>If you want to master the art of Time Management, you have to understand those points and be comfortable with changing from one to another. Look at chefs; they have a number of knives to choose from. All do the same thing: cut. And for most of us, there is no real difference and we see the difference in shape as an interesting point.  But each of them is best suited for a specific purpose and the function is directly linked with it's shape. So what is an oddity to most people is a vital knowledge for Chefs...<br><br>Don't let the tools master you; master the tools!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Margaret nice to hear from you again like Roger, Erik and all. It it so interesting to read all the post of this forum and i must admit i am quiet addictive with it !.<br><br>When I began my research about the best organization which could work for me I didn't realized the point you mentioned. Yes organization is not frozen for ever. Life is so complicated and evaluate so fast that some tools works for some time and for a while and others are still working for parts of and for some time too. <br><br>So I understood that when i wrote in this forum that i was so enthusiastic about a system i could change my mind from one day to another and accept to start again at the beginning. <br><br>But I think, for the moment (lol) that whatever you use, and suits to you at the moment, there are some fundamental rules to respect. I didn't think about them especially but here are some of them I think about for the moment. <br><br>I would be very happy all of you would complete this list. <br>May be we could advance and find for each one an evaluating organization which stuck to constantly moving reality. <br><br>All is axed on to principle : on is the CONTROL the other is the altitude (PERSPECTIVE). This is GTD. <br><br>1. Collect your stuff,<br>2. List your projects which are activable or not. <br>3. Take some time to work on the active one and decide what is the best to do about them and when.<br>4. Take altitude about your life, your project, your action. See what you really want to do and if it is worth too. <br>5. Make a system which alouds you to collect items wether they are actionable or not. <br>6. Remember that you multipliate your efficiency working with others. So try to delegate and control this delation the most you can do. <br>7. Remember that all system you chose is created and maked for ACTING. So action is the result you must target and do first at all even if your system is a wash out. <br>8. Use your intuition. Double reading, AF reading with items which stand at you are essential to choose your action. David allen says use your intuition. I am convinced that it is more than this. Just be sure that every action you do is the best action you have to do at this moment.<br>9. Be creative and courageous. Don't be afraid to target the moon. Imagin, inovate, dont stuck to the old rules, use your real personality and show you like you are, accept that some time you can fall (we are all human). Some time we bring a little to others, some time a lot, never mind the purpous is to bring something until we die.</div>

<div class="content">I think this is very good Jupiter. I believe there are general principles that we need to keep in mind and this list is a good start. Some that I would emphasize:<br>1 write everything down<br>2 understand what matters<br>3 actually do<br>4 control the system. Each system provides rules and choices. Use your own understanding to make choices that work for you, and if the rules don't work, adapt. <br>Personally I found GTD was a struggle to manage and to apply. On the other side, AF doesn't provide the organization that can often help.  But AF works well with a system of organizing, and I see you are doing that now.  If it works well, Great!</div>

<div class="content">I would add:<br><br>Define what Done means for each project and each step. The act of defining can be a task.<br><br>Rate the system by your confidence it gives you and the progress you make on the rest of your life, not by the time it takes to maintain it.<br><br>Accept that some days and weeks you won't be able to run the system. You will be away, have emergencies, and have very busy days. The system needs to handle that.<br><br>Dismantle old systems gradually. Let the new system expand and take over the old material naturally. Mark does that by declaring the old system to be a backlog, and you bring over one shelf / folder / concept at a time. GTD throws the entire old system into one messy pile that leaves you system-less until it's sorted out.<br><br>Encourage life balance.<br><br>Accept that as life changes, your system needs to change.</div>
