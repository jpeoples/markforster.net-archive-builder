<div class="content">Some have indicated that Mark's new system would play nice with electronics. Here's what I may try via Omnifocus (I own the software and app):<br><br>All new tasks get a "next month" due date (the software provides the date)<br>All repeating tasks get a "next week" due date<br>Certain tasks need a start date - for ex: clt reciepts require the day I saw the clt - this is easy to do in Omni. <br><br>Anyone else?</div>

<div class="content">Quick question: <br><br>Is there a way to have Omnifocus automatically sort/organize my tasks by due date? I can do this manually, but I'd prefer if this happens automatically.</div>

<div class="content">I'm doing this electronically using excel. Sorting by "Expiry date." So far so good. The only thing I miss is an autohotkey to pop up a form for entering tasks? Anyone know how to do this?</div>

<div class="content">I've got Mark's new system working on my iPhone and Mac. Sweet. <br><br>I've been using paper - with good results - for AF4 for the past couple of weeks. I enjoy the organic feel of paper. However, the lack of: <br><br>* search<br>* contexts/projects<br>* field for notes<br>* portability (yes paper is portable, but not nearly as portable as my iPhone)<br><br>made my return to electronics an easy choice. We'll see how long this lasts.</div>

<div class="content">You don't really have to just keep sorting since every new task goes into the future (+7 or +30). So I work the list until I get to the end (first new item) then I filter out completes, resort, and work from the top again.</div>

<div class="content">Vegheadjones - can you put a shortcut to the file in your status bar? Then you'd just click the shorcut to open it (and leave it open and use alt-tab to go back and forth between open files). Instead of sorting out the completes, I'm moving them to a "done" tab in the same spreadsheet - still easily accessible if I need them, but not in the way otherwise. I'll do the same thing next week for the dismissed items.<br><br>I didn't want to have weekend dates, so I set up my spreadsheet where I enter today's date (input date in column A) and mark it as a New or Continued (N or C in column B) and an 'if' formula in column C to calculate the Expired Date ( if N, then input date + 28, if not, input date +7) Column D has the description. 28 days is close enough to one month and it avoids weekends which could happen with 30 days.</div>

<div class="content">Okay, I've just started transitioning my AF4 list (in Lotus Notes ToDo synced with Outlook Mobile Tasks) into AF5/DIT2. Here's what I did and will do ...<br>(1) I was already using the task list sorted by due-date, where due-date was when I entered the tasks, now that need to change a bit.<br>(2) Re-entered tasks to use due-date as today+7. <br>(3) Totally new tasks to use due-date as today+30.<br>(4) I'll leave old uncompleted AF4 tasks at previous due-date, changing due-date to today+7 only for tasks that are still relevant. ;-)<br>(5) Add a marker task ">>>Today>>>" with today's due date, denoting expiry/dismissal of older tasks. I'll update it each day I work AF5/DIT2.<br>(6) Add a marker task "---Starting-AF5/DIT2---" with due date 2feb10.  <br>... I think that's it ... now to go work AF5/DIT2 ...</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Lilian for the shortcut idea, and thanks for sharing your column headings-- it prompted me to do the same.<br><br>A: Time started. I use this to indicate what task I am working on now and because I like to track the time spent on task. I made a macro that does the formula =today() and pastes it as a value.<br><br>B: Expiry date-- two macros, one for today+30 and one that copies a task and does today+7 since it is in progress. Again both paste the formulas as values<br><br>C: Days left-- (ColumnB-Today) value pasted<br><br>D: Task name<br><br>E: Time ended. =Now()- column A<br><br>f: Time spent on task Column E- Column A<br><br>g: Hyperlink (the reason why I moved from paper to digital)<br><br>That's it!</div>

<div class="content">I'm using Tadalist (tadalist.com) which allows for multiple lists.  Our company operates on workweeks (this is ww06) so each week I will add new items to a list that is three weeks away.  For example today I am adding to a list titled "ww09".  This will give me four lists at a time.<br><br>I'm used to working in weekly buckets so it feels like this will work well - seeing what will expire in each week and getting a sense of how long things have gone undone.</div>

<div class="content">OK, despite my initial dismissal of AF5 (pun intended), I'm going to test this out in Microsoft Outlook Tasks.<br><br>1. I've taken all my open tasks and put them in Outlook with a Due Date of March 2 (1 month from today).<br><br>2. I've setup a Tasks view to Group based on Due Date, Sort based on Creation time.  I added an Automatic Formatting rule to underline any tasks whose "Due Date" is "on or before" "today".  Once I get the hang of it I will probably update the view to filter out tasks that were due before today (i.e. dead, gone, buried).<br><br>So I see my tasks grouped by Date (right now, all I see is 85 tasks on March 2).  As I go round that list and work them, I will modify them by resetting the due date to 1 week from now (Feb 9).  Then I will have 2 lists that I collapse and expand to simulate turning of pages.<br><br>A nice feature of Outlook is that I can just type over the existing Due Date with the phrase "1 week" and Outlook will automatically set the due date for 1 week later.  Same for "1 month".<br><br>I also use a colored Categories to denote GTD contexts, but that's just my own personal preference.</div>

<div class="content">Actually I found this new DIT/AF system to be very compatible with mobile time management/calendar software such as Pocket Informant for Blackberry OS (which is what I use).  The nitty gritty of my current setup is below, but in brief, what happens is<br><br>1) Every new task is automatically due 30 days (or, as I use it, 28 days) from the time I enter the said task<br><br>2) The tasks are listed chronologically: the tasks due nearer today are above the others.<br><br>3) (Now this is what I found really interesting) I can with two presses of a button set the due date of a task today so that I can highlight what I need to do; then with another few presses of a button, make its new due date one week from now. <br><br>4) Surprisingly, new tasks without any due or starting date are automatically relegated to the bottom of the heap;  I therefore have a default way of listing "waiting for / something pending" tasks.<br><br>5) For my own edit of this new system, I can also with a few presses of a button to change the due date of a task /Tomorrow/, and change its priority.  I can therefore set up what I think would be the most important thing to do tomorrow (reminiscent of the "Current Initiative" idea in the original DIT).<br><br><br>Mark, it seems you made this new system exactly for me and my phone.  I thank you very heartily ^_____________^<br><br><br>So here are the details of my settings:<br><br>1) In Options --> Tasks<br>    a) setup <New Task Default Dates>  to "Start (Days from Today): 0" (This is so that the tasks show up in the "Today" view)<br>    b) setup <New Task Default Dates>  to "End (Days from Start): 30"  (NOTE: I use 28 for this value so that the start and end days fall on the same day of the week)<br>    c) setup <Sort Order> to "Date, Priority, Subject"<br>    d) check the <Ascending Date sort> box<br><br>2) New tasks are now automatically set as due 30 days (or in my case 28 days) from now<br><br>3) Upon doing a task, use "Menu -> Make due date today."  This sets the task to the very top of the list, thus highlighting it.<br><br>4) When this task is recurrent/to be re-entered, use "Menu -> Move Task -> + Week" to  move its new due date a week from now.<br><br>5) When entering a task that has a prerequisite event to happen first, remove the checks from the "Start Date" and "End Date" boxes. <br><br>^__________^</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>"Is there a way to have Omnifocus automatically sort/organize my tasks by due date?

You do know that OF supports syncing of perspectives nowadays? This is what made my own GTD+AF4-ish implementation finally work. I just use one perspective in which all the task are sorted by 'Changed', meaning that I have the tasks in the order they are entered (or re-entered if I have worked on them). Incidentally the perspective is called 'Autofocus' ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I'm using MLO for my tech implement, and so far its pretty cool.  Input parsing allows you to quickly enter tasks with due dates. Eg: The input "Call Jim in 30 days" is converted to Call Jim with a due date 30 days from now. <br><br>Arrange by due date, and presto, you got a nice lookin' DWM list, something similar to the Pocket Informant set up described here. I am looking forward to the BB version of MLO that will sync the desktop with my device. Then I'll be really cookin' :)<br><br>I've always enjoyed AF only on paper, but an electronic implement feels better for DWM. I worry about missing the tactile feel, so I am maintaining a mirror paper version for now. If all goes well, I expect I will print out my list during the workday for the paper feel, and list any quick entries there to be transferred later.</div>

Unfortunately OF doesn't support reverse sorting as far I know. But I personally don't mind whether the newest ones are on top or bottom as long as they are consistently so on both Mac and iPhone. The main point is that with perspectives you can sort by any OF criterion: Added, Changed, Start, Due etc. so they should work very well with AF and DWM. Note that I think that one should use only one perspective i.e. one list to work from.</div>

<div class="content">I'd like to point out one of Mark's insights: all lists are closed except one week and one month from today.  I'm finding this helpful in laying out my tasks in OneNote, and spreadsheet users might value the same.  That is, I leave space after the seventh day to write new stuff in.</div>

<div class="content">Very similar.  Right now I am experimenting without the Due Date grouping and instead using Due Date sort asc and Created sort asc.<br><br>This helps me reinforce the idea of "one long list" that Mark clarified. But I can switch back and forth when the grouping is appropriate.  <br><br>I will probably create a filter to remove tasks with Due date before today, then create another view to show the Task Graveyard (not complete, due date before today).<br><br>I've also reduced my Due Date changing method to "1w" and "1mo".  I found the hard way that "1m" means 1 minute, and the due date doesn't change. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I've created an Excel spreadsheet to try Mark's latest. The spreadsheet has 4 tabs - Active, Completed, Expired, and Calendar.

Excel 2007 may hesitate to open because of the macros, but the macros are very innocuous and only manipulate date in the spreadsheet. If you can't open the 2007, try the 97-2003.

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>I liked your idea of marking the current task in the list with an auto-format rule.  However, to keep the system as simple as possible and syncable to my windows mobile phone (w/ Pocket Informant), I used the Outlook Importance field to mark the current task as Low.  It gives a nice blue arrow pointing down the list, as if to say, from here downward.  Avoids the custom-checkbox field, as long as you don't really use Outlook Importance for true priorities/importance.  And be sure you're not sorting your list by Importance, otherwise your current task will jump around in the list.</div>

Toodledo sync is probably blocked by your company's firewall.

<div class="content">Similar to "dismissed" tasks in AF4, I intend to both "mark completed" and "category: dismiss" the "expired" tasks in DWM. No need for special dated filters (not available in WM Outlook Tasks), the active tasks filter is sufficient.</div>

<div class="content">isd,<br><br>If you are at all interested in voice recognition and use the iPhone, try ReQall.  They have a free version of the app which should tell you if it would work.  But, if you are not familiar with it, it will scan a voice note on their web server and send it back to your iPhone as text.  But more, they will parse it according to a very few rules and tag the note accordingly. (For example if you say "Buy Milk" it will put "Milk" on a "shopping list".  The paid version is more powerful but  if the free version won't do it for you then no point in going on ;-)<br><br>What you ought to be able to do is say the date ("Get new shoes next month") and it should tag it for a month from now.  Then say ("Get new shoes next week") to have it re-add as per the DWM rules.  That should give you the groupings necessary.  I've not tried it yet so I can't say how well it will work.  I have on my DWM list "Try ReQall for DWM"  ROTF ;-)</div>

<div class="content">No problem. What I also like about Omnifocus is that you can set a "Start Date"  for when you want tasks to appear. I use this to hide a lot of repetitive/routine tasks because I can't see the point in letting them clutter up the list; to me, that's a big advantage compared to working DWM on paper.<br><br>I tried setting up DWM in Appigo Todo, but without the "start date" feature, routine tasks just cluttered things up.</div>

<div class="content">I am not a paperphobe and so I use paper as my primary DWM notebook.  I do like to have a copy in electronic form on the iPhone so I can do various sorts.  I have played with various apps and the one I found most flexible is Toodledo.  (Thanks Mel ;-)  Here is how I use it, in case anyone is interested.<br><br>1) I set the default date for new tasks to be one month.  When I complete a task I mark it done with one click.  If it is not complete, I change the "Due Date" to "Next Week" with a two clicks.<br><br>2) There is a bulk entry ability and I used that to enter everything in my book into the program.<br><br>3) Once I had the tasks in the program, I set up some "Folders".  "Folders" mean "Projects" so me.  So while I may have a bunch of tasks scattered over the list about fixing the computers, I put them all in a "Computers" folder and I can look at just those when I am doing that project.<br><br>4) For those of you who like "Contexts", it has those as well.<br><br>5) You can also "Tag" tasks anyway you like.  There is no practical limit to the number of tags you can use on a task.<br><br>6) I found that I can put "Events" and tasks with strict deadlines into the list simply by setting a "Start Date" to the same date as the "Due Date".  They then won't appear until that date.  (Unless you want them to.)<br><br>7) You can attach notes to tasks which allows putting Projects in as tasks with specific steps as notes.  This can eliminate lots of clutter from the list.<br><br>8) Pocket Informant will sync with Toodledo, but I don't like that it does not give me access to Folders.<br><br>9) There is an iPhone app you can get but I have so far opted not to do that because ...<br><br>10) I can access my list via the Safari browser from the iPhone and it is excellent.  If I'm out of cell phone signal access, I can always fall back on PI which I still keep synced.  But that almost never happens.<br><br>11) There is an add-in for Firefox (and most other browsers).  It looks exactly like the iPhone web access screen.  Very nice if you are working on the computer most of the day.<br><br>12) I have not explored the gazillion other ways to access it (Twiter, eMail, etc.)<br><br>13) You can import and export in CSV and Text formats.  There is a one button export to Excel, for example, if you want to keep other kinds of information, such as statistics.<br><br>14) You can share tasks with others in a number of ways.<br><br>15) It has the ability to print one of those Origami pocket books.  You know, where you cut and fold it up to make a letter size sheet to be the size of a postage stamp?  ;-)<br><br>There are other features such as priority and such.  It even calculates an "Importance" number which uses a formula considering priority, number of days until due, etc.<br><br>All in all, the combination of Toodledo and the iPhone is almost perfect.  Of course, I STILL enter my information into my paper book FIRST.  It is still faster to do it that way.  At least for me.  And I am completely sure that my paper won't suddenly start costing me big bucks because the business model was not proving profitable ;-)<br><br>Oh, and it is FREE!  Unless you want some of the Cadillac features, such as sub-tasks and file storage.</div>

Sounds like DWM + Toodledo is a good combo. <br><br>I'd really like to find a way to do DWM in Outlook, since that's where all my work "lives".  I especially like the ability in Microsoft OneNote 2007 to flag a sentence as a task, and then it shows up automatically in Outlook.

<div class="content">I am a inveterate fiddler, and so I've been trying AF and DWM both on paper and electronically, using Palm Tasks, LIfe Balance, OmniFocus, Toodledo, Bonsai, and one more that I want to share with you:: Google Tasks. If you have Gmail or any Google Account, you can use the Tasks feature to list the tasks, and you can see the list separately at:<br> <a href="http://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas" rel="nofollow">http://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas</a><br><br>Anyway, if you click on Sort by Due Date, you get a very nice DWM style list with each date as a separate heading, similar to a paper page (but without the blank pages). It looks good and is easy to use with the due date aspect of DWM.  What I like most is being able to create a task that is linked to an email in Gmail, and then that task is grouped with the others.<br><br>As for paper, I used a nice Moleskine for AF1-4, but for DWM I just bought a composition book with 100 ruled sheets. I then dated them manually starting with Feb. 16, and use paper clips to mark the two entry pages.  I did this because of Mark's recommendation of paper, but I may eventually settle with electronic.</div>

<div class="content">For now (!), I'm using OmniFocus. One tip is that the iPhone interface adds one feature that I like that's missing from the main app. Like Google Tasks, mentioned above, the OF on the iPhone, will show the task list divided into Day sections. The desktop app, lumps them all together, although there's a date column that you can scrutinize.<br><br>The visual seperation of days on the iPhone makes for a nice, easy DWM list.<br><br>(Related, OmniFocus can sync with iCal, which you can then view by day, thus seeing just that day's tasks...)</div>

<div class="content">Just tried out www.gqueues.com. It's free and integrates with Google well. You can create a smart list of tasks that are 4 weeks out or less, but apparently not exactly 1 month. You also do not have a default option of making tasks due a month from now, BUT it is very easy to do this just as it is in Google tasks by writing Check out GQueues 3/13. There is an iPhone app of course. ;-) It allows you to make any email or website into a task as well. It might be a little buggy, but for you fiddlers it could be fun. ;-)</div>

I understand why, but this somehow seems wrong to me. Let's suppose I have a task like "Pick up present for party on Friday". That is a task with a *real* due date.

<div class="content">So, I am using FocusPad for my todo list. It does not currently support DWM, but I have been pondering if I could use it anyway. Here is my idea:<br><br>* Turn on the option to show the creation date.<br><br>* New tasks and re-entered tasks automatically get added to the end of the list. I would color the re-entered tasks blue. New tasks would remain black.<br><br>* Each day I would go into the list and delete (or gray out) any black todos that have been created 30 days before today. Similarly I would delete or gray out any blue todos that have been created 7 days or more before today.<br><br>* To find a task to do, I scan the list from beginning to end.<br><br>This seems like it would work, but I have not used DWM yet, so I might be missing something.

<div class="content">@Mel & @Mike,<br>In Toodledo "Due by" is the typical Due Date. The task must be completed *by* this date. "Due on" simply means that the tasks is like an appointment. It is due *on* that date. The "Optionally On" means that the task will be removed from the list if not done by the date and if it is recurring it will be moved forward.
