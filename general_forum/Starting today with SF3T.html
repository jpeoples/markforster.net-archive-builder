<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-23 13:53</div>
<div class="content">After perusing the series “Reviews of the Systems” I decided to set up one which is mainly SF plus the 3T concept: only three tasks at a time will be reentered in C2. Other unfinished tasks will go to the end of C1, as in AF. The reason for that is that I believe that finishing certain projects will give an important boost to my life, while others are most desirable but will not have the same impact.<br><br>I must confess I was amused while reading the presentation of SF by Mark as the perfect system, most so as he himself points to the relative advantages and weaknesses of his various systems.<br><br>There is no perfect system in itself, it is only in conjunction with the user’s personality, needs and goals that a good system can be devised.<br><br>Take fitness programs for example: the adequacy of any program will depend on your needs and goals. If you are planning to run a marathon, your training program will completely differ from that of a fellow training to break a weight lifting record - and will have definitely very different results. <br><br>Or operation systems: which OS is better will depend on your hardware and needs. While I love the Ubuntu family and its derivatives, Linux Mint with the Gnome desktop was a little too heavy for my old 2GHz cpu 512 RAM while Xubuntu with the lighter Xfce desktop and software selection is perfect. However my neighbor with a 1Gh cpu 256 RAM wasn’t able to run Xubuntu: for him, nothing can beat Puppy Linux.<br><br>I find the diversity of systems Mark created is the most valuable thing in his approach. Understanding them (I’m sure I don’t completely understand them after a couple of readings of the “Reviews”, but I think I’ve got the main ideas) allows you to create the optimal system for you at the present time.<br><br>I love Mark’s work.<br><br>Well, so I am all set up and starting today with SF3T. Wish me luck!</div>

<div class="content">Marcelo,<br><br>I am a big proponent of 3T.  What I found was that the magic was in the 3T and the feeder system did not matter, as the 3T component got me focused on completing high value tasks very quickly.  What I ultimately discovered was I just needed a capture place for everything and the 3T method got the work done.  Additionally, I found it to be very simple.  If you are interested, I wrote about it here.  I am interested in hearing how you like what ever version you try.<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com/2010/11/triple-time-management-my.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com/2010/11/triple-time-management-my.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry,<br>I love the simplicity of your system! Still I think it is too sharp focused for what I need at present and SF3T my deliver a more balanced day, touching a little of other issues as well while still keeping focus on the main -present- 3 tasks. Or is it just that I already started with this one and want to get going? I guess it is so, too. So I get going with SF3T but I really like the transparency of your system. Thanks for the link!</div>

<div class="content">Is 3-T a variant on Leo Baubauta's 3 MIT (Most important tasks)?  In any case, it sounds interesting indeed -- where can I read more about it?</div>

<div class="content">It's not related to Leo's system.  It is related to Gerry's system above.  Here's the definitive article about it.<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/27/review-of-the-systems-three-task-method-3t.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/27/review-of-the-systems-three-task-method-3t.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>Mark briefly developed and tested the idea right before Superfocus.  As Superfocus was developing, I connected well with the idea and implemented it by adding a capture section to the system just so I could know I had everything in my system and then I used the 3T method to get tasks done.  The link to my blog is how I used the system, but the initial idea came from Mark.   Good luck, I think it works great.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Gerry,<br>Just to clarify -- you cycle around the 3 tasks until 2 of them are done -- and then you add 2 more tasks -- and keep cycling.  Is that right? <br><br>Steve</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-24 18:40</div>
<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>Yes, I add tasks when I have 2 done, this allows some choice and sometimes you just can't do the last task for some reason.  The key to 3T is to write actionable tasks that can be done in less than a day.  So put read 30 pages of War and Peace not War and Peace.  Put call architect to obtain bid for services not build dream house.  Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry,<br>A brief update. I've been using the 3T system for about five days now and finding it's a huge help and that it sets a good working  rhythm for me. I'm going to stay with it for awhile and see where it leads.  Thank you.<br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">Reading this thread, I'm realizing that I've naturally fallen into a 3T/SF system<br><br>Once I learned how to use C2 correctly (that is, don't put too many active projects there at once, just the one(s) you are going to address on the current page), I decided to keep a "top project" list alongside. My "top project" list reminds me which projects I am trying to work on in C2, and at appropriate times of day, I pick one or more of them to write in. (I define each of these as "make more progress on Project X")<br><br>I tend to have two or three of these top projects, and just yesterday I decided to formally limit the list to three.<br><br>Voila, SF gave birth to 3T all by itself.</div>

<div class="content">3T is a great way to super-charge any system. I even use a variation when grocery shopping. Pick three items that are in the same area, memorize, get.</div>

<div class="content">It's impossible to do everything at the same time. The main point about doing thing is choosing the right thing to do at the right time. <br><br>Using SF or GTD or whatever doesn't change anything for me. <br><br>Since a long time I always decided to work on one thing at a time. So I pick from my system the right thing to do. I could take 3 of them and gona try.</div>

<div class="content">What I like about 3t is it separates the act of prioritising from action. So once you have the three tasks you are solidly in action mode without the list scanning to get in the way. Additionally it does get you to focus on priorities which is not a strong point in gtd. I find it simple and productive. I have a new twist on it I am writing an article about whcih should be done over the weekend</div>

<div class="content">absolutly right with Gerry. <br><br>I use GTD as a big warehouse were I put all my stuff. It's on Omnifocus. <br>As contexts are a real mess with me I only kept the waiting for context and the frozen context. <br>When I need to work I first read all project at a glance and pick 3 tasks <br>I can also If I am in that mood ake the no context actions and do the same<br><br>I have also my note book and use it as a stuff collector un front. <br>And in back I use a paper mate pencil to put my 3 tasks and focus on it<br>When they are finished they are erased and so the page is clean. <br><br>The system works great. <br>1. Because all my stuff is collected in one place ie omnifocus (OF)  by project<br>2. Because the collector (my paper note book) is easy and let me concentrate on what happen during the day. It makes things easy to summarize on OF is necessary. <br>3. Because there is no priority so I don't have to think, place things here or there, <br>4. It s much easy that AF4 and SF, and the principle is kept (the double reading and stand out principle)<br>5. OF is great for planning my stuff and task, it goes very fast <br>6. OF is great for dead lines i can see at a glance what i am waiting for. <br>7. OF Group Tasks+projects+notes so I have a real view of all very easely and of my projects actives or not and can go in details if necessary. <br>8. The 3 tasks system let me focus on what I must do now and if i need details i go to my collector or on omnifocus.<br>9. No problem about dissmissing if something become non operational it's erased that's all.</div>

It will be interesting to read your article when it's finished. I've been using my own system using 3 selected tasks at a time (in addition to 3 selected outcomes for a week) since 28th Feb and it's working great for me.</div>

<div class="content">Actually: <br><br>I say it's 'my own system' but it's really a synthesis of 3T, DIT, GTD, GSD (Get S*it done), USGTM (everything written in one place) with some basic Agile and Continuous Improvement methods thrown in!</div>
