<div class="content">In another thread, Seraphim wrote:<br><br>> I could never work with a limit of 50 items; I typically have 300-500 on my DWM<br>> list at any given time. (which is less than I had with AFx: almost never less than 1000).<br><br>Having retrieved my jaw from the floor, here's my own situation by contrast. <br><br>My current initative is to get working my DWM list faster - much faster. Mark said somewhere that one ought to get round the list daily. Someone else said that 60 items was their personal maximum for the list, and that sounds reasonable to me.<br><br>My list has typically been around the 115-item mark, and I've been taking a week to get round it. I just don't spend that much time on it daily. After work (self-employed) and resisting work, and after domestic life such as cooking, walking dogs, actually being in the company of my wife ... a long list is a deterrent. I tend to unbutton, flake out, binge on blogs or telly and let the list go hang. I want a shorter list.<br><br>So I'm going through it cutting out repetitions, items that have got done but not been removed, packing away project-related items into notes attached to a general "Work on X" task, and dismissing stuff without waiting for it to go over the waterfall. <br><br>I'm also altering the one-month period for first entry to three weeks.<br><br>All this for the sake of keeping the length of the list down and making it less depressing to contemplate.<br><br>Am I scrabbling down the wrong badger hole here?<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Chris, I use AF rather than DWM but I too find that the longer the list the less likely I am to look at it. I have recently had a revamp and now just list projects - I have a separate sheet for each project which contains the tasks.  It means I get a better 'birds eye view' of what my working life is all about and what stands out.  I still miss stuff - I am still getting into the habit of writing everything down in one place rather than trying to remember stuff.<br><br>I think you are on the right track - if more is getting done, you know you have made a change for the good.</div>

<div class="content">Hmmm... both Chris and Alison's posts illustrate the point that no time management system is going to work unless you use it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I rather thought you might say that.<br><br>Which doesn't mean I don't accept it.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Chris, it sounds like you don't have a system for your work stuff, and also sounds like you could really use one.</div>

<div class="content">To be a bit more constructive, one of the ideas we had on this blog in the early days of AF for this sort of situation was to add the "distractions" to the AF list:<br><br>Cook<br>Walk dog<br>Acknowledge wife's existence<br>Flake out<br>Look at blogs<br>Watch tv<br>Let list go hang (for a specified time period of course)<br><br>If nothing else, doing this ensures that you get round the list a lot faster!</div>

<div class="content">Mark, as a wife (19yrs this week :) ) I'm not sure whether to be amused or offended that "acknowledge wife's existence" is on the distraction list!  LOL LOL</div>

<div class="content">Lilian:<br><br>I'm sure that if you've been married to the same guy for 19 years that he would never put such a thing on *his* list!</div>

<div class="content">Ha Ha - nice one Lillian!  I've been married for over 25 years so I know how you feel!<br><br>Also, point well taken Mark. As you say, we just have to use the system!  The reason I list projects is because otherwise I would end up with too many tasks and also it is an aid for me to see what tasks belong to what project (I have several customers each with several similar projects).<br><br>I've spent all my life keeping things in my head, so it is a mammoth task to change that habit - but I am getting there slowly but surely! I had a really good memory so never really had to worry too much in the past - I'm convinced those with poor memories are blessed as it forces them to set up habits and systems earlier in life!</div>

<div class="content">Chris: Funnily enough, my DWM list has stabilised at about the same size - 100 or so. Because I use software with a filter, I usually go right round the list once or twice a day.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence, <br><br>> Because I use software with a filter, I usually go right round the list once or twice a day.<br><br>Can you clarify - how does that follow? Because the filter reveals repeated tasks, or what?<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>Although my list has about a hundred items, I am able to filter it by the three locations I use, Home, Studio or Office. When, e.g. I am at the Studio, I set that filter on and the visible list reduces to say 60. I have a single bookmark item that I drag round and round the list, which shows in all filters.<br><br>When I go home, I change the filter from Studio to Home, and carry on from where the bookmark happens to be.<br><br>Today's date I highlight red, the date a week from now is green (under which items that have been worked on are dragged), and the dates in between highlighted amber (traffic light coding). Every morning I delete the amber items, adjust the highlighting of dates and add a new date a month ahead for new items.</div>

<div class="content">Errata:<br><br>"Every morning I delete the amber items"<br><br>Of course I should have said delete the date highlighted red and the items underneath it.</div>
