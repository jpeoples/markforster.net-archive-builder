<div class="content">Hi,<br>I'm about to start a brand new job on my return to work from maternity leave. As a result, I am truly starting from scratch with no work to carry over from my pre-maternity leave role.<br><br>So, my question is what is the best way to start the new job so I don't get behind? Are there any factors that could affect the choice of system?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Donna</div>

<div class="content">Donna,<br><br>I think the choice of system is based upon a persons analysis of their personality and work style.  All of the systems I have designed have been to combat specific issues I have had and problems I have needed to solve to be more efficient.  If you know for instance you are always on the go and don't like using a PDA, a paper based system is the choice.  If you are striving for simplicity, you may pick AF over say GTD.  <br><br>Of course there is also the issue of the fact a TM system can not help over commitment.  Did you employ a system before when you worked and did it let you down would also be worth thinking about.  Good luck<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Donna, this is an excellent opportunity to start as you mean to go on, and I'm sure you will get plenty of advice here.<br><br>I love Marks book 'Do It Tomorrow'.  I have a problem with using this system in it's purest form because many of my current customers are very used to saying 'jump' and me immediately saying 'how high'.  If you are working for an organisation you can start by setting expectations on when you get back to them on issues, emails and so on. I would highly recommend his book on the DIT system.<br><br>Having said that, you could click on the autofocus system link at the top of the page and read up on this system - in my view the simplest option.<br><br>I never got on with the DWM system - too much spread over too many pages for my liking.  Mark has hinted that he has a new system he is testing with the best bits from all his previous systems, and I am eagerly awaiting further details on that.  In the mean time I am using AF. One tweak that works for me as I have alot of projects is that I have a sheet for each project with a list of tasks for that project - and it is the project name that goes on AF and not the idividual tasks.  This helps me get a better overview of my work, as well as having the detail when I  need it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Donna, <br><br>Whatever system you decide to use, I would suggest trying to keep your incoming work as upto date as possible & try to keep clear of building up a backlog of work. This feels better / less stressful (to me, anyway) to turn up for work every day.<br><br>My personal view is that any system where long lists can feature (GTD, Autofocus) tend to make it easier to defer tasks whilst allowing many other tasks to creep in. And this can feel overwhelming. <br><br>To that end, At the moment (I change my mind a lot) I tend to favour some of the concepts from Do It Tommorow, particularly with regard to a short daily 'will do' checklist for dealing with incoming work. I use time boxing for other tasks.   <br><br>Good Luck!</div>

<div class="content">One thing I forgot to mention, is that i'm a middle manager, and most of my work will come from other people, either above or below, so I'll have lots of stuff coming to me needing attention immediately.  I will have also a chunk of work which is done regularly on a weekly/monthly basis.</div>

<div class="content">If it must be done immediately, do it immediately.  Otherwise just record it immediately.  In AF4 for example it just goes on your list at the end.  You can think later about what exactly is expected of you, when you get to it.  Stuff done regularly, simply put it on your list with a date saying when it must be finished.  When one month's work is done, either write in the next month's work item right away, or else wait until something else (calender entry; tickler file) triggers you to write it in.<br><br>I'm sure your job can keep you busy, but I see no reason you can't be very successful following a system like this.</div>

<div class="content">There may still be some value to writing down the things you do immediately so you can see how much you are accomplishing and where tasks are coming from,  DIT may be a good system where you plan the day, but then put task into the future if given to you or write then below the line if you do them same day.  But, I agree with the sentiment to try something simple from the beginning.

<div class="content">Hey Donna<br><br>A recent poll on this forum showed that of Mark's systems, his latest one DWM is used by more people than any of the others (by a long way). I find it pretty good. In particular it tames the tendency of to-do lists to grow ever bigger.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>
