<div class="content">Hi all<br><br>I've put together what I think is a fairly comprehensive collection of simplified rules for each time management system all in one place. I've included key points from Mark and links to all the original posts with the full details. <br><br>Given all the broken links and fragmented nature of this blog hopefully this might make it a bit easier to find or refresh oneself on a given system!<br><br>Have I missed any?<br><br>Re:Zero (June 2022)<br><a href="../blog/Resistance How to Make the Most of It - The Resistance Zero System.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2022/6/14/resistance-how-to-make-the-most-of-it-the-resistance-zero-sy.html</a><br>-Long list<br>-Dot items with zero resistance last to first READ EVERYTHING<br>-Do dotted items last to first<br><br>Key comment from Mark:<br>You must do a complete scan at Step 2 so that every task is considered. This is very important, because it is the scanning process that reduces the resistance you feel for each task. If you skip or foreshorten the scan, resistance will rise instead of fall.<br><br>Simple Scanning (Dec 2012)<br><a href="../blog/Simple Scanning - The Rules.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/12/2/simple-scanning-the-rules.html</a><br><a href="../blog/Top 10 Reasons Simple Scanning is the Best of All Possible Systems.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2018/10/12/top-10-reasons-simple-scanning-is-the-best-of-all-possible-s.html</a><br><br>- Long list<br>- Scan and do items as they stand out<br>- Do not add any marks for category or priority<br><br>Note from Mark: I succeeded in breaking it a while ago.<br><br>Looking at my notes, my main problems with it were that it just kept getting longer and longer and more and more oppressive. And because of the length of the list, it became very difficult to keep tasks in the right order. So there were problems of timing as well.<br><a href="../general_forum/Mark, have you broken Simple Scanning yet.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2787836</a><br><br>FV (March 2012)<br>https://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109511856508.html<br><br>-Long list<br>-Dot first un-actioned item<br>-Scan list asking 'What do I want to do before (last dotted item)?' Dot when found.<br>-When you can't find any more, do the last dotted item.

Dot when found.<br>-When you can't find any more, do the last dotted item. When done, repeat the selection process from the one you just did to the end. <br><br>Note from Mark: <br>Note that there should be a definite step up in the amount you are resisting each task for every link in the chain. Don't string together tasks for which you feel much the same amount of resistance.<br><br>If you're up for it, try this alternative version of Final Version. It's not intended to supplant the standard FV described in Issue 1, but is an interesting alternative for those who are exceptionally self-motivated individuals, or for all of us when we have some particularly heavy tasks to get through. Be warned - it is not for the faint-hearted!<br><br><br>FVP (May 2015)<br><a href="../blog/The Final Version Perfected (FVP) Instructions - Reposted.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/11/16/the-final-version-perfected-fvp-instructions-reposted.html</a><br><br>-Long list<br>-Dot first un-actioned item<br>-Scan list asking 'What do I want to do more than (last dotted item)?' Dot when found.<br>-When you can't find any more, do the last dotted item. When done, repeat the selection process from the one you just did to the end. <br><br>NQ-FVP (April 2022)<br><a href="../blog/Some Aspects of NQ-FVP (Part 2).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2022/4/23/some-aspects-of-nq-fvp-part-2.html</a><br>-Long list<br>-Dot first un-actioned item<br>-Scan list dotting each item that Stands Out<br>-When you can't find any more, do the last dotted item. When done, repeat the selection process from the one you just did to the end. <br><br>Key comment from Mark: The quickest way to kill it is to have a huge ponderous list of unweeded tasks, covered in a multitude of dots caused by long exhaustive (and exhausting) scans. Keep the list well-weeded, scan quickly and aim at a maximum of 3-5 dots in the whole list.<br><br>DIT (July 2006)<br>Book and <a href="../blog/Review of the Systems Do It Tomorrow.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2011/1/24/review-of-the-systems-do-it-tomorrow.html</a><br>-Daily list of items to do tomorrow<br>-Line drawn at end, urgent items added below the line to be done today<br>-Current initiative (big project, do first each day. i.e, work on backlog<br><br>Key comment from Mark:<br>The two main disadvantages are that people are often reluctant to carry out a proper diagnosis when they fall behind. This considerably reduces the effectiveness of the system if it is constantly running behind. There is also a considerable effort needed to push through to completing a day’s work, which can lead to resistance building against the system.<br><br>AF1 (Jan 2009)<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/</a><br><br>- Long list in book page by page<br>- Skim the first page without acting on any items.<br>- Review items in order until one grabs your attention. Focus on that item for as long as you wish. Cross it off and re-enter it at the list’s end if unfinished.<br>- Repeat the process until no item stands out on that page. Move to the next page and repeat.<br>- Dismiss all items on a page if none stand out on the first pass, except the final page, marking dismissed items with a highlighter.<br>- After finishing the final page, return to the first active page.<br><br>More on  dismissal: <a href="../blog/Autofocus a closer look at dismissal.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/13/autofocus-a-closer-look-at-dismissal.html</a><br><br>Alternative dismissal rules: <a href="../blog/Autofocus 1 New Dismissal Rule Trial.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/6/23/autofocus-1-new-dismissal-rule-trial.html</a><br><br>Key comment from Mark: Of course more than one task may get dismissed on the page, but the choice always comes down to: “Do it NOW, or admit that you are not going to do it at all”. Normally of course this stark choice only comes after you have had plenty of opportunity to do the task.<br><br><br>AF2 (June 2009)<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/27/autofocus-2-time-management-system-af2.html?SSScrollPosition=114" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/27/autofocus-2-time-management-system-af2.html?SSScrollPosition=114</a><br>One list, pages not relevant. <br>- Start with the last item on your list.<br>- Work backward until a task stands out.<br>- Complete the task fully or partially.<br>- Re-enter the task if needed.<br>- Return to the end of the list and repeat.<br><br>Dismissal:<br>- Start each day by marking the oldest block of unactioned tasks on the oldest active page by drawing a line after them.<br>- These tasks are “on notice” for dismissal.<br>- The next day, dismiss any tasks before the line that remain unactioned, preferably by highlighting them for easy review.<br><br><br>Key comments from Mark: Even more than with AF, the threat of dismissal affects the way you work the whole list. Without it there would be very little incentive to go back to the earlier pages. So please remember that if you don’t stick to the dismissal rules, you are likely to throw the whole system out of balance.<br>Reading through the list<br>At the beginning of the day, after re-drawing the line and dismissing any items, you are recommended to read the list through before starting work. It is best to read it from the beginning to the end, paying particular attention to tasks which are in danger of being dismissed in the next few days.<br>--<br>AF2 was one of the less successful methods, and I don’t think many people use it now. However if I was put into a situation where I had to juggle a lot of urgent tasks, I would certainly consider it as a method of keeping them under control.<br><br><br>AF3 (July 2009)<br><a href="../blog/The Revised Autofocus System (Autofocus 3).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/7/28/the-revised-autofocus-system-autofocus-3.html</a><br><br>- One long list<br>- Three modes: Reverse, Forward, Review<br>- Start the day in Reverse mode, read tasks until one stands out. Work on it, cross out, add at end if not done- <br>- Restart at end of list after completing a task<br>- Include 'change to forward mode' as a task in the list<br>- Forward mode is done page by page. Read all tasks on first page. Then again until you find one to do. Move onto next page when no more tasks on 'current page'. Switch to Reverse Mode when come to a page and no tasks feel ready to do. <br>- At the start of each day, draw a line below first block of unactioned tasks. If they remain unactioned by the next day, highlight them for review. Add 'switch to review mode' to the list. <br>- In review mode decide to cross out and re-add or just cross out. <br><br><br>Key comment from Mark: This system was not an improvement over either AF1 or AF2, and has been quietly forgotten.<br><br>AF4 (Sept 2009)<br><a href="../blog/Preliminary Instructions for Autofocus v. 4.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/9/5/preliminary-instructions-for-autofocus-v-4.html</a><br><br>- One long list. <br>- Add horizontal below last item. Items above the list are the Backlog. Items below are the Active list. <br>- Start at the beginning of the backlog. Work on items as they feel ready. Re-add at the end of the active list if they need more work.<br>- When no more stand out you have one pass over the active list then back to the backlog. <br>- When all items in the backlog are crossed off draw a line after the active list and the active list becomes the new backlog. <br>- Dismiss items in backlog with a highlighter if they aren't getting done. Then re-enter them, delete or add to a reminder system to re-visit at a particular time. <br><br>Key comments from Mark: AF4 is probably the most generally effective of the four Autofocus systems. In spite of its drawbacks many people have reported that it has continued to be effective after a long period of use.<br><br><br>AF4 Revised (Dec 2010)<br><a href="../general_forum/Promised AF4 Revision.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1325521</a><br><br>- Three separate pages: New, Unfinished and Recurring<br>- 'New' page is like AF4 - use a line to designate 'Old Tasks'. When finished working on them, cross off or re-enter in Unfinished or Recurring<br>- If you can't do any items on Old Tasks they are all 'Dismissed' (highlighted)<br> Key comments from Mark: The system is not good at dealing with urgent tasks, as these may be located anywhere in the four groups. Although identifying unfinished tasks is useful, there is not enough pressure to finish them.<br><br>Predictive to-do list (August 2008)<br><a href="../blog/Predicting your day.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/8/3/predicting-your-day.html</a><br><br>-Writing down a list of all the tasks which you actually think you will do today. Instead of ticking items off the list as you do them, the idea is to do one’s work without looking at the list more than a couple of times during the day.<br><br>Summary from Mark: It can be very effective, provided that the list continues to be of the things you actually think you will do today. If that is lost sight of, then the method will fail.<br><br>DMW (Feb 2010)<br><a href="../blog/DIT2 AF5 Who cares what it's called This is what I'm working on at the moment....html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html</a><br><br>- One page per day diary<br>- New tasks entered 1 calendar month from now<br>- Re-entered tasks entered 1 week from now<br>- Tasks before today are dismissed forever<br>- Any active page is treated like normal lists - circulate doing ones that stand out.<br><br>Key comments from Mark: The use of a page-a-day diary is rather clumsy. It is difficult to keep the two entry points clearly marked. The automatic timed dismissal is rather a blunt instrument, and doesn’t provide a good fit for many tasks.<br><br>DMW 2 (Oct 2010)<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10307721" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10307721</a><br><br>- Have one continuous list of tasks as in Autofocus<br>- When you enter a new task, put a mark next to it to show it is a new task (I use a black dot).<br>- When you re-enter a task, leave out the black dot.<br>- At the beginning of a new day, leave a blank line and enter the day's date on the next line.<br>- Then cross out any days earlier than one month previous, and dismiss any tasks which do not have black dots against them on pages earlier than one week previous.<br>- The difference is that instead of your current list stretching forward from today's date, it stretches backwards from it - but the effect is exactly the same.<br><br>Comment from Mark: This is a rather faster and more convenient version of DWM.<br><br>3T (Nov 2010)<br><a href="http://www.markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/11/4/live-demo-tomorrow-november-5.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/11/4/live-demo-tomorrow-november-5.html</a><br><br>- Pick three tasks and work on them in rotation until two of the tasks are completed. Then another two tasks are picked and once again one works on the three tasks until two are completed.<br><br>Comment from Mark: 3-T is not really a complete system, but can be very effective in clearing projects which have got stuck. It drew attention to the desirability of working tasks to completion, and later systems have found better ways of doing this.<br><br>AF4-3T (Nov 2010)<br><br><a href="../blog/The rules by which I ran the demo.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/11/7/the-rules-by-which-i-ran-the-demo.html</a><br><br>-  AF4 style list with line used to split closed list from open. <br>- Rather than choosing one task, three are selected from the closed list (above the line). When 2 are done, add 2 more. <br>- When no more remain in closed list you can include the open list. <br>- Dismissal rules as per AF4. <br><br>SuperFocus (2nd Revision) (Nov 2010)<br><br><a href="../general_forum/Rules for SuperFocus - 2nd Revision.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1317396</a><br><br>- AF1 Rules with the addition of a second column. <br>- Unfinished and urgent tasks can be added to the second column of the current page. <br>- Second column treated the same way as the rest of the page, including rules for dismissal. <br>- Column 2 cannot be opened on the last page. <br><br>SuperFocus (3rd Version) (Feb 2012)<br><br><a href="../blog/SuperFocus Instructions (Third Revision).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2011/2/7/superfocus-instructions-third-revision.html</a><br><br>- Unfinished tasks are entered on column 2 of following page (this is the first active page if you're on the last page)<br>- Urgent tasks are entered on column 2 of the current page. <br>- All tasks in column 2 must be completed before moving to the next page. <br>- When you visit a page that is full (column 2 is full) all tasks must be done or dismissed. <br><br>Comment from Mark: The aim of these rule changes is to increase the flow of the system by no longer re-entering unfinished tasks on the same page. At the same time additional pressure is brought to bear to keep working on unfinished tasks. Once a task has been entered in Column 2 it must remain in Column 2 on every page until it is finished.<br><br>ASEM (May 2013)<br><br><a href="../blog/Another Simple and Effective Method.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html</a><br><br>- Long list<br>- Each time a task is selected it created a split of two groups - you then need to do a task from each of the sides of the split. This results in 4 groups so one from each of the 4 is done on the next pass and so on. <br><br>A revision to avoid lots of single items being required to be done is detailed here: <a href="../blog/Reviewing an Old Favourite.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2018/11/18/reviewing-an-old-favourite.html</a><br><br>ASAPM (June 2013)<br><br><a href="../blog/A Simple and Powerful Method.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/6/9/a-simple-and-powerful-method.html</a><br><br>- As ASEM but select items you are most resisting to do first. <br><br>TUTMS (June 2013)<br><a href="../blog/The Ultimate Time Management System.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/6/13/the-ultimate-time-management-system.html</a><br><br>- Two lists, an Old List and a New List<br>- Start with the Old List, work on tasks in any order. <br>- Once nothing stands out move to New List. <br>- In the new list you can only select items from the list that come after the task you just did. <br>- Once you have done one pass of the new list you move back to the Old List<br>- Delete all items in old list if none stand out. <br>- When Old List in empty, New List becomes Old List and a new New List is created. <br><br>Important note: If a task comes up which needs to be done immediately, write it down at the end of the New List, stop what you are doing and go straight to it. This is quite in accordance with Rules 4 and 8.<br><br>TUTMS Improved (July 2013)<br><a href="../blog/The Ultimate Time Management System Improved.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/7/2/the-ultimate-time-management-system-improved.html</a><br><br>- AF4 style scanning and making a pass. <br>- Move to New List when to tasks stand out from the Old List<br>- Unfinished tasks in Old List are left in place and marked with a dot<br>- When making a pass over Old List any dotted items must be worked on before you can move back to New List<br><br>Note from Mark: I stress that I have not tested these modifications out fully, so I’m sharing them for the benefit of other people who would like to experiment with them.<br><br>----<br><br>General links:<br>Review of the systems:<br><a href="../blog/Review of the Systems.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/12/16/review-of-the-systems.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Big effort! I do think you've conflated the instructions for FV and FVP. FV has you executing your dotted chain all the way to the first dot, while FVP does the scan after every dot.</div>

<div class="content">This is great!<br><br>You missed my favorite system, random:<br><br>Long list in book page by page<br>- Use a randomizer where the max imum number equals the number of lines on a page<br>-Allow the randomizer to select a task. Focus on that item for as long as you wish. Cross it off and re-enter it at the list’s end if unfinished.<br>-If the randomizer lands on a crossed off task, slide down until the first uncrossed off task on that page. <br>-- If you get to the bottom of the page and it is all crossed off, start again at the top.<br>-If the random number is greater than the number of lines left on the page, keep counting on the next page.<br><br>I love this method and have been using it successfully for 6 months with two variations:<br><br>1) I have a five minute rule. If I land on a task that is actionable, but I feel resistance, I commit to work on it for five minutes before crossing it off and rewriting it.<br><br>2) I will sometimes blend this with 3T/feeder. I add 3 tasks that appear on every page (I do this all digitally in Excel). This ups the priority of those tasks but still allow for other tasks to come up and give me a productive break from the 3T tasks.</div>
