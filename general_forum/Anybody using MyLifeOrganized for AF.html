<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Just wondering if anybody has been trying to use MyLifeOrganized with AF? <br>www.mylifeorganized.net<br><br>Some mentioned trying to use ListPro, but I havent seen any posts on how that goes?<br><br>I noticed that some people are using Backpack and it seems very neat, but I really would like to have an electronic system that I can use offline as well, and take with me on my handheld, and Backpack requires me to sit in front of the computer, and online. <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content"><br>I've been using MLO since Oct. 2007 for DIT. On day 1 of the AF betatest I tried to start on paper but as my handwriting is rather spidery (Ger: krakelig) I soon fell back to a computer implementation. First I tried Excel because I thought here I can see the number of lines I use on each tab (= page). But in Excel I missed the automatism I had with MLO and DIT like my tickler list or regularly recurring task (e.g. my Monday, Tuesday etc. or weekly and monthly lists) which automatically "pop up" in my MLO file when their time is due. I then had a "flash of insight" how I could simulate the 30 lines per page mechanism in MLO. <br><br>- Autofocus <br>-- page 10   23.01. ===========<br>---- task 1<br>---- task 2<br>...<br>---- task 30<br><br>-- page 11   24.01. ===========<br>---- task 1<br>---- task 2<br>...<br>---- task 30<br><br><br>- tickler<br>---- future task x    on 20.2.2009  (MLO will automatically show me these items on that date)  <br>---- future task y    on 12.3.2009    <br><br><br>- recurring tasks<br>-- weekly<br>--- ® copy Monday tasks to AF     on 16.2.2009 + recurring every week  (tasks are listed in the notes field)<br>--- ® copy Monday tasks to AF     on 17.2.2009 + recurring every week<br>... and so on ...<br>-- monthly<br>--- ® monthly backup              on 1.3.2009 + recurring every month<br>--- ® Review dismissed items      on 10.3.2009 + recurring every month<br><br><br>- Projects<br>...<br><br><br>- Dismissed     (here I copy those tasks which I dismissed from Autofocus above => easy reviewing in one place)<br>...<br><br><br>There is unfortunately still a manual process in my MLO implementation of AF because I don't know how to automatically get the current number of subelements (childs) for the "page" elements above. So my workaround is to use 2 additional helper elements named "____ (10) ____" and "____ (20) ____" where I manually count the lines on a page after I added a certain amount of tasks and put these helper lines after 10 and 20 tasks so that I then can easily spot when I've reached 30 lines and must create a new page. In case I have added more than 30 lines on a page the new MLO version can now move all the surplus tasks to the new page after it is created (CTRL+M).<br><br>The beauty with MLO is that with SHIFT+CTRL+M you can always add new tasks to the end of the current last page independent of which other application has the focus at the moment as long as MLO is running in the background.<br><br>I am totally happy with my 2 MLO files (work + home) as I have all important things in one place.<br>Every day I first start with an MLO view where I check whether new tasks got activated from tickler or recurring tasks and copy (recurring) or move (tickler) them to the last page in AF. Then I continue with my AF view where I can see all active pages and can easily collapse (cursor left) or show (cursor right) the tasks of 1 page. <br><br>Hope that helps,<br>Klaus<br></div>

<div class="content">The second "® copy Monday tasks to AF on ..." above should read "® copy Tuesday tasks to AF on ...".<br><br>In the notes field of such a task I have listed all the task I want to do on that day (or shortly afterwards).  For example <br>® Inbox Zero <br>® archive papers <br><br>I then only have to do the following sequence:<br>CTRL-A       (=  "select all" tasks in the notes field)<br>CTRL-C       (= copy selection to the clipboard)<br>SHIFT+CTRL-M    (= open rapid task entry window of MLO)<br>CTRL-V     (= paste clipboard contents into MLO window) <br>click "Add tasks" button    <br><br>=> now all new tasks are in my AF list at the end of the last page and I don't have to retype them or anything like that.<br><br>I use the ® as a marker for me that it is a recurring (routine) task. Thus I see at once in the AF view that the task is well known and does'nt require extra (unknown) effort to get started or finished.<br></div>

<div class="content">This is brilliant, thank you so much I will try this out! You should submit a template to the MLO team so they could incorporate it into the software. There is a DIT template already f ex. but it would be great if you wanted to give them your AF template! <br><br>By the way; how come you have chosen to keep two separate files rather than having two top levels "work" and "home" and then simply filter on work resp home? <br><br></div>

<div class="content">@Tigerigis<br>I use a normal notebook computer at work and my fine netbook at home and I like to keep both areas separated => therefore 2 separate MLO files.<br>Before I can upload my MLO file somewhere  I have to translate it into English first. At the moment it contains a mix of English and German expressions and thus woudn't be very helpful to the majority of the MLO users :-)<br>What motivates me the most with my AF implementation in MLO is when I see that I only have 3 or 4 tasks left on 1 page. I get a real kick and do everything to work on each of those tasks at least a little bit or maybe even finish them just to be able to cross of the  whole page as done - this is such a good feeling. <br>I am totally thankful that Mark gave us this fine AF system. I have tried all the major systems for years but have never done so much with such relaxed feelings and the conviction that I now have the tool to bring forward my duties + goals . <br><br>Thank you Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Hi again Klausr,<br><br>Just a quick question: are you working in the outline view or in the todo view? I can't seem to get the pages reflected properly in the todo view but it is of course easy to do in the outlook view. <br><br>(The reason I would like to work in the todo view is that then I can use the context filter to filter "work" from "home" from the same mlo file.)<br><br>How are you working with it?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Tigerigis,<br>I've set up MLO with page numbers as contexts, and allowing 28 tasks per page, before another page gets created. I work mainly from the To-do view, with the filter as showing all active tasks, and I have renamed my view as AF view. So, once I'm done with page, I move to the next by jumping to the next context page which I keep visible on the left hand side filter column.Once a page is emptied, I delete the context for it, so as not to clog up the contexts list.<br><br>This hasn't created any problems to date for me, and the flow is pretty smooth. Plus as you know, MLO has nifty short cuts like Ctrl+D, to duplicate and move a task to the last page, etc. It's been working like a charm so far.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi JD,<br><br>Great, thanks! <br><br>I had no idea you could set MLO so that a new page is created automatically when you have reached a certain number of items - where and how do you do that?</div>

<div class="content">I used MLO for the first few weeks with AutoFocus, but switched to ListPro for ease of use with my Windows Mobile PDA. Using the CardExport software, I am able to almost instantly alternate between using the PDA and Desktop versions of ListPro. While the PDA is connected, the SD card acts as USB hard drive from which the data files can be opened (the PDA and Desktop data formats are the same). Formerly I had to synchronize the PDA before moving from one platform to the other, a much longer process which sometimes would fail and slow things further..</div>

<div class="content">Hi Tigerigis<br><br>I work mostly in the To-Do view. I set up a filter for Autofocus like this:<br><br>Group by<br>1.    Top Level Parent<br>      This group expanded,              Descending<br><br>2.    Parent,                           Descending<br><br>x     Show items count in groups<br><br>This last option is very cool because I see the number of open tasks per page at the end of the line at a glance.<br><br><br>In To-Do I have my pages collapsed and visible as one line each. <br><br>+ Autofocus   (5)<br>..    +  11    24.01.2009 =============   (3)<br>..    +  12    27.01.2009 =============   (2)<br>..    +  13    01.02.2009 =============   (11)<br>..    +  14    07.02.2009 =============   (14)<br>..    +  15    21.02.2009 =============   (9)<br><br><br>I have only 1 context for the whole Autofocus subtree. I then select a page (e.g. 12 above) and press cursor right so that this page expands and all tasks of it are visible. I work on this page like AF says and when I am done I press cursor left and collapse this page again and continue in the same way with the next one. <br>I love this way of working because I am not distracted in the To-Do view by already finished and striked out lines.<br></div>

<div class="content">Tigerigis - sorry, my post was misleading. MLO doesn't automatically create a page, you need to control this manually. I stop when 28 tasks are created and start a new page. I believe, however, a request to this effect has been made by Steve Wynn over at the MLO group.<br><br>Klausr - very nice set up you got there, I am experimenting with it. The immediate advantage I can see here is that it saves you from creating a context by page each time you need to start one. Just a top level parent, and presto, it shows up on the to-do view. The drawback I suppose is that every top level parent shows up, but when collapsed, it doesn't distract you from your AF pages. Thanks for sharing your set up.<br><br>For those using MLO as an implementation tool, I think the number of ways you can set up the AF system in it shows the immense flexibility of the software.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi JD,<br><br>I created 5 different views:<br><br>1.)  "feed into Autofocus"<br>Shows all tasks which are active from "tickler" or "recurring tasks (routine)".<br>No Autofocus tasks are shown in this view. I start with this view every day and empty it. But I do not do any action I only decide for each of those new active tasks whether to move / copy it into the AF subtree now or delay the task for some time, because it is not yet urgent or import enough to have it in my AF list now. I don't want to overload my AF list with too many active tasks, because this demotivates me.   <br><br>2.) sort by Due Date - this month<br>Shows which tasks are overdue, due today or due soon from Autofocus, tickler and routine. This gives me a short overview about urgent tasks.  <br><br>3.) Goals<br>Shows which tasks are marked in MLO as weekly or monthly goals. This gives me a short overview about important tasks. I prefer to mark important goals as monthly goals because you don't see this later in the Autofocus view and they thus do not stand out.<br><br>4.) Number of tasks in Autofocus<br>I just have a very short look how many tasks are open overall in my AF list. Use "Group by" "Top Level Parent" only and set "Show items count in groups"<br><br>5.) Autofocus ##### open tasks<br>This is the view I use to do my AF in. <br><br>JD> The drawback I suppose is that every top level parent shows up, but when collapsed, it doesn't distract you from your AF pages.<br><br>You can select the contexts which should be displayed in a specific view,  so I do not get distracted, because I only show the context "Autofocus"  (contains all my Autofocus tasks) and and 1 additional context ("urgent today").<br><br>This "urgent today" context has the same effect as the post it notes described by some of the "paper using people" => I see at the top of the To-Do list those special tasks which have to be done today and can thus integrate them into the "scan" of a page to decide what task stands out. I only used this "post it" feature once or twice though, because I usually do not get such important tasks with such a short timeline. And when I do, well, then AF has to wait.<br><br>Hope that helps,<br>klausr<br></div>

<div class="content">Klausr - Thanks, that helps a lot! I've already incorporated some of your views. What used to work like a charm now works like a dream. Appreciate it greatly.</div>
