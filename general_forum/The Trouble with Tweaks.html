<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-05-11 6:20</div>
<div class="content">I have come to realise that pretty well all the tweaks mentioned here so far may affect how well intuition can work in Autofocus.<br><br>In particular, the major issue (for me as well) seems to be the desire to visit every page at least once a day, which for some of us is essential.<br><br>If we are failing to do this, in the normal run of things intuition will cause us to skim rapidly through the pages on the first pass, processing items with very low time cost, and postponing the nitty gritty till a second pass.<br><br>But if we are using an alternative method such as index card or moving backwards from the current, that process of intuition will be inhibited.<br><br>So while the tweaks I have seen are very clever and are doing the job, I am back to using the original at present. Who was it that said "It's so simple, it must be true."</div>

<div class="content">Is moving backward a tweak?<br><br>"You work through the list one page at a time  ...  Move onto the next page and repeat the process"<br>It is probably due to my limited understanding of English,  but I have the feeling that the description is unspecific concerning the choice of the 'next' page (although there is point 8).  I once tossed coins, the I Ching way by lack of dices, to add some playfulness in the choice of the 'next' page. I am not certain MF will agree, but the rules are on paper free to be misinterpreted. More important to me is to avoid a nagging feeling of forgotten tasks somewhere on another page, eating up my intuition.  Many tweaks are about solving that problem.<br></div>

<div class="content">Laurence, I have to say I agree with you, despite having created a "tweak".  That is the reason i was reluctant to post it, because "tweaking" can destroy the benfits of AF or even worse encourage deviation from the system before thiose benefits have been experienced.<br><br>My tweak is designed to deal with a specific set of circumstances - ie a lot of deadline driven "do now" items.  I do not want to use my tweak when that scenario is not in play BECAUSE it inhibits the intuitive aspect of AF.  The tweak is designed to keep me in AF when otherwise I would have had to work "outside the system" which I did not want to do.<br><br>Thanks for bringing this point up!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lawrence and All,<br><br>While I agree that one should be very careful about tweaks to AF, I am not sure I agree completely that one cannot make changes to address some key concerns.  As Damien and many others have voiced here -- there is a concern that when one is in the situation with many pages -- and there are things that must be done soon -- that these will be missed somehow because of not getting to the appropriate pages on time.  Remember, Mark himself is working on a new system -- perhaps a hybrid of AF -- that addresses these concerns.  So even he acknowledges that this can be an issue in AF.<br><br>So, yes -- be careful how much you modify/tweak AF -- this is a brilliant creation by Mark that did take him some time to work out and there are reasons why it is designed the way it is -- but if you do worry about missing critical, time-sensitive items on many pages away, then tweaks like Christine's are okay in my mind.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Well, of course the way I developed it was to keep tweaking until I got something that worked - so I can't really complain about tweaks!<br><br>I'm gradually coming to the conclusion that my "new system" would work better as part of AF rather than as something entirely separate. So trying to find the best way to combine them at the moment.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I thank God that people are unsatisfied tweakers. Without them, leaches might still be physicians' go-to treatment. On the other hand, continued tweaking can become counter-productive (genetically-modified foods being a good example). Tweaks can either lead us to an approach that works better for us as individuals or will convince us that original AF is the best choice. Aside from lost time, I don't see much risk in tweaking. I look forward to hearing about Mark's tweaks (and I'm glad he's thinking of keeping much of AF as it is brilliant).</div>

<div class="content">This does sound so very intriguing, Mark!  I am glad to hear that AF will still be the base of the new system.  Please keep us posted as things progress.  Speaking for myself....and maybe for others....we are anxiously awaiting this...I feel like a little kid waiting at Christmas for presents....smiles....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Norman, I understand that there are people who don't want to tweak AF. If it works perfectly for them, why would they? What I don't understand is why some of these same people direct so much negativity toward those who DO want to tweak it. In fact, without the latter people, I wouldn't visit this board as it would be boring as all get out. JMO.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>I think people are concerned about bending the rules of AF too much.  It one sense, it is an acknowledgement of the detailed, long-term work Mark did to arrive at what we have as AF.  I don't think there is anything wrong with protecting the integrity, if you will, of AF in this regard.<br><br>Now, with that said, I now agree that is fine...and more fun that I had realized...to see tweaks, new versions, etc.  I agree that is exciting and hope to see the creativity in all come out and shared with all of us!  <br><br>Mel, I hope you are well.  Take care,<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence,<br><br>After working this long with AF, I've found that one important realization I have had is that following AF has made me conscious of how important it is to work with rather than against my energy levels.  I had never really paid much conscious attention to my energy level before, being so used to either pushing myself or letting myself fall into long periods of inertia.  And I've also learned that I can manipulate/increase my energy level by bucking the system.  If I do that, work (and play) can be an entirely different experience.   As such, I could make the argument that I'm taking intuition one step further by letting it tell me by my level of resistance to following the rules, when it's time to *not* follow AF according to the rules.  <br><br>So I don't just have ONE tweak for AF, I probably have three or more that I choose from based on how I feel.   Some days, I have no difficulty following AF exactly according to the rules.  But sometimes I will start off following the rules, and if I find myself not wanting to continue or to do some procrastinating type of behaviour, I'll ask myself if I am willing to continue if I don't have to follow the rules and can do anything on the list that I want.  Usually that works for another couple of major tasks, where otherwise, I might have just stopped and called it quits for the night.  And then there's days that I don't want to do anything on the list, but am willing to work very hard on something else that isn't on the list but is something that will move me towards my goals.  And I can guarantee that on Saturdays, I have a strong desire to finish off at least 2-3 of my oldest active pages, and I'll go through it in order like a dreaded to-do list without any regard to intuition at all, and feel wonderful about it.   <br><br>But the beauty of the system is that I am learning how to go back and forth without disrupting anything (too badly) and making a heck of a lot of progress on what's important to me - which is the point of it all, isn't it?  <br> <br></div>

<div class="content">This is very nice and quite insightful, Jacqueline.  Thanks for bringing up the concept of energy levels into the ues of AF.  I too do very similar things as you have described and let how I feel and how tired I am help with the intuitive nature of what stands out on my lists.<br><br>Your description here was very helpful to me and I am sure to others.  Cheers!<br><br>And best wishes....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jaqueline,<br>I agree with David. Thanks for raising this point. <br><br>I've recently found I'm doing something very similar to you, which also includes Christine's tweak, which I had also found I was doing just before she posted. Very affirming.<br><br>Your post has helped me realise that by working the system this way, we are using it wisely and efficiently, rather than allowing it to use us. I think somewhere else it has been said that no system should be followed so rigidly that we lose our freedom to it.<br><br>Also the AF system works so well for so many, in part, precisely because we can do what action, in this moment, we feel like doing. This 'tweak' just takes that principle to another level. We can use the system in any way that we feel like in the present. Our enthusiasm will bring about more efficiency. <br><br>Thanks again!</div>

<div class="content">Hey David and Robina, I'm glad I'm not the only one doing this... :-)<br><br>As silly as it sounds, one of the things that really brought home to me how much fatigue can affect energy and brain levels was when playing Brain Age on my son's Nintendo DS - if I'm tired, I score higher than my real age and when well rested, my brain is 20 again.  At the time, you don't realize how much slower you really are, which is why I don't try to solve any complex problems when I'm exhausted mentally.  My time is better spent going skiing or for a long bike ride, mowing the lawn - or ripping up carpet. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Your Brain Age results, Jacqueline, give a clear, measurable example of our limitations when affected by negative emotional and physical states.<br><br>Your positive solutions (I love the bit about ripping up carpet!) to regenerate your energies and mental faculties made me think of the familiar biblical text and song: "Turn, turn, turn":<br><br>"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:"<br><br>For full version and reminder, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn!_Turn!_Turn!_(to_Everything_There_Is_a_Season)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn!_Turn!_Turn!_(to_Everything_There_Is_a_Season)</a><br><br>Perhaps we AFers could add:<br><br>A time to act, a time to dismiss and a time to cross off pages;<br>A time to be pure, a time to tweak; a time to work forwards, a time to work backwards;<br>A time to read the Forum, a time to leave the Forum to one side,<br>A time to do the list, a time to socialise and a time to go rip up carpet....<br>To everything turn, turn, turn.....<br><br>or something like that!<br><br>I hope I haven't offended anyone.<br><br>Thanks, Jacqueline, for another stimulating post!</div>

<div class="content">I certainly agree with everyone that one's mental state varies from day to day and from time to time within a day. However what I find myself is that AF takes that into account if I let it. Of course, for it to do that one needs a good mix of tasks on one's list.</div>

<div class="content">It is great coming to the forum late on and being able to learn so much from oters experiences using af - I have never really got involved with forums finding them vey cliquey but the sense of community on caring expressed here is remarkable - as is the thought and time put into the posts. <br><br>I am a teacher and have struggled sometimes with af to deal with lesson planning in that each lesson is like planning a mini project with a very short deadline. I found that I was sometimes leaving planning too late using AF so have tried linking it to a daily task sheet ( printed out on a4 then folded up into booklet which I created a word template for). I spent a couple days thinking my new system  was great: linking my daily tasks with my af book. However,  like others the real sense of enjoyment, control and progress I had felt when using  af as rxd was gone. I am going back to more pure af and will just try and think about what makes stuff standout. <br><br>Looking forward to any developments from mark - I would live to see the hits on this site since he said he was working on a new system!<br><br>I am very pleased to have found AF by chance but also this forum and mark's realistic, honest and pragmatic approach to tm</div>

<div class="content">This isn't particularly related to this thread, but is related to Mark's comment about our varying state of mind. Yesterday I completed two very large projects that have been on my list for some time. I have been feeling very resistant to working on them and in particular to working on them little and often. They finally got to the point that I could have no peace of mind until I got them done (and not just started). By the way, there wasn't a deadline for them. I have great satisfaction in finishing those projects; however, my list was completely ignored. I didn't preplan this work. I just decided to work on them in the moment. My question for Mark is, "Do you ever do this?" and if so, "How do you reconcile this with your AF approach?"</div>

<div class="content">Mel<br><br>That sounds suspiciously like "when it jumps out" and "for as long as you feel like" to me!<br><br>If the resistance was to "little and often" that would explain the all at once necessity.  I have found that some of my projects did not respond well to the "little and often" approach.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-12 18:41</div>
<div class="content">Mel:<br><br>What I find is that there comes a time when a task which has been on the list for some time suddenly feels ready to be done. When that happens, I know that the next time I come to that on my AF list I will do at least some work on it. But I try not to anticipate, because if I leap to a task without following the rules, that affects all the other tasks on the list as well.<br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-12 18:43</div>
<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>That's right. Working on something for as long as you feel like doesn't necessarily mean "little and often". Sometimes you feel like doing it all at once, as Mel found.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-13 2:57</div>
<div class="content">Mel, I got from your post that you did them out of order?  Ie. you weren't on that page on the list?<br><br>Good for you for getting those pesky jobs done!<br><br>Maybe I'm a hard case, but I followed my enthusiasm and went out of order on the list when doing my son's taxes this year, had them all finished on-line six weeks early, but didn't have the code handy to file them electronically.  Six weeks later, on the day they were due, I pushed the button to file them electronically.  In all that time, I never again felt that great enthusiasm to finish them off.  In hindsight, I wish I had followed my original impulse to go through my files to find the code right then and there, but I assumed it would come up and feel ready to be done naturally.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, I hadn't even looked at my list. I just decided in the moment to work on those two giant tasks that were keeping me from having peace (thanks, learning as I go, for helping me realize that). If I'm not going to follow the AF rules, I don't use the list. It helps me to keep the system intact and functional for me.<br><br>But something Mark said has me wondering if by doing what I did if I am missing out on the motivating force that gets so many things done or dismissed quickly. If I had thought, "I've got to get through these pages so I can get to those hot projects," I might have been really pleased. On the other hand, with over 30 pages, I would have had very little if any time left to work on those tasks I was dying to complete. I think my problem is and always has been that I have a hard time sticking to "rules" for long, even if I've created them. It's either that or I don't do well with delayed gratification. A long list requires me to wait hours to days to get to the tasks that suddenly stand out. I have honestly wondered if I ought to dismiss all my early tasks, only re-adding them if they stand out on review. My list is just too long to work in the standard way.</div>

Thirty pages seems a lot if you have followed the rules and have refrained from dumping tasks into the list.<br><br>If you haven't been following the rules and/or have dumped tasks into the list, then I suggest you start a new list with no more than five easy tasks on it initially and let it grow organically - no dumping!<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark, neither cause is in play here; I just haven't had and haven't chosen time for working my AF list. So it keeps growing. I think it's that and a general period of discouragement I'm in that has nothing to do with my list. I have time this afternoon to dedicate to the list. I'll see if getting into it helps. If not, I will consider starting over or powering through the list as Jacqueline did. If that doesn't work, I may head for a tropical island that doesn't have swine flu. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mel, in looking back at my stats, I actually went from 22 active pages to 5 in 6 days.  I recall refusing to put almost anything new on the list at all during that time (the burnt out light bulb in a room I never used could wait...) and I focused on finishing things.  <br><br>I felt a tremendous relief after doing it.   The very length of the list was making me feel overwhelmed.  And when I'm overwhelmed, I feel discouraged and procrastinate.<br><br>Only about 25% of my dismissed items made it back onto the list later, which shows how unimportant many of them were, and the others got done at a later date (entered 'organically').  Since I don't really remember doing them, they must have been finished with no resistance at all.  <br><br>I'm back up to 15 now, only because I've been spending my weekends on my consulting work, so my home tasks are piling up.  I think it's a good thing to regularly focus (with AF according to the rules + some self-discipline) on those older active pages to keep the numbers down.   It's like spring cleaning / decluttering.  Having said that, I can only do it myself if I'm really in the mood.  Fortunately, the mood strikes every Saturday morning.  :-)</div>
