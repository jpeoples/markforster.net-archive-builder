<div class="content">Hello everyone, <br>We all are used to being busy today and in the pace of life we often forget to meet friends. I think this is an issue of inefficient time management. So if you keep it right, you will always find time for old buddies. Encountering this problem myself brought be to the idea of creating Friendtainer  app. It's a smartphone app which helps you meet with your friends regularly. You can add contacts and choose frequency - decide how often you want to meet. If you fail to record a meeting within given timespan you will start receiving reminders until you record a meeting.<br>The app is created as a Progressive Web Application which means that it provides a native-like experience on mobile devices.<br>Our app runs in a browser. No need to download it from an app store. You can just sign up and start using it for FREE. <br><a href="http://friendtainer.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://friendtainer.com/</a><br><br>Would be nice to hear some feedbacks and opinions. What do you think about getting reminded of meeting friends. Would you use any tool like this? :)<br><br>Thanks!</div>
