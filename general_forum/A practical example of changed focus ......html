<div class="content">With AF working on an intuitive level as opposed to a rational level, it can often be difficult to get our thoughts around the concept of that working in practice.  I experienced a very clear example of how that worked today which I thought I would share in case it helped explain the concept to anyone else ........<br><br>Today I misplaced an item.  It was nothing important but pre AF I would have immediately spent time looking for it, beating myself up in the process about having lost it in the first place, and once I had found it would have allowed the distraction to lead me on to other means of procrastination.<br><br>Today I thought, well it's around somewhere and will turn up in due course.  I added it my list as "find x"  I was interested to note as I wrote it that I wrote "find x" and not "look for x"  "Look for x" would have created a distraction and I instictively knew that it would turn up without me having to get in a flap looking for it. The task "find x" was more of a memory aid (along the lines of "has Bob returned my call?") than a task (probably should have been "found x?").  Half an hour later I found a different item that I had not put away, and therefore was "misplaced".  As I picked it up to put away I was not only reminded that I had a misplaced item on my list but recalled instantly where I had put it.  The funny think was that I had moved it from it's normal place because I thought I needed to find a new place for it BUT I hadn't used AF to task that.<br><br>This was a really trivial item (and I wouldn't have considered any need to put it's relocation on a list) BUT it's loss would previously have become a major procrastinator for me.  What was a really interesting discovery for me was the impact of AF, not in that I almost "magically" recalled where the item was but in the fact that, putting it on the list, AF automatically released my mind from thinking about it and enabled that recall to happen.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>Yes I've picked up from you in previous posts about putting !everything! on AF list.<br>With no judgements or decisions being made, and with the wording appropriate for the action I want to take.<br><br>Like you magically stuff is getting done AND my mind is better at recall and relaxed.<br><br>It's all so great isn't it :)<br><br>Being an intuitive based system, I'm wondering if being relaxed and just letting the process work, items stand out, get done and this also allows the mind to relax even more<br></div>

<div class="content">I think that is the key Margherita, because the mind is more relaxed and less stressed it is more able to focus on things.<br><br>Funnily enough a short while after doing the above post I misplaced something that was important, namely the gizmo banks now require you to have to confirm online banking transactions.  (Why is it that Christmas causes everything to migrate to unusual places?)  My immediate response was to panic but I remembered what I had just written, wrote down "find gizmo" and suddenly realised that my Dad has one, and as I will see Dad tomorrow I can just do the transfer then. No problem - mine will turn up sometime before I next need it.<br><br>AF really is a fantastic tool.<br><br></div>
