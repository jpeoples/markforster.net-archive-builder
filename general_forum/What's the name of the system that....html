<div class="content">I'm trying to remember the name of a system. I searched the site for a bit but couldn't find it. <br>Characteristics of the system:<br><br>1. It's a long list system.<br>2. You enter new tasks at the bottom.<br>3. You scan from the top-down.<br>4. Whatever task stands out, you work on it for as long as you want.<br>5. You cross it off when you no longer want to work on it. If there is more work to be done, you re-enter it at the bottom.<br>6. You start scanning again from the top (repeat from point #3).<br><br>TIA.<br>(Sorry if the answer is obvious and the system is well known, it's just one of those things that nags your brain, but I don't have time to dive into the blog).</div>

<div class="content">I am not the expert, but it sounds like the original Autofocus (AF1). Here: <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/.</a></div>

<div class="content">Manuel:<br><br>The system you describe is "Reverse AF2":<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/10/5/the-hidden-power-of-procrastination.html#comment16637844" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/10/5/the-hidden-power-of-procrastination.html#comment16637844</a><br><br>"Reverse" because in the original AF2, after each task, you start at the end of the list and scan backwards (from the bottom up). Here is the original AF2:<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/27/autofocus-2-time-management-system-af2.html?SSScrollPosition=114" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/27/autofocus-2-time-management-system-af2.html?SSScrollPosition=114</a><br><br>You may be interested in Mark's recent endorsement of the original AF2 system (minus the dismissal rules) in this thread:<br><br><a href="../general_forum/I think Autofocus is Mark's GTD (in the good sense).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2791408</a></div>

<div class="content">@Paul:<br>No. It actually is Reverse AF2 as Belacqua said.</div>
