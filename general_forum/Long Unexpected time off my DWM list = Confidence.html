<div class="content">Tomorrow I will have recovered from unexpectedly being off of list my DWM list for almost 3 weeks.  I only got back Monday and have taken 2 afternoons off due to Dr. appointments.<br><br>I took Seraphim's earlier suggestion not to re-date the pages, but I didn't just push 3 weeks over the waterfall either.  I just made up my mind to work through as best I could with a goal of closing at least 2 pages a day until I caught up.  Lots got done and lots got dismissed as well.  Dismissal has been a problem in the past.  <br><br>What I learned dealing with this backlog is that I can be brutal with dismissal and the world won't stop!  I think part of it was that mid-week I came across the item to "Review dismissed tasks" and I did it.  That might have been only the second or third time that has stood out.  So here I am swamped with a 3 week backlog of emails and DWM pages and I start looking at dismissed tasks as if I needed more work.  A couple of important tasks got brought back to life (good thing, too!), but it made me really comprehend that dismissed tasks were not gone and no longer available for review.  They can be resurrected and I am likely to review them when it's needed.  Therefore it's OK to dismiss.  <br><br>By the way, I usually don't pay much attention to the dates on my pages except as a guide where to put my tabs for Today, Week, Month.  It was odd having pages in front of my Today tab since I do this in a spiral notebook and remove pages once they have gone over the waterfall.  So the first page is normally my Today  page.  (Pages with dismissed tasks are filed in a folder.)  These excess pages might have been part of the pressure that made it all work.<br><br>I have gained a lot of faith in the system this week.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for posting your experience with rebooting your DWM system.  I've been off the list for some time too, and have been putting off getting back to it because it seems so overwhelming--and of course, every day I put it off the worse it gets :)<br><br>Your post makes it seem more doable.  I'm going to go sit down with some good music and reboot my DWM system right now (because I know I won't if I plan to do it later)</div>
