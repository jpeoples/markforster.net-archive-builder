<div class="content">There is something I smuggle since a few month ie following project and context<br><br>Yes AF4 is a wonderful method. Because it makes getting things done<br>DWM is not silly as well because it obliges yourself to put deadlines about thing and dismiss naturally unusefull stuff<br><br>But what's about following in a glance all tasks about a project ? <br>What's about contexts ? I need to do all my calls and emails at a batch. <br>When I shall buy an ipad I want to have my AF4 list if I can even if I love paper. How can I do it. <br><br>I may have found a solution :<br>I am still testing but I wanted to share it with you immediately ;-)<br><br>1. I use numbers I am a mac user <br>2. I Created 4 colums<br>Contexts = Wait, Call, Mac, Work<br>Tasks = What i have to do and who is concerned <br>ie Mr smith 01 55 25 36 XX  / send proposal<br>Projects = project's name  ie BUILDING XX<br>Deadline = deadline with DWM method (new tasks =+1 month, reported = +7 days)<br>Dashboard for the date<br><br>The list is classified by deadline<br><br>2 tips. (exception about the rules)<br>If something must be done a certain date i put it on. <br>If I need to do something in a week i put it on <br><br>If i need to classified by category (project, context, date) i just click on.numbers column<br><br>Advantage <br>it goes very very fast fast<br>it's easy<br>The control is fantastic<br>it make me see all in a glance<br>I will have it on my ipad then anywhere<br>I can do it on excel too but i prefer number for this<br>I have a strick following of tasks like on AF4 that i love (the list is naturally classified little by little)<br>I dont need to read it again and again just a quick glance of all <br>I can erase immediately what is unusfull<br>I can add contexts ex dismiss ? <br>I can drop anything which happen on the flow without thinking i will see it later<br>The systems is regulated by itself. <br><br>Disadvantage<br>I must use a digital solution, it's better than on paper<br><br>What do you think about it ?</div>

<div class="content">I'm a Mac user too.<br>Have you tried "Things" it works great to link project and contexts.<br>It was my system of choice during the time I was in transition from GTD to AF.</div>

<div class="content">Well, Well I was wrong ! During all the day I was stick and blocked. Nothing advanced an worst i was not creative at all. So I come back to AF4 because AF4 works and much better than anything for me. Anyway i tried ;-)</div>
