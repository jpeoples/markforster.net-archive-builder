<div class="content">Opening a (now successful) Private Therapy Practice<br><br>1. Sick and Tired of being Sick and Tired<br>The ill feelings towards agency work, politics and red tape. "It can't get worse than this" is great motivation to jump ship into the unpredictable world of solopreneurship. <br><br>2. Supportive spouse & supplementary income<br><br>3.  Books & Workshops<br>Taking the time to find the right book and online workshop about running your own private practice<br><br>4. Emotional Support<br>Working with a seasoned therapist <br><br>5. Lessons learned<br>Recalled things I did not enjoy about therapy, personal or otherwise, and tried to do something different with my own practice <br><br>6. Gumption<br>The belief that what worked for me will work for others. A bit evangelical, but the excitement to share ideas got me through many lean times. <br><br>Ok, your turn!</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< In list form, share the tools, ideas, people, etc that contributed to an outcome you're proud of >><br><br>Actually that's not really what reverse engineering means. Tools, ideas and people are all things which are on the surface and observable. Reverse engineering means going below what's observable and working out how it's done. In other words, how did you select those tools, come by those ideas and involve those people? What were the principles you were working on which caused you to do it that way?<br><br>(Later)<br><br>Your answer, which you posted while I was writing mine, addresses this pretty well, better than your description of the rules in fact!</div>
