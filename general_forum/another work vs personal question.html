<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-05-21 14:23</div>
<div class="content">Much as I love AF, I continue to bump up against a specific issue: work vs. home. I've posted on this before and apologize for boring anyone! <br><br>I think I understand the guidance on when to use two lists versus one list - ie., to use different lists for different locations, not for different kinds of tasks. However... I'm fortunate and probably atypical in that I have an office I can use when I want to or need to, but can work from home when I prefer. Most work tasks can be done from either place. This is a wonderful arrangement, allowing me to choose quiet and solitude or the pleasant buzz of the office as I wish... except that it's causing me confusion when it comes to AF! <br><br>I tried two lists but this seemed an unnecessary effort, and illogical, because so many of my work tasks can be done from either location. One list feels much better. But I've realised, as I work through the list, that it matters a lot to me to divide my day into "work time" and "non-work time". In a very unstructured life, this is a key bit of structure for me. <br><br>But of course if I designate a particular period of hours as "work time", then use my Autofocus list, I'll inevitably come across many non-work tasks on my list. What I've been doing is simply ignoring the non-work tasks. But I can't help feeling this interrupts the "standing out" process, by imposing a filter on what's allowed to stand out. <br><br>Do I simply have to choose between a) abandoning any effort to designate "work time" and "non-work time", or b) keeping fixed hours for going into the office, and using two location-specific lists? Or is there a third way? Any thoughts gladly received.<br></div>

<div class="content">I have 3 lists, but I keep them all in one notebook, using a dynamically adjustable split as described here: <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626353" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626353</a><br><br>It works really well for me.</div>

<div class="content">A possible solution is a split up list as proposed, for example there:<br><br>It's very simple. For me I list my personal items from the top of the page (which were the majority over the weekend when I had the idea), but for my work items I start at the bottom of the page and work my way up. When and wherever the two meet, I draw a line in between.<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626353#post626668" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626353#post626668</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Ludlow: It seems to me that you are already applying a "meta-filter" if you like. Work and non-work time are clearly divided in your mind, so why not tag each task on the margin as "W" or "NW'. That way when you are in work mode, you will clearly skip the NW tasks, and allow only the W tasks to stand out to you.<br><br>I use something similar for delegated tasks to my office assistant who comes in once a week. They are peppered thoughout my AF list, and tagged. I apply my mental filter when my assistant comes in, and I discuss the items by picking out the tagged tasks.<br><br>Sometimes, I put in all in a separate task list and have an AF task "Discuss task list with ABC". Depends on what my intuition tells me, and how long the lists are.<br><br>I little inelegant or contrived, but the simple system works for me.</div>

<div class="content">Beth & Damien: I had missed that thread and thanks for the reiteration here. The system is really elegant and simple. I don't really need it now, but if and when I do, it will be really simple to adopt.<br><br>And thanks Ludlow for your original post that drew out these responses.. :)</div>

<div class="content">My issues with this have completely disappeared since I started grouping tasks into project lists where appropriate, e.g. I have 'housework', 'home admin' (bills, finances etc), etc. as project lists (in Evernote in my case). This means that I have one (shorter) list, and if I come across an 'out of context' task, I can take action on it by moving it to a project list. I also have tasks like 'Review home admin'. When I come across one of these I will open up the list and review the tasks. Usually I'll then do at least one of them, but if I'm at work and can't do anything then I've still taken action on the task (By reviewing the list) - which has the effect of keeping it fresh in my mind anyway - and I can then move on.</div>

<div class="content">For me, gradually reducing the differences between work, home, family, etc. helped me to figure out what I wanted to do. The intuition aspect in AF comes more into play, if I don't add much structure to my lists.<br><br>Everything goes into one notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ludlow<br><br>I think you're saying that your concerns are primarily with the work vs home split from a time perspective rather than a list perspective and Norman's comment above echoes what I found. Before AF I always felt that I would be most productive if I kept to a defined work time and home time.  However when starting AF (with 1 list) I found that tasks could stand out in any order.  I had always felt that doing "home" tasks in "work" time was somehow wrong and possibly a form of procrastination, but AF helped to see that the "home" tasks I was addressing were impacting upon my environment, and that actioning them when they stood out freed my mind to focus on my work tasks more easily.<br><br>In the initial weeks of AF I was working my lists from early morning to late at night and did not worry about the order in which tasks stood out.  Whenever possible (although naturally some work issues require intensive time bursts) I still work in that way and find that my day will now naturally fall into the sort of pattern I had tried to force myself into prior to AF.<br><br>My recommendation for what it's worth is not to worry about when you feel you "should" be in work mode or home mode but let the tasks stand out in the order they wish.  If your experience follows mine you will find a natural rhythm develops without too much input from a rational, or imposed perspective.       <br><br></div>

<div class="content">A very good point, Christine. I guess my problem is this: I've tried AF for a good few weeks now, and, well, it is still the case that if I honestly follow my intuition for what is "standing out", I end up powering through a huge number of tiny domestic and organisational tasks, while neglecting harder, more daunting work tasks that are ultimately more important to me.<br><br>This is where I still wonder about the "deep psychology" level of Autofocus. Is it necessarily a given for all of us that if we wait for something to "stand out", the right things will stand out? Could it be that some of us might benefit from a greater degree of rational-brain control? Interesting stuff. Thanks for all the very interesting and useful replies.</div>

<div class="content">I've commented about the same thing, since my work is basically wherever I am, whenever I decide to do it, for the most part. It occurred to me a little while back that Mark's guidance to "use separate notebooks" is really an attempt to address a concept that seems to be missing in Autofocus: contexts.<br><br>Anyone else see this? Ideas on how to address it? I might be out running errands (with my "for everything" notebook) and find myself on a page full of tasks that require that I be at my laptop, and on the internet. As a result, I have to dismiss 'em all and move on to the next page--not that this is a crisis, the other thing I've realized is that my dismissed items are, effectively, the equivalent of my GTD "@Waiting" and "Someday/Maybe" lists, so anything still needing to be done is retrievable, but it seems like it imposes an extra step...<br><br>This is one of the reasons that Mark's description of his new system interested me: since there's no dismissing, and apparently a lot more freedom to move around the pages, I'm wondering whether there's a good way to incorporate the notion of contexts into it...<br><br>(So, Mark, if you're looking for a beta tester for the new system, let me know! ;-> )</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lefty,<br><br>I think you may have missed some of the fine print ;-)<br><br>The separate notebooks does not address "context" but "place" ... i.e. physical location.  Mark uses the example of leaving his work notebook at work and going home to the home notebook.  He can't do tasks on either list in the other place.<br><br>Secondly, you don't have to dismiss tasks just because you can't do them now.  You only dismiss tasks when there is nothing at all you WANT to do on that page.  (There is some discussion about what if you are in the wrong place and there is nothing you CAN do.  Some of us dismiss and readd, others just recognize that is not the intent of dismissal and leave it there until we are in the right place.  YMMV.  And yes, it does add an extra step, so that is why I have chosen to just let the items sit there until I can reasonably do them.)<br><br>As to "contexts", I ran away from GTD screaming because of that insanity ;-)  I did find it useful to have some "lists" for specific things such as a shopping list, a list of things to discuss with my wife, etc.  But context had nothing at all to do with it.  I might cull out items from my list that I will do this weekend out in the yard.  That is not a context list but just an ordinary list of things to do on Saturday in the yard.  I also have a "hot list" of the things I MUST do today and I put that on a Post-it on my book's cover or on an index card.<br><br>As to beta testers ... I think the whole list is a beta test group.  (Unless Mark does not beta test his new idea.)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ludlow<br><br>That's a very good question about the "right" things standing out.  My gut reaction is that yes the right things do stand out but - and this is a big but - if we are not in the right place vis-a-vis backlogs and/or other situations then we may need to override that with a more rational approach.  I know this goes against AF and that there will probably be a lot of people who will disagree with me on this.<br><br>I firmly believe that the best approach is to use AF exactly as per the instructions and trust the system that the right things will stand out.  I have certainly found this to be true time and time again - even though things I thought should stand out did not.  The system did prove itself right.<br><br>However I think that, if we really do trust the system, we will find that there are areas of our life, or our working practices, that we need to change.  That may mean changing jobs, letting go of some of our obligations, or finally addressing a backlog or some other issue that has been holding us back.<br><br>Although AF will enable us to identify those issues, the responsibility for acting on those factors lies with us and there may be a lead in time before we can action whatever we need to do to clear our path forward.  If we are in the wrong job for example, those tasks may never stand out.  We may therefore have to use a more rational approach to action them until such time as we can change the circumstances.<br><br>In my case my backlog is causing me immense problems and to move forward I need to clear it.  I still have some resistance to it but nowhere near as much as when I started AF - in fact I genuinely want to clear it, and as quickly as possible - the main issue now is that it is boring!!  I am fortunate in that I have found a way to handle that type of scenario within AF but there is of necessity a more rational choosing of that project rather than purely allowing it to stand out.  That in turn has an impact on the rest of my list.<br><br>Hope that may help?  Also remember that sometimes we do need to get some of the domestic and organisational tasks out of the way to free up our creativity to address the bigger projects - or just to reorganise those projects themselves.</div>

<div class="content">But Mike, place _is_ a context, isn't it? A "context", as I see it, is a collection of situations which are prerequisites for doing a given task. In other words, if one of my tasks is "fix the bathroom faucet", I can only do that at home. Similarly, if one of my tasks is "reply to an email", then I need to a) have a computer and b) have a connection to the net. I had contexts "@Home" and "@Internet" to cover these situations.<br><br>Contexts should be broad enough to be useful, but focused enough to be applicable to your situation.<br><br>Unless I missed a reply from Mark to the contrary, which is certainly possible, the instructions for Autofocus say nothing at all about "WANT to do" or "CAN do"; they simply say "stand out". If there's nothing on the page which it's possible for me to do, whether it "stands out" or not, I'm unable to do it. As I understand the system, to go on to the next page, I need to dismiss the current page (and, as I noted, that's okay).<br><br>So, I'm not sure I "missed" any "fine print"; I'm wondering whether you might have invented some, though. Can you point me to a place where Mark suggests not dismissing things that you're unable to do at the time you're looking at them and going on to the next page anyway?</div>

<div class="content">Okay, I went back and _looked_, Mike, and Mark very specifically (in the posting at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/764172)" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/764172)</a> says precisely the contrary of what you're saying: ''...it's important to remember that when you change a rule you also change the way your intuition approaches the list as a whole. If your rule is that you will only dismiss an item if it relates to your current context, then that is going to affect how you approach that item on previous passes through that page, and consequently how you approach the other items on the same page. And because your intuition is looking at the list as a whole as well as the page you are currently on, the rule change will affect the way you approach every item on the list."<br><br>He goes on to say, "of course situations do arise when I am not able to do any of the tasks on a page for some reason or other. In which case I dismiss them."<br><br>So, no, I don't seem to have "missed" any "fine print", other than that which didn't, apparently, exist in the first place...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lefty,<br><br>No, a place is not a context.  A context is some kind of jumble of partly defined ideas including place, time, energy level, equipment, people, resources, etc.  That is what made it such a nightmare.<br><br>Yes, my faucet requires that I be at home to fix it.  But it also requires a wrench, time, inclination, information, etc.  That is the real problem ... a context is whatever someone things it is.  Not a very good way to approach planning and management.<br><br>As to Mark's take on it, we were discussing it in another thread and I don't recall what he thought.  It seems to me he was dismissing and re-adding when the time came on the basis that he had a bunch of chances to do the thing in the past so if not yet done, it should be dismissed.  I think he also thought it a good motivation to think that you might find yourself on a page with only tasks you could not do ... so you should do them the first time you COULD.  Others have different takes and, of course, you should ask Mark directly for his ideas.</div>

<div class="content">One frustration I had with GTD was not having a guided way to *switch* contexts.  <br><br>For example, I am working my @Computer list.  It is essentially endless.  I could spend *days* working that list.<br><br>Or I am working my @Home list.  Again, I have an essentially endless list here.  There are so many projects to do outside, so many repairs and odds and ends I could do inside.  <br><br>My frustration with GTD was that, while working my list in one of these "contexts", I would be anxiously worried that maybe I *really* should be working on something on one of my other context lists!<br><br>You could try "time blocking" for this.  This works great for me if I keep it very general -- e.g., "work" and "personal".   But how detailed are you going to get?  Should I create a timeblock for each and every context?  (@Home, @Calls, @Wife, @Outside, @Computer, @Desk, @Work, @Errands).  It just gets nonsensical and totally arbitrary.<br><br>AF solved that problem for me.  The "standing out" process helps prompt me when it's the right time to switch contexts.  E.g., I'm at my computer, and for awhile, all the "computer" tasks are standing out, since it just naturally works that way.  But then, after while, "wash the dishes" stands out.  So, maybe it's time to leave the computer and go wash some dishes.  This just works great.  And it doesn't need any special context tagging.</div>

<div class="content">Another thing.<br><br>At first, I tried using one single AF list for everything.  But I started having trouble, since I had lots of urgent personal tasks at the time, and I'd find myself whittling away the day on my personal tasks.  But, I am an employee, and even though I work at home, I need to be focused on work tasks for the bulk of the day.  An occasional break, even a lengthy one, to work on personal stuff is fine -- but it's just not acceptable (to me or to my employer!) to give only a fraction of the day to my paid work.<br><br>So, I quickly learned that I needed to switch to two books -- one for personal, one for work.  That worked much better, for several months.<br><br>But now, I'm back to a single book.  I'm using the method of listing work items from the top down,  and personal items from the bottom up, and drawing a line where they meet in the middle.  <br><br>I think the reason it's working now, even though it didn't work earlier, is because AF has become a totally essential and dependable system for me.  I write everything in there, and trust that it will get done eventually.  It's really working for me, and I have confidence that the right things will get done at the right time.  I didn't really have that confidence before, so I always gravitated towards the urgent and pressing tasks, which generally happen to be my personal tasks.  <br><br>Now, having everything in one list again, I find it's easy to focus on the work tasks during work time, but still nice to see what other things I need to be thinking about when I have some personal time.  And sometimes, those personal things really do stand out, and I realize I've been neglecting them, and need to take a long lunch break to deal with them, or maybe even take half a vacation day or something to push through some of them.<br><br>One reason I like AF so much, is it helps me balance all of this, without arbitrary time blocks or rules.  It all works very naturally, without needing to force-fit anything into an arbitrary structure.</div>

<div class="content">Totally agree with you Seraphim - that's just what I love about AF.  If I feel any need to group specific tasks into contexts, then I retain them within AF but jot them into a separate list and add that to AF .  So I could have "call x", "call y" "call z" scattered throughout my list and also have a task "calls".  If "calls" stood out then i would action the calls from my calls list, work with that list "for as long as I felt" and cross off any calls made when I reached them on the next pass through the list.</div>
