<div class="content">Some speculations on "what stands out"...<br><br>Mark's "future vision" exercise in "Dreams" works well with this.  But needs to be coupled with self-trust and faith  to acknowledge the impulses to act that come from it.<br><br>"what stands out" can be an impulse from your non-intellectual / creative inner self, urging toward action; such impulses need faith, for they urge action in the faith that the moment for action exists. Self-trust allows you try more impulses out, to see where they lead you by allowing them some freedom of expression.<br><br>After a while you perceive a direction in which impulses lead, and feel yourself exert power in the world through such unplanned, non-intellectual - but rational - actions. impulses are invitations to action, satisfaction of values in the "future vision".</div>
