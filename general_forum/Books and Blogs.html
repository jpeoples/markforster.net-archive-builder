<div class="content">Hey Guys,<br> <br>Over the last year or so, I've been a lurker on this forum and have greedily devoured your posts and all of Mark's excellent books. <br><br>The stuff I've learnt here is so much more different than the obsessive GTD type 'one size fits all'  time management methods peddled out there.<br><br>I just wished to ask if there were other Blogs/Forums/Books that have such an alternative and unconventional approaches to time management like the ones discussed here.<br><br>If such information exists, I'd be obliged if someone listed it out here.<br><br>Thank You.</div>

<div class="content">Nicki,<br><br>It might not be what you are looking for but I first thought of the book "Deep Work" by Cal Newport  when you mentioned "alternative approaches " I have been greatly influenced by the book and his blog is one that I have searched quite a bit for unique ideas  on how to approach things.  My main take-away was to work on ways to focus longer without distractions <br><br>I'm also glad you asked because it prompted me to think of other books (besides Mark's of course) that have helped me in the pursuit of getting better at doing...  One I have referred to often is "The Practicing Mind" by Thomas Sterner.  Chapter 6 seems to especially apply where he talks about the 4 'S' words: simplify, small, short, and slow. I really liked how he described a work day where he focuses on delibertly going slow and methodically and was surprised that he actually finished everything  faster by simplifying and going slower.<br><br>Remembering these two books was a timely reminder for me that sometimes it is about my.mindset not just my tools or algorithms.<br><br>Brent</div>

<div class="content">Brent, thanks for the referral to "The Practicing Mind". I decided to get it on Audible and have been listening to it for a couple days. <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/The-Practicing-Mind-Audiobook/B004BU7RH4" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.audible.com/pd/The-Practicing-Mind-Audiobook/B004BU7RH4</a><br><br>Many of the ideas jive really well with the No-List method I've been using lately. <a href="../general_forum/More experimenting with intuition and focus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2730943</a><br><br>Some other books that have helped me with time management and related topics (in no particular order):<br>- Tom DeMarco - Slack<br>- Clarke Ching - The Bottleneck Rules <br>- Tim Harford - Messy - The Power of Disorder to Transform our Lives<br>- Eli Goldratt - The Choice<br>- Charles Duhigg - The Power of Habit<br>- Stephen Covey - The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People<br>- Peter F Drucker - The Effective Executive<br>- Andy Core - Change Your Day, Not Your Life<br><br>Some of them have one or two key ideas that really could have been communicated in an article. I'm thinking Andy Core's book especially. The book seems kind of repetitive after you grasp the initial concept.<br><br>Speaking of articles - here are a couple good ones:<br>- Dave Snowden, "A Leader's Framework for Decision Making" (on the Cynefin Framework) - <a href="http://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making</a>   Also see the Wikipedia entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework</a><br>- Jane Wesman, "Time Management: The Simplest System" - <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html</a></div>

<div class="content">I second The Practicing Mind.  I have that on Audible and have listened to chapter 6 probably 50 times by now.  I practice the piano every day for a hobby, so his principles I can really relate to.  He actually has a follow-up book called Fully Engaged that's pretty good.</div>

<div class="content">18 Minutes.  The first book I've ever seen on setting your direction that actually had workable advice.  I've seen many books on setting direction, but they were all too high-falutin' and none practical.  This book is extremely practical and drives from ideas and attitudes you can easily master towards habits you can easily and successfully implement.</div>

<div class="content">Alan - Thanks for mentioning << 18 minutes >> -- I've got that audiobook but somehow never listened to it!  It's next in line after << The Practicing Mind >>. :-)<br><br>Here are a couple more really interesting and insightful books:<br>Don Reinertsen << The Principles of Product Development Flow >><br>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi << Flow >></div>

<div class="content">These books sound great! I think I'll listen, read, or Kindle little bits of all of them at random over the next ten years. ;D</div>

<div class="content">And if you are a member of a public library, you can download Libby and listen to the audiobooks for free. Library restrictions vary, with mine it automatically returns after 14 days but when you "take it out" again it continues where you left off.</div>

<div class="content">From the mentioned books I second «Flow» by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. It is one of the most important books I read in my life.<br><br>Online and more to the point of "unconventional approaches to time management," I want to suggest to blogs.<br><br>1. Dave Seah developed productivity forms like the Concrete Goals Tracker<br><br><a href="http://davidseah.com/productivity-tools/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://davidseah.com/productivity-tools/</a><br><br>2. Matthew Cornell stopped blogging, but he has an archive worth browsing. <br><br>Featuring an interview with our very Mark Forster: <br><a href="http://www.matthewcornell.org/blog/2006/11/17/a-conversation-with-mark-forster.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.matthewcornell.org/blog/2006/11/17/a-conversation-with-mark-forster.html</a><br><br>A concise definition of what productivity actually is:<br><a href="http://www.matthewcornell.org/blog/2007/10/9/a-conversation-with-laura-stack-the-productivity-pro.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.matthewcornell.org/blog/2007/10/9/a-conversation-with-laura-stack-the-productivity-pro.html</a><br><br>And also a review of another methodology "Mission Control":<br><a href="http://www.matthewcornell.org/blog/2006/7/5/a-gtd-ers-perspective-on-mission-controls-productivity-and-a.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.matthewcornell.org/blog/2006/7/5/a-gtd-ers-perspective-on-mission-controls-productivity-and-a.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Just picking up Essentialism based on recommendation elsewhere. Get Everything Dine by defining Everything as just what is Essential, the things you can do that make the biggest difference.</div>

<div class="content">Alan Baljeu:<br><br><< Essential, the things you can do that make the biggest difference. >><br><br>Without having read the book, my problem with approaches like that is that "the things you can do to make the biggest difference" is not the correct definition of essential.<br><br>Tidying your desk is essential, as you will quickly find out if you don't do it. Likewise a myriad of small, medium and large tasks which will make a huge difference if you _don't_ do them.<br><br>But no doubt he covers all that in his book.</div>

<div class="content">I should retract my definition, it's not how it's explained in the book.  But it is very much about having a strictly narrowed focus so you do less, but better.</div>
