<div class="content">I think this is also a useful question. While I use and like AF, the fact is that for months before I started AF, I had a clear desk and processed all my email every day. In the months since, my desk has been untidy, and my email cleared about once a week.<br><br>This is because I don't like either task, and AF allows me to choose alternatives.<br><br>Of course it is harder to answer this question, as one does not know what would have happened without AF, in many cases. Prior to AF, I was using, like many here, DIT.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence,<br><br>you mention two problems, untidy desk and e-mail not checked. Since these two things obviously are not to your liking, why don't you just take them out of AF (since you obviously cannot dismiss them) and put them on a  daily checklist?</div>

<div class="content">As Mark indicated elsewhere, the issue should be about outcomes not process. So, has there been a deleterious outcome arising from desk and emails not being cleared every day? If not, is there a problem? If yes, has the frequency of the task being done changed within AF.<br><br>It may be that this observation is just a result of your subconscious telling you that you don't need to do these tasks more often.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence<br><br>What I have found with AF is that by seemingly creating backlog situations it is merely highlighting an issue.  You realise you do not like checking email - your method previously was to schedule it - which worked well for you.  However you now have the opportunity to see if there is a better way.  I got to exactly the same poistion with my email and realised that by "just doing it" I was not addressing the issue, which was that I had more email coming in than I could realistically deal with in any given day.  I therefore looked at that mail and took decisions to (a) cancel some subscriptions (b) set up rules to (i) instantly file certain newsletters so that I can review them in my own time and (ii) categorise emails so that I can scan and action specific groups of mail in isolation and (c) changed the way I check and action email.  That change has significantly impacted my email in that I don't end up with the massive backlogs I had previously (with erratic time availability previously I "declared a DIT backlog" with alarming regularity!) yet feel in control of my mail.<br><br>Laurence it may be that the best method for you is to "just do it" by scheduling but be aware that AF gives you the space to look at the question "is there a better way?"</div>

<div class="content">Good responses, all. I am not sure if there have been any adverse consequences so far, and I am hoping and expecting things to settle down. I am aware that some here (including Mark Forster briefly) have addressed this issue with an additional index card, but I would prefer to stay with pure AF if possible.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence:<br><br>Presumably since you use and like AF you've found that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of having an untidy desk and uncleared email. Can you give us any idea what those advantages might be?</div>

<div class="content">Laurence, I have the same issue where I now have an email backlog at work, and mine was clear for YEARS before doing AF.  Today, as year end is over, I'm going to sort it into different subcategories / projects and put those onto my AF list at work.  <br><br>Part of my issue is that an email will come in, and I'm not sure what to do on the project because I'm new at the job, and the ways of getting things done are foreign to me (who's responsible for what?)  But it's not just the newness of it, as other people who have been here for years don't know who's responsible for what.  It's hard to even write a task that makes any sense to me on my list, I'll go back and look at tasks I've written and can't recall what was supposed to be done.<br><br>It also seems like people outside my faculty are starting to rely on me to push to get things done at a lower level which aren't really my job to do - so I'm having to micro-manage a few people in my faculty who are kind of incompetent - which is not the way I like to do things.  Lots of follow-ups and all that - it's frustrating.  I am now in a task-oriented world where before I was in a large project type of world, and it's hard for my brain to make the leap.  <br><br>I really don't like having anything in my inbox at all, as I've operated with it as a to do list of sorts for a long time.  I even feel some anxiety when I go to other people's desks and see their inboxes (which are always full)!  :-)<br><br>I actually used to like clearing my inbox, but now that I have a backlog, I don't like it at all.  <br></div>

<div class="content">A messy desk and a desk full of stuff is not necessarily the same thing.<br><br>My desk is more crowded, too, since I started using AF. But it's all stuff related to ongoing projects. I know where everything is and belongs to. It LIVES.<br><br>Before, my desk was filled with things I actually had forgotten to put somewhere else or had no place to put them. Things I ignored, things I blinded out. BALLAST.<br><br>On a photo, you would not see much difference before versus after. But it FEELS totally different.<br><br>And after all, a clean desk was never my goal.</div>

<div class="content">What have I failed to achieve since starting AF?  I failed to achieve completion of a clutter clearing project I had started last year and I failed to complete a backlog project I also started last year.  However, that was because I realised that there were more important areas to deal with and I know I will be better placed to deal with them at a later date.<br><br>I have failed to exceed my procrastination targets and I have failed to exceed my previous levels of worry and anxiety (except very occasionally when I try very hard!)<br><br>There are a number of things I have not achieved that I believed I ought to, but when I genuinely examined them they were not as important as I thought.  There are some things I have not achieved that I still would like to have done - BUT the amount I have achieved so far outweighs those as to make them almost immaterial.  My email occasionally creeps up to a higher level than I would like, but when I look at it objectively, that level is so far below what I used to have as a regular backlog that I realise that my acceptable standards are now higher.  In any event I know that the content of those emails is not urgent, because I deal with urgent email, just leave my reading and filing for a while longer.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - What I like most about AF, is that whatever I am doing, I am in the flow, i.e. without resistance, which must make for more efficiency on that particular task in the long run, per unit of attention.<br><br>What is happening is that my attention is getting spread about more, while at the same time the quality of that attention is improving. This means that ultimately things should get done better, and more things get done - but it will take longer to get them done in calendar terms. For this reason I have considered adding some kind of filter or buffer to regulate how much or what gets added to the system, though I would prefer not to add this left brain activity if possible.<br><br>As you see, although I have been using AF for three months now, I am still pondering its benefits and possible ways to improve it. So in a nutshell, I am doing it because I really like it, and that, rightly or wrongly, may be the main advantage for me so far!<br><br>Jacqueline, glad to know someone else has experienced the same re desk and email. Clearing these was really good for morale.<br><br>Christine - accurate observations as ever. Perhaps the main benefit of Mark's latest system is that we are forced to examine ourselves, and as Aristotle said, the unexamined life is not worth living.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence<br><br>I really like the way you describe the increase in efficiency as relating to the feeling of being "in the flow".<br><br>The longer you use AF the more you can look back and see "how" it has changed things.  I have posted before about how AF identifies reasons for resistance, and that we then have to choose whether or not to act on that knowledge.  When I look back at the areas where I have struggled with AF I believe that they relate almost exclusively to areas where, for whatever reason, I have chosen not to act on that knowledge.  <br><br>About two weeks ago I made the decision to act on something AF had shown me pretty early on which resulted in my dumping several hundred items into AF to address a particular issue.  I started that process on 21 March at which time I had 521 open tasks.  That crept up to 708 over the period but today, when I completed the bulk of that project, my number of open tasks is currently standing at 482 - less than when I started that exercise (and actually less than when I started keeping detailed statistics on 23 February.  Clearing that backlog was not without a degree of boredom (and lots of cups of coffee!) so I cannot say I was always in the flow, but the resistance level was low, and the fear factor significantly reduced.  <br><br>Only one more significant backlog to address now ...... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Oooh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this anymore!  - but it's Socrates who said that 'the unexamined life wasn't worth living" - and he said that because he was brought on trial for heresy and challenging the beliefs of the day.   I wouldn't say he was speaking so much in terms of introspection as we commonly think this quote is about - as much as he was defending philosophical inquiry.  <br><br>Sorry, I just love those old philosopher guys.  :-)</div>
