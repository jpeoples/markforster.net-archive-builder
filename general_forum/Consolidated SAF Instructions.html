<div class="content">I'm getting ready to try Mark's new "Super AutoFocus" (SAF), and decided to consolidate his AF1 instructions with the new Super (right-column) rules.  Here is my interpretation, as a seven-step process. Please (Mark, especially) correct anything that is wrong in my interpretation.<br><br>Super AutoFocus (SAF) by Mark Forster<br>(instructions consolidated by ubi)<br><br>0. STARTUP. Make one long list of every task to be done, in the left column of each page in a multipage notebook. Start working by considering the first page of the list to be the current page.<br><br>1. PAGE-SET. Mark the current page in some way (e.g. with a paperclip). Add any new task that comes to mind to the end of the list (last page, left column), unless it is urgent or irresistible. Add any urgent or irresistible tasks to the right column of the current page. If these right-column tasks were already entered on other pages, the duplicate entries may be crossed on these other pages, either immediately or later.<br><br>2. QUICK-SCAN. Scan the tasks on the current page (left column, then right column) without doing any of them.<br><br>3. STANDOUT-ACTION. Scan again and choose a task to do. Mark it with a dot. Work on it for as long as desired. Cross it out.<br><br>4. REWRITE. If the task isn't finished, rewrite it in the right column of the same page (or of the next page if there isn't room). If it is finished for now, but is a recurring task that will need doing again in the future, rewrite it at the end of the list (left column).<br><br>5. SAME-PAGE. Continue working the current page in this way (Steps 2-3) until no task stands out. If it seems that only one right-column (unfinished) task will stand out for the time being, cross it out and move it to the right column of the next page.<br><br>6. NEXT-PAGE. Go to the next page and continue the process (Steps 1-5). If the current page is the last page, the "next page" becomes the first page. This process keeps cycling, except in the special circumstance of Step 7…<br><br>7. DISMISS/REVIEW. If nothing stands out on the initial scan of a page, dismiss all the remaining tasks on the page by highlighting them instead of crossing them out. Add a task called "review dismissed tasks" to the end of the list. When eventually reviewing each of these dismissed tasks, think about why it wasn't actioned, and consider carefully whether it should be re-entered. If re-entering, consider rephrasing it or breaking it into subtasks, to make it more likely to get done. Finally, cross out the dismissed and reviewed tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I am confused about this: when you have a partially full left column on a page, and you work on a task and re-enter it, do you put it directly in the right column (#4 above), or do you add it below in the left column and only add it to the right column if the left column is already full?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ubi -- thanks for that effort. I have the same point to make as George. I think the right hand column is meant for task over-flows when the left hand side is full.</div>

<div class="content">George/JD::  No, I believe Ubi is correct as per his text:<br><br><Add any new task that comes to mind to the end of the list (last page, left column), unless it is urgent or irresistible. Add any urgent or irresistible tasks to the right column of the current page.><br><br>So a re-entered task can be written at the bottom of the partially full left column if it is no longer pressing or irresistible.<br><br>I think this brings to the fore again what constitutes a task and what is 'completed' work.  I have found myself increasingly particular about trying to define how far I want to go in my description when I enter it, without being too pedantic or impractical.<br><br>As others have pointed out elsewhere, projects generally have the work broken down (WBS is the official tag, I think, in project management terminology) into smaller tasks which can be drawn into the main AF or SAF from the task list for each project.</div>

<div class="content">With regard to the entry of tasks on the last page, my own view is that you would normally re-enter unfinished tasks in the right column (Column 2) so as to maintain their status in your mind, but that there is little point in entering "urgent" or irresistible" tasks there since they are already on the active page and therefore don't need any added priority.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi:<br><br>That's a pretty good summary of the rules. I particularly like para 5, where you've managed to say it much more simply than I did!<br><br>One thing you've left out is the second part of my Rule 4.</div>

<div class="content">Mark/Ubi/All:<br><br>Although I mentioned on the other SAF thread that I'm watching and waiting, I am getting the feeling that this SAF is, but the latest culmination of nearly two years of development and feedback on the Forum.  As Mark as done the most development and driven the whole thing - most of the rest of us have been tweaking, really - when he says the productivity improvement is a big leap, I'm inclined to go along with him.<br><br>NEVER have I ever stayed with one approach to task/time management for such a prolonged period, and never have I made such progress, and I must be one of the older members.<br><br>So, here's my contribution to number five which could perhaps be expressed thus:<br><br>Ubi's revision to Mark's: <br>5. SAME-PAGE. Continue working the current page in this way (Steps 2-3) until no task stands out. If it seems that only one right-column (unfinished) task will stand out for the time being, cross it out and move it to the right column of the next page.<br><br>My own revision to Ubi's revision:<br>5. SAME-PAGE. Continue working the current page in this way (Steps 2-3) until no task stands out at all in either column.  If so, dismiss everything else in both columns.  If there is ONE task in the right-hand column that stands out, dismiss everything else in the left and right columns, then cross out this one right-hand task and move it to the right column of the next page.<br><br>Ok?</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Roger J,<br><br><<5. SAME-PAGE. Continue working the current page in this way (Steps 2-3) until no task stands out at all in either column.

Wait a minute, I do not think one should dismiss ALL the items in a page after working on it.  That's not how AF1 works.  In AF1 you work on a page until nothing else stands out, then you just go to the next page; you leave the previous page alone until you come back to it.   You only dismiss a page when you get to it fresh from the previous page and nothing stands out.  If I understand SAF's new rules, that dismissal rule has TWO modes now: <br><br>(1) When you come to a page fresh from the previous page, and nothing stands out in the said page, then you dismiss the whole page---both Columns 1 and 2.<br>(2) When you come to a page fresh from the previous page, and nothing stands out EXCEPT a task at Column2, then pick out the task standing out in Column 2, cross it out, write the task in the next page's Column 2, then dismiss the whole page from which that task came from --- both Columns 1 and 2.  You then work on the rewritten task in the next page.<br><br>Is this right, Mark?<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Roger:<br><br>Ubi's para 5 is not a revision of my rule. It is the same rule expressed in different language (and perhaps a bit more clearly).<br><br>Your revision on the other hand is not so much a revision as a completely different system. Do you really want to dismiss everything left on a page after the first time you work on it? That's what you're saying.</div>

<div class="content">Just as well I'm a bit thick-skinned, lots of chastisement coming my way,<br><br>Sorry, I NOT mean dismissal on the FIRST pass, but per the rules of AF1.<br><br>As 'someone' wrote, not easy to write clear rules, no wonder the world's in a mess!<br><br>nuntym: your response adds the clarity mine is lacking.<br><br>To be fair, Mark, on printing out the rules from original AF1 and AF4, I reckon your explanation for AF1 was pretty comprehensive, but subesquent versions and their 'preliminary' rules were not at the same level, more incremental, yet understandable for the trailblazers.  Perhaps out 'experience' and tweaks across the various versions has made us more adaptable than absolute newbies.<br><br>Would any brand new aficionados like to comment?</div>

The trouble is that the longer and more comprehensive the instructions are, the less likely people are to read them properly.<br><br>So far I've kept the SuperFocus instructions on the Forum rather than the Blog just so that they can be trialed by the aficionados.</div>

<div class="content">Just a slightly irreverent observation triggered by Mark's comment about ppl misunderstanding AF1... Would the afficianadoes forums.created less misunderstandings if the almighty had used them in releasing the bible?   No harm intended just imagining the forums.... ... "pardon, yr holiness...but when you say banished (or dismissal)  did you mean...this or that"</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I'm glad you think I captured most of the approach.  Regarding the second part of your Rule 4, I left it out intentionally, because I didn't know how to capture it succinctly. Also, selfishly, I didn't think it would come up in my work. I await your official consolidated instructions.<br><br>Some of the new right-column rules seem like a structured way to follow  your earlier "common-sense" advice; i.e., if something needs (or wants) doing immediately, just do it. The rest are about finishing a task already started on the current page. Rule 4(b) seems geared toward avoiding just pushing a single task from page to page, without doing or dismissing any other tasks. But if you find yourself in this predicament, isn't it clear that there is one overriding task that you had better finish? If this is the case, common sense would dictate putting away your list and getting on with it, rather than crossing out and rewriting descriptions of it, no?</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Nah, Mary, no matter how good any instructions manual is written, there will always be people who will misunderstand it.  There is no limit to human stupidity, you  know (and I admit, I am can be pretty stupid too oftentimes ^__^).  However, as the late Pope John Paul II said, stupidity is a gift from God too, and we must not misuse it, which we do when we do not learn and ask ^___^<br><br>When it comes to the Holy Bible, that's why there's the official interpreter, the one who originally compiled it: the Church.  But I digress.<br><br>God bless!</div>

The purpose of the rule is to give the task other tasks to alternate with. It's the equivalent in 3-T of replenishing the list when you are down to one task.</div>

<div class="content">mary and nuntym:<br><br>The Bible is a lot nearer to an aficionados' forum than perhaps mary appreciates. Only a small part of it is rules. The rest is the record of a whole load of people trying to live those rules, succeeded at it, failing at it, ignoring them, amending them, misinterpreting them, trying their own thing and coming completely unstuck on occasions. Sounds familiar?<br><br>It starts off with just one rule: You can do whatever you like, just so long as you don't eat the fruit from that tree over there. Couldn't be simpler.</div>
