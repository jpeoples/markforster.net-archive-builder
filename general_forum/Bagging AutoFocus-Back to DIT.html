<div class="content">I found my schedule to be too regimented and deadline driven to effectively incorporate the AF system.  I've tried twice, both times were unsuccessful.  I believe this system is best when you probably have lots of discretionary time and fewer deadlines to meet.  <br><br>Another particular-once I was staring down the sheer volume of my work on a sheet, it actually demotivated me and freaked me out.  DIT I was looking at a closed list, one day at a time approach which seemed psychologically to be easier to handle.  Knowing I have 14 sheets of work to go through is unsettling to me, with AF.  <br><br>Just my 2 cents, I hope that DIT continues to be a part of this forum, it seems like most threads these days relate to AF.</div>

<div class="content">Hi TK<br><br>I get the impression that there's an awful lot of people who love the structure of DIT and DIT is too good a system in it's own right to disappear!  AF does work best with discretionery time.  I loved DIT but was never disciplined enough to keep up with it - perhaps I had too much discretionery time?  Now there's a point for discussion - does DIT work better without discretionery time? .......  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I've always been self-driven to beat deadlines within a deadline-oriented world but couldn't stick to DIT on a regular basis.  I have reverted back to it when working on yearend this month.  I think I just like knowing everything I've committed to is in one tracking place.   And I've never wanted to abandon my tendency to do things immediately as soon as they come in - which AF allows (if your list is smaller) and DIT specifically prevents.  If my boss says jump, I'm the type that drops everything and says "how high?"  Kind of a bad habit some would say, but I've received too many raises without asking for them or "Above and Beyond" bonuses to change.  I still think DIT and AF can work together, it's working very well in the way that I'm using it at work right now.  <br><br>It seems to be the structure that appeals to people who like DIT.  And you have to be able to schedule yourself I think.  Unless I do have a deadline of sorts, I for one cannot schedule myself to save my soul.  <br><br>My guess is when Mark comes back and if he presents his ideas on a method that's a cross between AF and DIT, there will be a flurry of people trying out the modified AF/DIT combo and renewed interest in DIT as well.  I hope you stick around for that TK.  <br><br>All the best!!!<br></div>

<div class="content">I started trying Autofocus in early January.  While I had read Mark's first book, I had never read "Do It Tomorrow."  It wasn't available at first in the US and then I just forgot about it.  But after reading so much about DIT on this forum and not being totally satisfied with Autofocus, I decided to read it.  I am almost finished.  <br><br>I have decided that I want to do some sort of hybrid between DIT and Autofocus.  In my opinion, they both have their limitations, but I haven't tried DIT yet so don't feel I can really judge that system.  With Autofocus, I found I was more productive but wasn't necessarily getting the RIGHT things done.  I have some very large projects which I just wasn't getting to often enough while the smaller items were being done.  I'm not totally sure how DIT will change this.  I have NO idea how much is a full day's work for me, as I always seem to be in a backlog.  I like the flexibility of AF, so I don't want to bag it altogether.  I really hope Mark does come up with a hybrid system.<br><br>If anyone has any suggestions for how I might combine AF and DIT, I would appreciate it.  I plan to keep the AF lists (I actually divided the list into 4 parts for the 4 distinct parts of my life (work, school, Toastmasters, and home/other), but will likely consolidate that into 2 or 3 areas (my leadership work in Toastmasters is winding down but school will soon be ramping up).  I am thinking I will start with having my "will do" list very small and definitely do the primary objective first thing each day.  I want to breed success, as I still feel like a failure.  I will likely still use AF once I finish my "will do" list each day.  I am definitely open to suggestions, though... I have only posted to this forum a few times but read the posts at least a few times per week and have found it helpful.  Many thanks!</div>

<div class="content">One way that might be successful, as others have mentioned, is to have a DIT closed list and then use AF for discretionary time.  So something like this:<br>8a-12p DIT closed list tasks<br>12p-2p AF discretionary time<br>2p-6p DIT closed list tasks<br><br>I would imagine the trick would be figuring out the workload time for the closed lists first, that way you can actually complete the closed list items in a day.  Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">I too am finding similar difficulties, and agree that "with Autofocus, I found I was more productive but wasn't necessarily getting the RIGHT things done. I have some very large projects which I just wasn't getting to often enough while the smaller items were being done"<br><br>I am writing a book.  In December and January, I made good progress. In February, I did many little things, marvelling how AF had allowed me to get done things that I had procrastinated for years.  But little progress on the book.  In March, I'm nearly finished with the book, by focussing on it to the exclusion of other things.<br><br>While not canning AF altogether, I am moving towards identifying a priority for the month and using DIT to make it happen (close to the current initiative) and using AF for everything else when time permits.  <br><br>I've also been experimenting with setting themes for days, weeks or months.  For example, I am chairman of my organisation.  Once a week, I'll go through my AF looking for tasks relevant to that theme. Other items which don't match the theme don't have to get dismissed on that pass through the list.   Occassionally one must have themeless passes through the list in which items might get dismissed.<br><br>One thing I am noticing is that since the book has displaced the AF list this month, a lot of the tasks on it now seem stale and pointless. Did I ever write that down?  Whatever could I have been thinking?   DIT addresses this by putting a buffer of a day between thinking of a task and doing it, but I'm getting to wonder whether it's long enough.</div>

<div class="content">As I wrote in another post, I am one of the hybrid fans as well:<br><br>My setup is the task diary for fixed appointments then smaller things that need to be accomplished that day then my current initiative.<br><br>With the current initiative I have actually borrowed from someone else. Leo Babauta suggests in his Zen to Done to select 3 most important tasks and take care of these first thing. I find this more helpful but the two approaches are of course not necessarily exclusive since the current initiative is more of a multi-task project.<br><br>Whatever is left after these things are done will then be used to work on my AF list that serves also as my master list. Everything I need to do goes in there first (unless I need to do it tomorrow). If I enter things in the task diary I can delete them from the AF list.<br><br>The advantages are, that I have all my tasks written down somewhere, nothing needs to be rewritten or only very seldom. I always find the most important things to do in my task diary.<br><br>On the other hand I am still able to use the intuitive little and often approach of AF since my given tasks rarely occupy more than half a day.</div>

<div class="content">I agree that it is often neceassry to do urgent and important items off list (and the common sense rule is there to ensure that) but I personally found that it was the unexpected things that got done that were the biggest revelation in identifying what was really important to me.  On the face of it, it could be felt that I was not getting the RIGHT things done as certainly some "urgent and important" items were not actioned when I felt they "ought" to be.  However it was that very process that gave me the most advances with using AF and identifying HOW it works.  Going back to a system with the structure may be necessary in those areas where we don't have a lot of control (work environments particularly) but as AF works intuitively and identifies issues that rationally we would never get to, there is a real danger of missing some of those benefits.<br><br>OK, I know I use one list, so have home and work tasks mixed, and being home based can do anything at anytime to a large extent.  However it was the very doing of mundane tasks - that were seemingly totally unimportant in the scheme of things, that enabled me to identify "how" I worked, what factors influenced my motivation, what my reasons were for procrastination, and so on and so on - all things that have changed my approach so fundamentally that the genuinely urgent and important items "are" now working within AF without the need for some form of external "control" system.  <br><br>Learning to "trust the system" takes a lot more time than we realise and the temptation is to mix AF with other things to "make it work" but we are making it work in the way "we" decide is right which may not always be the best.  I am certainly not advocating throwing deadlines out and ignoring those urgent and important items, but I have certainly found that when those urgent and important items do not stand out, then there is a very specific reason, and it is that reason that needs to be identified and addresssed as much as "just doing" the task itself.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Christine that the reason behind important and urgent things not being done in AF needs to be identified - AF itself is certainly choosing less important stuff. I would also agree with her that it should be tried 'as is' with attempts to examine for any perceived deficiencies in the way you work it before giving it up or combining it with a different set of 'rules'.<br><br>One point I would make is that AF has a delay before there is a real pressure on getting 'avoided tasks' (which these urgent and important tasks seem to be) done. It is only towards the end when there is no smaller/easier stuff left on the page that there is pressure to address them. This does not address issues of urgency - but Mark has said that urgent items have to be done without reference to AF, though you need to consider why they are urgent. I still think that the main point is about why important stuff does not get it due activity and some self-reflection is probably needed on that and on the best way to address it; for some people that may be DIT, but it could be something like 'What is the biggest task on the page? I'll do a bit of it.' as the first thing you do on every page. AF is as much about working with yourself as it is about working with your tasks.<br><br>I don't completely abide by the 'rules'. I do use tags. I do think about what will I do today. I will do things as they seem appropriate without going back to the list all the time. But I am informed about what there is to do by AF and influenced by other priorities. I certainly prioritise doing things rather than thinking about doing things; and prioritise doing things to looking at the list. I will go back to the list after a period of 'doing' and proceed sytematically through the pages, crossing off the done things and doing things on pages that may not have had anything done on them, and then adding those things I realised needed doing earlier. I feel that, if AF is supposed to work intuitively, I need to make sure that my intuitition has lots of freedom to roam.<br><br>Where I think there is a weakness in AF, for some people at least, is the way that the sequence of things to do is governed by the sequence of closed lists and the probably fairly random process in which tasks are added to the list. If you are going to stick rigidly to the sequence, you probably need to think carefully about the process of adding items to the list.<br><br>I'd also note that granularity is an important issue here. If you enter lots of tiny tasks or subtasks separately you will have a different experience to entering a project title. If you work electronically, you can enter a title and add subtasks, and change subtask granularity as you go along completely within AF. If you operate a set of project files you can do the same on paper.</div>

<div class="content">Many time management specialists use the time quadrant approach to how you should manage your time.  "Important & urgent", "important and not urgent", "not important and urgent" and "not important, not urgent".  <br><br>I think it's unfortunate that a fairly powerful tool like AF, used in the wrong hands, can lead to busyness and focusing on "not important, not urgent" and "not important and urgent"  to the exclusion of probably the most important category of "important and not urgent".   I believe that if you put enough important "rocks" in your "AF jar" - or on a separate list if necessary to focus on the project, you will do the right things.  <br><br>I like your hybrid method Klaus, and I may move to that approach after I'm done this week of pure focus on year-end to the exclusion of everything else.</div>

<div class="content">Just to clarify things a bit, I was not thinking about abandoning AF or not using it as intended. The AF list is there and working for its purpose and in the intended way. I am just a little selective about what I write on it. Things I know I need to do the next day I will put straight on to that page in the task diary. This is usage of common sense as per instructions. The MIT's or Current initiative points in the same direction. I view them more as part of my project management which again per instructions are supposed to be kept outside of AF.<br><br>Still AF will serve as an aid to select all the other stuff and always gives me the security that everything that needs doing is on that list and can be dealt with.</div>

<div class="content">Whilst I agree that a lot of the time honoured time management tools, such as the Urgent and Important Quadrants etc have a great deal to recommend them, and certainly agree that there is a need to monitor time dependent tasks and deadlines outside of AF, as there is a need to monitor project progress, there is still the fact that AF does not work in that conventional way.<br><br>There seems to be the feeling that the "simple and easy" tasks get done first, leaving the harder tasks to the end on any given page.  Yes it is generally the high resistance tasks that get left but not exclusively.  If we are getting the "standing out" right, then the tasks that "stand out" will be a mixture BUT there will be a reason.  I actually think that the belief that the "easy" tasks are actioned first may just be a misperception - "because" AF has made them seem easy!  If I look at any page, completed or partially completed, then I would guarantee that there will be high resistance items completed as well as apparently easy items.  It is also a misperception that "easy" equals "unimportant".  AF has made "important" tasks feel easy.  <br><br>Obviously it is possible to go through the pages "choosing" items that just seem easy, but that is treating AF as a To Do list - or a series of To Do lists.  If you do the task that "stands out" that is where AF wins hands down over any other system I have ever used. The fact that I have used a system consistently for nearly three months now is an absolute first for me - if AF had only enabled me to deal with the unimportant stuff then I would have had to have given up because no-one can exist for long acting in that manner.<br><br>Other problems arise with AF if we start to grade items ourselves as "urgent", "important" or "ought to do" items, and base our "choosing" on that grading.  That is not in any way to say we do not need to ensure that "must do" items get done "on time" but there is always a danger of "our" interpretation being pushed onto AF and trying to turn it into a structured system - which for me anyway has never worked well.<br><br>As I have posted previously, I keep a separate list (in the form a MindMap) of items I consider urgent and important, or that I want to prioritise. I do not then treat that list as AF in anyway, but have no doubt that it influences my subconscious as to what stands out.  What that does do is allow those tasks to "stand out" and therefore become "easy". It doesn't change them to unimportant just because they are now easy and yes, there are some of those items that I do have to "just do" because life is like that.  What I do know though is that with AF I operate consistently at a much higher level of productivity than without, and I do mean productivity as opposed to busywork.</div>

<div class="content">It sounds like debbier above finds like I did on my home list - that she's focusing too much on minor things - yes, the important things WERE getting done, but the pace isn't fast enough.  There's a number of ways around it - and one is to do as she intends on doing - to have a current initiative.  Or you can do like I do now and increase the granularity of the unimportant tasks while putting loads of items on the list related to the important ones.  It all depends on the project whether you can do that or not.  I think you do this Christine, as you mentioned that you put in 70+ items on an important project recently?<br><br>I for one feel more like the easy tasks get left behind, and as evidenced by my dismissal of a whole bunch of them a week ago, what got dismissed was definitely all in the "unimportant, not urgent" category (like David C expressed above).  And what got kept and what I did was in the "important, not urgent" category - which is how it should be.   AF did the filtering for me.  This is why I get slightly disturbed when people haven't done much dismissal, it seems critical to me to dismiss to filter out the nonsense, without it, AF becomes too much like a to-do list.<br><br>Having said that, I don't personally experience a whole lot of resistance to difficult tasks and don't generally put things off (aside from my house reno - but I've conquered that beast :-) - but some people do.  Hopefully they will be able to find their own ways to focus on what's really important.  Some can do that within AF but some need the extra focus and structure on a regular basis for those things that will move them to their goals.  <br><br>Vive le difference - if we were all the same, this forum and life would be a boring place to be.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Yes you're right - I have put lots of items into AF in order to get some of my backlog projects out of the way once and for all.  It's not something i would have felt comfortable doing at the start of AF - and I know I need to control it - but AF is handling it and handling it well.  I do believe there are stages with AF where it continues to surprise you as to how it does handle things.  I have to adapt my usage to a degree to accomodate my mass input but feel comfortable doing that "because" I understand it better - although I am by no means convinced it hasn't got a lot more to teach me ....... :-)<br><br>I am frustrated to a degree in that some of the "fun things" that I put on my list have gotten to dismissal stage but they will go back at some point when I am more able to be, dare I say (Mike please don't shout at me!), more balanced ....<br><br>As you say though, vive la difference!</div>

<div class="content">Hi smileypete<br><br>That's exactly it - we do need to ask ourselves why they don't stand out - there is always a reason but not necessarily one we want to hear.<br><br>What I have found with AF is that when "important" items don't stand out I have a choice.  I either grit my teeth and do it - or I allow AF to show me the reason for the resistance.  I have actually found that AF is a "safe" environment to examine those reasons. I think that is because we are not forced to act on them - we still have a choice.  So, say I allow myself to look at the reason and identify the reason.  It is safe to look at that BECAUSE I still have a choice - I can choose to do the item, using whatever tools I wish (gritted teeth, structured list, whatever) or I can dismiss it, or I can act on my new found knowledge.  In practice I have acted on some things, and changed my approach - or taken the necessary action to avoid a recurrence of the relevant situation.  On others I have realised I am just not ready to face what needs to be done at this point in time.  That is OK too - AF provides the safety margin of a system that does not "forget" the tasks and allows the ability to "just do it".  However, by having the tasks recorded, even if only as part of a dismissed item review, there will come a point in time at which we will feel able to deal with the root issues and address the necessary areas.<br><br>AF allows the time and distance for us to take action in a considered way.  For example, say someone comes to realise by their resistance that they are actually in the wrong job.  they may decide that something needs to be done (ie change job) but the likelihood of them taking definitive action at the point of realisation is pretty unlikely.  I suspect if anyone had immediately resigned their job the instant they realised then they would have posted about it :-)<br><br>What is more likely is that they will accept that they need some form of structured approach to the "hated tasks" whilst at the same time planning their next move - do they change jobs, if so when, where, how etc.  Of course they may decide to stay where they are.  That is a choice and an informed decision - the likelihood is though that some form of structure will be necessary as the relevant tasks will probably maintain a high resistance level.</div>

<div class="content">Smileypete, I really believe vital items **should** stand out and kind of wave their hand at you to be done.  I think the only way they won't stand out at work is if you are in a very wrong job for you.  Obviously every job has some chores involved where we have to push ourselves, but that should be the exception, not the rule.   Overall, if you really have to push yourself to be doing the bulk of your job every day, you are not in the right job.<br><br>Even at home this holds true.  I cannot put reading on my list, it always calls to me.  Someone else could be trying to read more and would put that on their list and resist it.  In pushing myself to be at home more like I've learned to be at work, I really don't hate housework the way I used to anymore, and yes, sometimes it even feels ready to be done - both on and off the list.  <br><br>I also think we train ourselves into particular patterns of procrastination behaviour, creating some kind of neural pathway that gets stronger with repetition.  But if we train ourselves into procrastination, we can train ourselves out of it as well.  I've had jobs where I had to push myself into doing every little task.  I literally trained myself over the last 10 years or so not to be this way - by completely breaking down my resistance / aversion to almost anything (kind of like the movie Yes Man).   But having jobs that are right for me helps.  Having a family and social life that I enjoy where my needs get met too helps.  <br><br>Don't you believe that after say a year - or five - of breaking through your resistance to things, you will eventually feel like you can do anything - because you've put your mind to it and your experience tells you that you can?  <br><br>Say you have a project that's due in a week, and where you would have put it off until day 6 before (and worried about it the whole time), now you'll do it as soon as you can, so you can enjoy the next 6 days worry-free.  You know the outcome will ultimately be that you will do the project - so you can make it easy on yourself or hard.   <br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">The advantages of DIT *as set out in Marks one days work system* compared to AF are so great that as far as I am concerned it is no contest. But if AF works for you thats fine.<br>2. Good though it is DIT has two shortcomings. It is basically reactive and does not cope with backlogs very well.<br>3. Enter AF. I like to start the day with a clean slate. Each morning I draw up an ACTION THIS DAY list. This is borrowed from Sir Winston Churchill - google it to see an example of his sticker. This consists of yesterdays in tray, task diary entries and items from my BFfile. Tasks are grouped under three heads Mac, desk and telephone. Any tasks not completed at the end of the day are carried over to the next day. But only once. If they are still not done they are transferred to my AF list. I also use the AF list for someday tasks.<br>4. This is a flexible system which combines the best features of DIT and AF. It works for me and may do so for you too. Try it and see.<br>5.

In practice very few items are transferred to the AF list. I follow General MacArthurs TM system, viz have a plan, execute it violently, do it today.

<div class="content">What a great thread this has turned out to be, thanks to everyone who has contributed. I too had only recently discovered DIT at the end of 2008 and just started to implement it before Mark introduced AF, and whilst I love AF as my various posts attest, there was also a lot a loved about DIT (backlog/current initiative/someday tasks etc). I have been at AF in it's pure sense since it was released and found it to be very effective but this post has given me a pause for thought on some of those activities I had also found beneficial.

<div class="content">'Action this day'!<br><br>The way I'm interpreting this is like a more dynamic expression for 'current initiative' really. I've been finding that using AF strictly, I was occasionally getting paralysed into ditching the list at some point because I was worrying about not getting to a particularly important task. And often, by the time I did, I was so worked up about it that all the benefits of AF were lost.<br><br>Now I decide before I begin each day the one or two things I really want to move forward on that day, and I make sure I get a big chunk of them done first thing. After that it's all downhill - AF works perfectly once I got that initial stress out of my system, the rest of the big projects are easier to work on having got over the initial hurdle, and even if emergencies take over the rest if the day, at the end I can say 'well at least I did X'.</div>

<div class="content">Very helpful ideas from everyone here, thanks.  <br><br>Have we got a new system 'ATD' ? Thanks to David London for his simple and clear structure and the idea from Damien that AF and BFs are the buckets for collecting tasks past and future is so neat.  <br><br>One potential limitation of AF, it seems to me, stems from the time it takes a person to cycle through the pages. If it takes too long either due to little discretionary time, or type of tasks which take longer to get something meaningful done on them, then anything which is time sensitive has to be managed outside of AF.  This of course create a vicious circle of spending more time 'outside of AF' and taking even longer to cycle through the pages.  <br><br>Maybe there is a tipping point where, if the volume of your work which is time-structured occupies more than x% of your time, and if the number of tasks in AF and the time chunks needed to move them on exceed y, then you might need to work the list differently than the official method of working through one page at a time.  Those cleverer than me might be able to construct a formula or work out what x and y are, but I suspect they probably vary between people and jobs.  <br><br>I think I must be hovering around this tipping point for work (home AF is fine) because pulling out the 'big rocks' to ensure I focus on major tasks I must deliver soon is key for me.  And keeping up with yesterday's 'intray' and diary commitments too.  So pretty much as David London describes.  After that, if any time is left, the AF list can come into its own.  <br><br>I'm really hoping that Mark is working on that new hybrid which will help those of us with this problem, as AF is such a great tool.  I think the real challenge is knowing how and when to fit it in with the other tools.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jane<br><br>I understand what you mean when you say that "One potential limitation of AF, it seems to me, stems from the time it takes a person to cycle through the pages. If it takes too long either due to little discretionary time, or type of tasks which take longer to get something meaningful done on them, then anything which is time sensitive has to be managed outside of AF. This of course create a vicious circle of spending more time 'outside of AF' and taking even longer to cycle through the pages."   It is true that it is when you cannot cycle through the pages daily, whether due to discretionery time constraints, volume of tasks, or volume of genuinely urgent items that there is a real challenge.  However I still firmly believe that those things can be done within AF.<br><br>If you take things back to the simplest level, if something needs to be done it will be done.  We talk about discretionery time but what is discretionery time? It is merely time "we" have discretion over and that includes, to a greater extent than we may give credit to, some of the time for scheduled tasks. For example, certain times of my week are taken up by fixed appointments relating to my parents' care needs.  In those times I have no discretionery time, therefore cannot work on my AF lists in the normal way.  But neither can I action urgent tasks or anything else in that time so fretting over whether AF will "work" in that scenario is pointless.  Discretionery time is time where "I" have the control of using it, and that will inevitably include a large part of my scheduled time.  IIf I go to a gym class at a particular time it is scheduled so I am not working on my lists.  However, that is still time "I" have chosen to use that way and actually both those scenarios can easily fit into AF.  If I have a recurring item of "parents health needs" it is a simple job to tick that off when actioned.  Similarly "check schedule" or "action scheduled item" can just as easily be actioned within AF.  The fact is that those items are being done at times not necessarily of "my" choosing under AF rules (in that I am not setting the "when I feel like it and for as long as I like" parameters). Those areas of what is perceived to be non discretionery time are just part of normal everyday life and the life choices we make.<br><br>As for those "urgent" and "important" items..... Without going back over whether they are genuinely urgent and important, as there is plenty posted on that topic, AF has the common sense rule to handle such tasks.  What seems to be the main requirement is to have some "system" that will fit those tasks in, and there seems to be a real need to have a structure to enable action on those items at the "right" time.  <br><br>Assuming that the tasks in question are genuinely urgent, then it seems to me that they fall into two categories - those that are urgent and important that could have been actioned earlier and those that appear at short notice.  The former will most likely be accompanied by a fair degree of backlog.  Using AF according to the rules will enable backlogs to be cleared, and for future tasks of the same nature to be actioned on a timely basis, and therefore after a period of time AF will deal with such tasks with no problem.  In this scenario there will be a settling down period, the length of which will depend upon the extent of the problem and there will be a need to "find a solution", whether by scheduling or by using the common sense rule.<br><br>The second scenario requires a different approach.  In order for immediate urgent tasks to be actioned within AF they must be actioned by one of three methods, by being scheduled, using the common sense rule or by "standing out" from the current page.  Again, all of these options fall within AF so the wish to find a solution "outside of AF" must be for some other reason.<br><br>It seems to me that the real issue is not the doing of the tasks. If I am able to action tasks from within AF with over 50 active pages, over 600 active tasks and erratic discretionery time then to me that is evidence that the system is adaptable enough to cope with anything I choose to throw at it.  The issue therefore seems to be more related to the "standing out" of tasks and the fear or perception that "urgent" tasks will be missed.  I can honestly say that for me, the likelihood of urgent tasks being missed is practically zero.  My AF system ensures that will not happen - by keeping to the rules. <br><br>Are tasks "standing out" properly?  That is a little more difficult to define BECAUSE I have a backlog.  That is of necessity impacting upon the approach I am having to use but I have to say that even backlog tasks are being done on a basis which is a lot closer to "standing out" than a gritted teeth approach.  In other words resistance levels are minimal even if not completely eliminated. <br><br>I have adapted the way in which I work through the pages because with the number of pages I have I need a means of review, but I am able to feel in control by working within AF.  If I constantly had to to flit between AF, a MUST DO TODAY list, CARRY FORWARD, BROUGHT FORWARD, BIG ROCKS List, or anything else I would go bananas!  I TOTALLY understand the need for control and the desire to tinker with a system and to add bits to it, but it is the very simplicity of AF that gives me back control. Yes I have my scheuled and project management system, and my method of working through and reviewing the pages that gives me an overview, but AF genuinely manages the lot.  The hardest part is that fear of "letting go" and "trusting the system".  Once that is gotten out of the way, well, then you can really start to play ......... :-) <br></div>

<div class="content">It's interesting reading this thread that there seem to be two main complaints about AF: <br><br>1) That there's a tendency not to do the "important but not urgent" items.<br><br>2) That it can take too long to get to the urgent items.<br><br>Isn't there a basic contradiction here?<br><br>The reason it takes time to get to the urgent items is precisely because one is dealing with the "important but not urgent items" on earlier pages.<br><br>If an item is "important but not urgent" then the AF system ensures that you will eventually get to it. This is what counts - after all by definition the item is not urgent, but it *is* important that it gets done.<br><br>There is always the let-out rule that if an item gets so urgent that it has to be done now, then it should be done now. But for most people the majority of urgent items are only urgent because they have been left for too long.<br><br>Worked properly according to the rules, AF ensures that both the routine and non-routine items get done. My experience is that additions to the system only succeed in throwing it off balance. In other words my attempts to find a hybrid DIT/AF system did NOT succeed. So far, after reading all the discussions on this forum and elsewhere and trying out a lot of new ideas, I have not found anything which in my opinion improves on the original instructions.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Christine for your long and considered reply.  <br><br>Yes you are right that AF allows for common sense and scheduled time, so in that sense I am working 'within AF'.   What I am saying is that the common sense rule and demands of scheduled time take up 80% of my work time, and so AF list time (if following the instructions strictly about moving through the pages) might not get me to work on the next big thing quick enough.  So it feels like common sense to use a project list with due dates to ensure I work on the right thing next - to remind me what should be 'standing out', if you like.  And when days are especially busy with scheduled time or urgent work (as many are), a 'must do today' ('Action This Day') list is very helpful until there is space to get back to the AF list (which is my master list).  <br><br>It seems from others' posts that a few of us use AF alongside other techniques to help us manage our time - this is not an attack on AF (which is brilliant at doing what it says on the tin) but a desire to understand and share ideas for making best use of AF alongside other tools in a schedule-driven or project-driven or urgent-turn-round environment.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jane<br><br>The more structured our time is the more challenging it is to work with a freeform system but I think that the issues surrounding the scheduling of time come down to whether "we" have the freedom of scheduling or whether the scheduling is imposed from outside.  For example, if we work from home we probably have a lot more say over whether we can action home type task in "working" hours, whereas if we are in an office environment we would not be able to excuse ourselves from a meeting because we have a burning desire to "sort sock drawer".  I would imagine that in either environment we can choose to schedule time to work on a specific project, and perhaps use a project specific AF style list to progress that project.  However I think at the end of the day it comes down not just to scheduling but to proactive vs reactive time.  I think we would all like to work proactively but the fact is that in many cases we are forced to act reactively.  AF cannot operate easily in that scenario but what I think it can do is get us to "the best place" where we are better able to act effectively in a reactive environment.<br><br>For example, if I have 101 things clamouring for attention, and AF enables me to identify them, clarify my thinking about them, act effectively on them when time is available, and to put best systems in place to manage those and similar tasks going forward, then, when a crisis (reactive) situation arises, I will be better able to focus on it because my mind will not be filled with same levels of anxiety about my 101 "things".<br><br>Nevertheless, it is vital that genuinely urgent things get done, and, particularly in a quick turnaround environment some means of maitaining an overview of those tasks is necessary.  I do that myself with my MindMap of "urgent and important stuff" but by not treating it as a "must do today" list I quickly identify that some of those tasks are "want to" rather than "must do."   However, in different work environments the volume of genuine "must do" items will of course vary so it sounds as though your techniques are working really well for you alongside AF.  I think there will always be a need for other tools and techniques to work alongside AF (as opposed to within AF) and anything we can do to improve effectiveness in the areas that AF does not cover, such as scheduled or immediate reactive time, then the easier life will be:-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark, interestingly enough, I have found that I don't need to use either approach (increasing discretionary time or decreasing tasks) even though I have little of the former and a lot of the latter. The AF system solves the problem for me. Every time I have found myself feeling panicky or overwhelmed, I look over more than 20 pages of tasks and find that there are very few tasks that really MUST be done. Those that must be completed are very doable. The rest honestly could be dismissed and never done or done well into the future. I am so happy that I don't have to endure the mental anguish of determining what has to go. It just gets decided by default. In fact, when I was using GTD, the same thing was happening. I was doing the MUST DO's and the big WANT TO's and most of the rest just sat on lists that never got reviewed. The difference with GTD was that I had a lot of anxiety and self-recrimination because of those effectively "dismissed" tasks. With AF, I don't.<br><br>Of course I'm not saying there's never an occasion for re-evaluating your commitments. There is!

There are definitely occasions when I have to do more tasks "because" they must be done than I would like, but even those tasks are done more easily.  Being totally objective about it, my discretionery time has not changed (which is not enough) and my tasks have not changed (which are too many) but with AF, my ability to action those tasks has improved and therefore my rate of productivity is higher.  The fact that, for the first time in years, I am not only on top of current stuff but also clearing my backlogs, must by default mean that I will reach a point without backlog, and be able to move forward so much more effectively that I will no doubt find that my discretionery time will actually be more than enough.<br><br>I guess if you look at it another way, we are doing what Mark suggested (increasing discretionery time and/or reducing tasks) but not in an arbitrary or "rational" sense but rather allowing AF to do it intuitively.     <br></div>

<div class="content">Christine, I was thinking about your large list and realized that if you use the approach of adding tasks that need to be done frequently to nearly every page, OF COURSE you have a lot of pages! One of the reasons I have a large list is because of the number of repeating tasks I have to do with a large family and home. Most tasks are re-added to the list. I'm so thankful for AF because at least I can have the accomplishment of closing out a page even though I will be doing most of these tasks over and over for the next 18 years at least. lol</div>

It's strange but none of the systems that recommend listing simple items that you can cross off and chalk up a "win" ever worked well for me as they just felt like cheating.  AF never feels like that.  I actually put very few routine tasks into my lists now; I still have coffee and email at the start of each page and do add in routines if I feel I am getting behind, but otherwise they just seem to get done.  I cleared another major part of my backlog this last week and still cannot quite believe how much I am getting done.

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Welcome to AF!  The novelty doesn't wear off!  I'd recommend just doing a quick review of all of your lists on a regular basis, perhaps at the end of the day.  That gives you a good overview and keeps items that are urgent in mind, but also allows AF to sift them in the background.  After a few weeks you will probably find that you become so familiar with the lists that a review takes almost no time at all.  Having used AF since January, I know my lists pretty well and can review them in just a minute or so, even though I have a lot of pages.<br><br>If you are concerned about AF not handling your lesson planning, why not put it into AF as well as into your schedule - you may well find that the schedule becomes redundant for that task .....<br><br>Best of luck!</div>

<div class="content">Instead of entering tasks in one long list why not enter them in your task diary.<br>Thus the task diary for a given day would be made up of previously scheduled tasks, tasks from your bring forward file and yesterdays in-tray. Plus any today urgent tasks. Each day would represent a closed list rather than a page of an AF list.

<div class="content">Hm. I do like the idea of having each page of the AF list be from one day. I do AF electronically and I name my pages alphabetically. What would happen if instead every page was based on tasks that came to mind or were re-added for that date? In other words, the number of items would vary but you could treat the pages the same way you treat them according to the AF rules. The problem with DIT is that you don't have as effective an approach for dealing with undone tasks as you do with AF. So why not use the same strategy? In this case, you could use your task diary as your AF list if you're a paper person. I'm going to give this approach a try. One concern is the number of pages will likely go up. I know some others have commented on this in the past. Does it work?</div>

Right now the AF list is nothing more than the AF list ... just a simple list.  It is clean.  It has no priority or scheduling associated with it.  Once I put it into my calendar I'll have more distraction ... I think.  Putting it in the calendar adds a kind of implicit scheduling dimension.  At least that is how I would probably see it.  For me it also might be problematic as I use a page-a- week format book.  So I'd have only one new page per week to list items ... a maximum of about 40 items or so -- I could maybe double that by drawing a vertical line down the page.  I'd have to manage my chunk size so as not to exceed that number or I'd be gluing in extra pages and ... OY!  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike, that's a definite downside, in terms of number of items. Even those who use a page a day could have trouble if they have more items than they can list in a day. I see what you're saying about the psychology of "scheduling" and being behind, but I think if you think of it as just an AF list that you do NOT have to clear and in all likelihood won't clear a la DIT, I think it might be doable. I think you're right about clearing pages faster. I like that. I just set up my software to use this approach from today on. I'm not going to change the rest of my electronic pages in case this turns out to be a bad idea. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mel<br><br>For me using a page a day would give very erratic results.  Like my discretionery time, the number of items entered varies, some days none, some days 2 or 3, the most in any one day being 141.  I REALLY would not want pages like that!!<br><br>I am already VERY frustrated with page 7 - it had a lot of old items and so each visit I would only do one or two - every time I leave that page I think "next time I will be able to dismiss", but EVERY TIME something stands out!!  Page 7 is sitting in splendid isolation, in the midst of a whole host of closed pages but I can't put that magic circle round the cross any further forward than page 6!!!  Imagine if that page had 141 items ..... :-(  <br><br>There are only 3 left now ...........:-)<br><br>Besides, my notebook looks so neat (despite my writing) with page after page of tasks, most ticked off, several highlighted, and the only visible notation being the date on the first item each day.  I just lurve my notebook! ......</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I knew he was referring to the real strength of DIT by suggesting a task diary for AF. The perfectionist in me longs for DIT to be effective in my life. In fact, I think it could have worked had I really understand "little and often" and continuing to add projects to the next day's list. The way it doesn't work for me, however, is in having to limit what I work on. With DIT, it isn't feasible to say "Oh gee, wouldn't this be interesting" every hour and expect to follow up on them all the next day. I was really thinking of true AF, only structuring pages based on days. This is very similar to how I currently work in that I usually fill up a page a day, but there's overlap. I like the notion of being able to say that I have pages open since X date. Because I don't use paper, I don't have dated pages the way you do which permits this very information without using a page a day approach. A page a day also is less work for me electronically. I don't have to pay attention to the number of tasks and make a new page during the day. I can start a new page each day and add away. As usual, I am just interested in experimenting and seeing the results. I may very well return to OAF (original AutoFocus - lol).<br><br>Christine, obviously this approach would not work for you, especially using paper. In a way, though, I am wondering if the variability of having different length pages would be a bonus for me. I like pages with many items sometimes and sometimes I like to see only a few. If it doesn't work, no harm done.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>I have always been conscious of Mark's early comments about the fact that a reasonable number of items ensures that one has the option for several passes of each page before dismissal becomes necessary.  Too few items would remove that level of review, and too many items could leave pages languishing for a very long time.  I can see though that the digital solutions you have been looking at could well react very differently.  As my digital solution works so well I would not consider changing but it seems that Andreas' web based option or the changeable page size Excel approach could give you more options to experiment with.  Have you tried either of those?<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine, that IS cause for concern and if it ends up being an issue, I will quickly resume OAF (Original AF). I understand exactly what you mean about not wanting to change a system you like. I have given Andreas' website a shot and it DOES work with IPhone which is a requirement for me, but I really want to be able to enter a due date and have it sorted that way for one. For another, I like noting the few errands I have on my list so I can select those out if desired, too. I do love that you can re-add with one button. Maybe Andreas will take my ideas into consideration? I'm such a novice with Excel and it's really not IPhone friendly. Right now I just love Listomni. It has to be one of the finest apps I've used to date in general--beautiful UI and no bugs! It's going to take several weeks (I'm thinking at least 3) to really see whether a page a day will work for me. I'll be sure to report. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>I have to say that if OneNote was more mobile friendly I may well get into using that type of application.  I really have never found the due date an issue with AF - I just seem to know when my due dates are and have been able to get things done before deadlines a lot more easily.  Not necessarily resistance free as yet but certainly at a lower level of resistance - and I am quite anxious to see what happens once my major backlog is out of the way.  I reckon about another 3 months should see the end of it ......</div>
