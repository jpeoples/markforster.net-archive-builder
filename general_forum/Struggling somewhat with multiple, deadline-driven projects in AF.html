<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>I have had a reasonably good run with AF since I began Beta-testing.  There are many things I like about the system.  I like being able to choose what I am going to be doing now -- tasks that stand out for me -- amongst a long list of possibilities.  I like the structure of closed, active pages except the last one.  I like being able to enter everything in the system so simply.  However, I am struggling somewhat with deadline-driven projects.  <br><br>I have multiple projects I oversee -- from major research grants and teams of people working on them under my guidance as PI -- to many administrative projects -- to multiple manuscripts, reviews, book chapters, lectures to design and prepare, etc.  I am not having a problem with the ones that are not so deadline-driven.  Much of my research is not in that category, and I am finding that AF works well for these muliple projects and tasks.  The main problem I am still encountering has to do with multiple deadlines in projects and one-off tasks.  I do use a project management software package and I do enter deadlines in my Outlook 2007 calendar.  But when I add these many, many tasks in my AF system -- along with everything else -- I do not get a sense of freedom, but more of a bit of panic that I am going to miss something.  Plus, if I am scanning page 5 and I know there are tasks on page 7 that are important and due soon -- not urgently today -- but soon -- within a week or so -- then I find my mind wandering to those as I am scanning tasks on page 5.  A task usually stands out on page 5 -- and it is important, but is not deadline-driven.  I readily acknowledge its importance.  To be true to the system -- and needing to get to page 7 where the deadline-driven tasks are -- I feel I need to work on the important task quickly and not too long because I need to get to that deadline-driven task.  <br><br>I know this is just a mental game I am playing with myself, but I am still searching for a better way to handle these very large, important, and deadline-driven tasks amongst a sea of hundreds of other tasks on my AF lists.<br><br>Advice, anyone?<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I've been struggling with that, too, and trying Mark's idea of having an extra, movable sheet that lists my current tasks with a near deadline.  Then, when looking at my current AF page, I also look through my movable Urgent page.  And then choose whichever task stands out from the two pages.  <br><br>It's not quite flowing the way the base AF system flows, and there's something about it that doesn't quite feel right.  But I'm still trying to make it work.<br><br>I've also tried blocking out time on my calendar for items that have near deadlines, to make sure I give them at least some attention.  But I find that I resist getting started on those tasks, when my Outlook reminder pops up and tells me it's time to work on those things.  I just put it off for a few minutes, then a few minutes more, and pretty soon that block of time has expired and I still haven't done anything on that important task.<br><br>So, sorry to say, I don't have any great solution, and am still struggling with the solutions that have been proposed.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>I don't know that I have a complete answer for you because my circumstances are very different from yours, but I have found two answers which seem to correspond to what your concerns are. <br><br>The first is "Trust the system". Whenever I get panicky about not getting to something in time, I find the solution is just to trust that it's on the list and I'll get to it. It's never let me down yet. There's always the safety net of "if it needs doing now, do it now" - but I usually only have to bring that into play for short-term "same day or less" items.<br><br>The second is that sometimes it's easier to deal with a major project if it's in the list as one entry, and sometimes if it's broken down into smaller tasks. You might want to experiment with this.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and Seraphim,<br><br>The knowledge that these deadline-driven tasks are on the list to date have not made me feel less stressed.  Perhaps it is just me.  I am going to experiment with this.  What I am doing now is putting tasks that have hard due dates directly in Outlook 2007 in the To-Do Bar and also in the calendar.  But what this does is create two lists -- my large AF list that has all of my tasks and projects that are not deadline driven -- and a separate list for my deadline-driven tasks.  Hmmm....while it might not be the best for the AF protocol overall, maybe this is a reasonable way to do this.  One can look at the deadline list first and choose to work on whatever stands out....and for however long one feels comfortable...and then switch over to the AF list....and go back and forth.  Or if there are really tight deadlines, one could choose to work an entire moring, afternoon, or full day just off of the deadline list...and get to the AF list as soon as is possible.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I think Mark's advice about trusting the system is absolutely vital but it is really hard when that moment of panic hits.  I suspect that you and I both started this system from a position of backlog, for the simple reason that our previous systems weren't working.  We probably both met our deadlines, even if just by the skin of our teeth, but never comfortably.  This is something I have been giving a fair amount of thought to today, because although I want to trust the system - and it most certainly has not let me down, there are still those voices of panic saying "but what if you don't make the deadline......?"<br><br>I did another (lengthy as usual) post on this today which you've probably already seen.<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/637923" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/637923</a><br>My gut feeling is that we will find that, for maybe the first few months, there will be those deadlines that need some extraordinary action, perhaps outside of AF.  However I really think that those issues will gradually die out.<br><br>I have a deadline on a major project by the end of this month which I knew from the beginning was not achievable.  I had come up with a partial solution but did not know how to action it and then today I received a letter impacting that which threw me into a total panic, because the deadline seemed to have been arbitrarily moved back without my knowledge to last year with resultant penalties!  The curious thing, when I ceased my panic, was that (despite the remaining concerns) I became aware that my subconscious must have been working on this in the background, because suddenly an alternative option just snapped into place which could enable that deadline actually to be met. It was genuinely impossible to meet the deadline (the agreed deadline!) according to the method I had been working but there is an alternative which I would not have considered previously.<br> <br>OK I still have to sort out the deadline "change" but hope to get that resolved tomorrow - as an urgent same day task.<br><br>David, I think there is a lot more going on behind the scenes so to speak from a subconscious point of view and I think we do need to "trust the system", not from a point of blind faith but because so far all the evidence is that it can be trusted.  If the amount of "common sense-just do it" items are more than we wish to start with then so be it - the proof of the pudding I think will probably not be totally evident for a few more months.<br> <br><br></div>

<div class="content">How about adding a line to each page that says 'Quick scan of all active pages for deadline / urgent tasks'...<br><br>Dave</div>

<div class="content">I definitely recommend keeping your list of milestones/deadlines separate from AF - you need to be able to quickly see when things are due and AF isn't there for that. But I think it is a good idea to not look at this all the time (ie switching) because there's a lot of power working from one list. <br><br>I try to make some time each week (a weekly review) to look through my deadlines for the upcoming week. Because I prefer the portability of paper, I write these down on a piece of paper (ordered by date due) and if there's a number of them, I will block out time that needs to be worked on them in my diary/calendar. Then each morning, I will look through what has shown up on my calendar/reminder system for the day (this can be tickler items, appointments, blocked out times, deadlines). Previously this would go on a to-do list for the day but now I add these to the Urgent/Time context items on the index card bookmark amendment from Mark ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/629549" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/629549</a> ). Because the index card bookmark is effectively on the same page as AF, it works as one system, rather than having to go back and forth from two systems. It also means I can have a lot of complexity in the back end but the AF system that I actually work from is blissfully simple.<br><br>I know there's been a lot of talk on these forums about electronic ways to manage AF but I find paper works the best for AF and I am the biggest gadget/widget addict around. I can take my notebook everywhere and just jot down something when I think of it without starting up my computer. I can have it next to me on my desk and keep my computer screen focused on what I'm supposed to be doing. I still use my digital tools - I use Google Calendar to track my hard landscape to use a GTD term, ie appointments, events and strict deadlines (eg an essay due date) and I use Remember the Milk (.com) to track my project lists and project deadlines (eg when I would like to have my draft essay written), as well as tickler and reminder items. Remember the Milk is a bit like a master list, it has all my someday items as well but it's very good at creating filters to let you know what's due for the week. As I've said on another thread, AF isn't about managing, it's about doing. It's all very well knowing what must get done this week and what is important to get done, but it doesn't mean things will get done. The simpler you can make your AF system, the more likely you're going to work from it.</div>

<div class="content">David<br><br>I'm almost completely deadline-driven and can sympathise with your problem. As a result, my diary carries equal importance as my AF list, and is consulted nearly as much.<br><br>The diary I use is a page-a-day version, with an area to list time-dependent stuff plus a plain vanilla list space. Time-dependent tasks - appointments, calls to return, etc, obviously go in the former spot. On the plain list I put tasks that have to be done today, sometime; and most importantly, the projects that I need to maintain a focus on during the day.<br><br>It then becomes a simple matter to scan the "must do" project list, which jogs memory about any outstanding tasks related to these projects hat can be then tracked down on the AF list. I find it surprisingly easy to find these tasks because my brain seems to spatially recall where they are.</div>

<div class="content">Oh I forgot to say that all items that I'm tracking in my calendar with clear milestones should also be in AF so that I start working on them before they become due and need to be put on the index card! <br><br>I also don't get stressed out about whether I've added that item before to AF, if I think about it I'll often enter it again into AF and definitely if I'm not sure. I don't waste time flicking through the pages to check. If it's on multiple pages then I'm going to get to it more times.  I see it as my subconscious saying "this is important - do more work on it!". If I get to a page and it's already done, it's no trouble at all (in fact it's a lovely feeling) just to cross it out. I try not to edit when putting things in the system, that's a job I can do when I am working through the system.<br><br>When I deal with urgent or time scheduled items, even if they are already in AF, they will get repeated on the index card. I won't bother going through AF to cross out things that I've done on the index card but will cross them out when I get to them in the system. That way I get a nice motivation boost when I'm working a page and sometimes it can act as a reminder that there are other steps on that project or follow up to do.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, everyone, for posting very helpful advice.  It all comes down to becoming comfortable with a new system I guess.<br><br>-David</div>
