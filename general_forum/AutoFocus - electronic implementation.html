<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-5 10:41</div>
<div class="content">I've been thinking about an electronic implemention of AutoFocus for the last few hours now. My requirements would be for both a desktop PC-based and PDA-based implementation (currently Blackberry).<br><br>If your todo list software allows it, it might well be possible to implement the system by sorting your Master Task List by task creation date and setting up tasks to recur immediately on completion when you create them (if you have such an automatic feature). This would ensure that completed tasks (which are really just tasks you are pausing for now) immediately show up on the bottom of the list again. To FINALLY complete a task, you would need to delete it from the Master Task List so that it cannot automatically recur.<br><br>Also, you would need to ensure completed tasks are displayed to maintain the spacing between tasks.<br><br>In order to hold your current position in the Master Task List while you enter new tasks, you can create a new "Inbox" task list which you transfer into the Master Task List when you reach the end of your active tasks. Because tasks are sorted in creation date order, it should not matter that these Inbox tasks were entered into another list...they should merge into the Master Task List in the correct sequence.<br><br>The first major problem I have with my current software in implementing this approach is that the position I currently am in the Master Task List is not preserved when I re-enter the list. In other words, every time I re-open the Master Task List, my software places the cursor back at the top of the list. So, unless I place a marker (say, an asterisk) in the task title before I leave the list, I won't remember where I was. I cannot see this being workable because it is too easy to forget to bookmark your last location before leaving the list.<br><br>But the major show-stopping problem with this type of approach is how to segment pages of 25-35 tasks. And further, how to carry this segmentation of tasks onto a PDA. This is the point at which I gave up because things were getting too complex.<br><br>As an alternative, I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that the simplest workable solution is just a paginated word processing document of 25-35 lines, operated in exactly the same way as Mark's paper-based approach. This would ensure that the segmentation of tasks is preserved both on the desktop and the PDA. <br><br>On the desktop, you just use Microsoft Word (or your favourite alternative) and then sync to, for example, DataViz's DocumentsToGo (or your favourite alternative). I will be trying this out today.<br><br>I envisage using the "strikethrough" feature of the word processing fonts to mimick crossing-off an item on the list, and the background colour highlighting feature to mimick using a highlighter pen.<br><br>One could create a new word processing document at regular intervals (say, every few days or even daily) to permit old completed/rejected task lists to be archived.<br><br>Hope that helps someone.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Frank, that's very helpful. My feeling was that a wordprocessor document divided into segments was probably the best answer too. But I haven't tried it myself, being a paper and pen man!<br></div>

<div class="content">I'm trying this electronically and came to the same conclusion that pages in a document were the most friendly way of doing this, though I've gone for sheets in Excel rather than Word.  I've set up a multi-sheet spreadsheet with 25 numbered items per sheet and I've customised the toolbar to allow strikethrough and highlight as one-click items.</div>

<div class="content">One extra tip that I'm finding very useful as I enter my (vast!) task list into this system is to have two instances of Word open simultaneously both pointing at the same AutoFocus document (will work for Excel too).<br><br>Ensure that synchronized-scrolling between the documents is NOT turned on and then have one visible document pointing at your current active tasks page and the other pointing at the end of the AutoFocus document. (This is using Microsoft Word 2007 - I haven't checked if you can do this in the same way in earlier versions)<br><br>If you view both these documents side-by-side (each showing a full page) on a widescreen monitor, it means you can work on your current active page and enter new tasks into the same document without having to keep scrolling your AutoFocus document every time you think of something new to add.<br><br>In case you're wondering, the Microsoft Word split feature on a single document doesn't work well here because you are having to give up part of the "one page at a time" view for the split portion - hence side-by-side is better. (However, if you have a wide-screen monitor rotated into portrait mode, you might be able to use the split view successfully if you reduce your font size.)<br><br>Hope that makes sense. This little tip is saving me a lot of time at the moment!</div>

<div class="content">I'm thinking of trying this in Outlook, and have an idea that might help address the issue of losing your place in the list.  Outlook allows you to have multiple folders of tasks.  Only the *main* Tasks folder can popup reminders for you, but AFTM doesn't rely on reminders...  So I'll try creating multiple folders to represent "Pages".  <br><br>Once the view within any given "Page" requires scrolling, I'll create a new folder (e.g. "Page 02") and start posting new items there.  When a "page" is fully completed it can be dragged into an 'Archive' folder.  When a "page" is reviewed without any standout items, it can be temporarily dragged into an 'Inactive' folder.<br><br>Once I've finished one session of working on an item, I like your auto-recur suggestion.  The new items would simply get drag/dropped to the newest "page" folder if the current folder is full.</div>

<div class="content">Kevin,<br><br>Funnily enough, I've just finished implementing almost exactly that - the same thought occurred to me about "pages" of tasks instead of trying to use one long Master Task List. I've just finished implementing it in a Blackberry tasks application called ToDoMatrix.<br><br>I was just going to use an Active folder and an Archive folder but I like your "Inactive" folder amendment so I am going to steal it. <grin><br><br>The Microsoft Word approach has been working fine for me most of the day but I found it cumbersome when I moved over to my PDA. If I was always desktop-based, it would have been quite okay to continue with. So I started looking again at a tasks application approach...and obviously came up with the same one as you've just suggested!</div>

<div class="content">If you're looking for a good tool to use, check out Jarte ( <a href="http://www.jarte.com/download.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jarte.com/download.html</a> ). It's a very flexible, simple word processor. The page size is good for AutoFocus, it has strikeout, highlighting, tabs, etc. It can be set to minimize as an icon to the notification area at the bottom right of your screen. To me, it's ideal: it's very uncomplicated and easy to use.</div>

<div class="content">I've only just started testing this system (I have a great experience with... procrastination...) but was thinking about an electronic implementation as well. It just so happens that I own a piece of software called ListPro, which as the name implies is a program for making/maintaining lists. Once I'm happy with my AF implementation in ListPro lists, I'll post some screenshots (added to my list, of course).<br><br>I'll definitely be checking out the OneNote implementations explained in the forum as well, though, I use it for all kinds of purposes. The main advantage with ListPro is that it's dedicated to lists and opens instantly, whereas on my computer OneNote is a bit of a slow starter (add "Buy more RAM" to list ;) ).<br><br>ListPro (shareware) can be found here: <a href="http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/lp/listpro.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/lp/listpro.php</a><br><br>btw, I'm not affiliated with the developers of ListPro in any way.</div>

<div class="content">I have given this some thought as I use pocket informant and I'm sure I could tinker with it to use this system - it would also be useful as it will add in tasks scheduled for particular days or with deadlines - but before I do i'll operate it paperbased to see how it works for me.  I don't want to bog myself down trying to implement this electronically until I know it is a system for me.<br><br>On reflection I have windows journal on my work lap top which would enable highlighting and crossing out, that might be a way foraward for work tasks, but it wouldn't have the functionality of pocket informant</div>

<div class="content">Unless you are interested in how AF could be implemented in Excel, or some other spreadsheet application, you can ignore this post.<br><br>Replying to Anne Bennett who wrote: "I'm trying this electronically and came to the same conclusion that pages in a document were the most friendly way of doing this, though I've gone for sheets in Excel rather than Word. I've set up a multi-sheet spreadsheet with 25 numbered items per sheet and I've customised the toolbar to allow strikethrough and highlight as one-click items."<br><br>This weekend I tried using AF at home. Saturday morning I bought a new notebook, with 34 lines, but I decided to follow Rod's advice and keep my list on Jarte. It works OK, but it got me thinking.<br><br>For now, I will bring the paper notebook to work and use that for the next week. But if I were to go electronic, I would start with Excel. I can see some enormous benefits to keeping an Excel list up all day long at work and at home, when I am there.<br><br>I like the immediacy of paper. But digital has other advantages: it's much neater than my handwriting, it's rapidly searchable, it can be filtered, it enhances project tracking.<br><br>How to implement Excel depends entirely on the column headings. I am thinking something along the following:<br><br>1. Complete<br>2. Dismissed<br>3. Item Name<br>4. Assignee<br>5. Recurrence Date<br>6. Project<br>7. Context<br><br>Here's how I would envision it. I fill up a page or two with items, in column 3. At work, I have about 15 daily recurrent tasks. For those, I would enter the description in column 3 and the "date due" in column 5. This way, after I complete the recurring task, I will rewrite it at the end of the list but with a new recurrence date.<br><br>When an item is completed, I put a character ("x" or "1", e.g.) in column 1. If a page is dismissed, I put a character in BOTH column 1 AND column 2. Note, I do not use strikeout or highlight, to represent completed or dismissed tasks. Essentially, I am creating a database, so I want to represent the state of a task by an entry in another field, not by its format.<br><br>I set up my spreadsheet with the top row--the one that has the column names--frozen. When I start work in the morning, I go to the top row, column 1, and hit "End" and "Down Arrow" on my (PC) keyboard. This takes me to the first uncompleted, undismissed task. Excel shows a line for page breaks, so I proceed to work my way in standard AF fashion through the pages.<br><br>What would be non-standard are columns 4 and 6. Column 4 is Assignee. In my job, I have a lot of things that I might need to delegate or discuss with others. For GTDers, this would correspond with the "Agenda" context. Using Excel, I could filter out all uncompleted tasks that have "Bob" in this column. This would allow me to batch items, so when I walk over to  Bob's desk to talk about customs documents I can also talk to him about the burglar alarm problem and the vacation schedule issues that occur at different places in my list. I also use this when I ask  Bob to do something and I want to follow up with him to get a progress report.<br><br>Column 6 is project. I am less confident that this will prove useful. If there is one thing that GTD helped me with, it was that I like have a master list with all my projects in it. If I ever get comfortable enough with AF, and decide that such a master list is superfluous, I will abandon it. But I am not there yet. I view this column as a step in the direction of abandoning my GTD project list. I like having documentation of what I have already done on a project and where I think it's headed.<br><br>Column 7 is another optional column. When I did GTD, I only used 3 contexts--Work, Home, Errands. I actually am not knowledgeable about how to use thumb drives. But, I am thinking that it might help to keep the spreadsheet on a thumb drive, or synchronize it with a spreadsheet on my Blackberry. This way, when I am at work, I can filter it for Work and when I am home, I can filter it for Home. Of course, I can always remove this column, and just keep one spreadsheet going at work and one at home. But I often get Home ideas at Work and vice versa. So it would be nice to have consolidated database/spreadsheet.<br><br>As I said, I am not going to even start this implementation until after I do another workweek of AF using paper, as Mark recommends. But this is how I am imagining it could be done in Excel. How's it going for Anne and others who have already tried it in Excel?</div>

<div class="content">What is the best software will very much depend on individual needs and familiarity.<br><br>Nevertheless, I'm a bit surprised at the number of people who want to load a huge application like Excel or Word. I assume it's because they tend to be open anyway in which case it makes sense, but otherwise it seems like taking a sledgehammer to a tiny berry.<br><br>ListPro is an excellent and responsive program, which works well on PC and PPC, but can't be used from a USB; so it depends if you need that.<br><br>For people who want to use a Word Processor type document approach, I would suggest an Outlining-type Notes program. They are are founded on a database rather than multiple documents; there are many controls on toolbars (or not if you prefer) and they tend to be quicker and easier to use than WP programs. There are many of them and individual preferences will decide which is best; I mostly use TreeDBNotes (which has a perfectly good free version). You have the choice of having separate pages on different notes (all showing in the outliner pane) or on different trees (all showing in different tabs) or as different sections on a single page (sections separated by a single click horizontal line). TreeDB works on USBs but not PPCs etc, though easy to export a document that can be read/edited on a PPC. Multiple options for export, so your data is never tied in. If using USB versions, you can have more than one instance at a time if you have each in a separate folder - this enables the option of having home and work databases open at the same time. Single button press to enter time and date.  Would suit people who want a lot of visual options in the lists. I never write anything in Word any more. And I generally open Word documents in other WPs because they are much quicker.<br><br>In another thread, I suggested AbstractSpoon's ToDoList2 for someone who wanted to have a timer for each task. It is easy to set up separate tasklists for each page and multiple options both for input, management, viewing and searching. At the same time it can be cut down to look very simple and entry can be very quick if you just enter in the title and Ctrl-N for a new item. Allows timed/dated/recurrent tasks to be put on the same list as everything else. Easy to have sub-tasks and dependencies if you want. Can import from Outlook, there's a variety of export options so can be read/edited on a PPC and can be run from a USB.<br><br>In both approaches it is easy to copy and paste to the end 'page' (cutting and pasting multiple documents is made much easier using a clipboard manager such as Clipmate, Ditto etc).Also easy to store links to documents/emails/webpages in both types of prog or all the relevant data.<br><br>I'd have to say that most todolist progs and PIMs are just not set up to run the AF approach. Too much time consumed by the entry forms and too much effort in the organisation and no ways of setting up pages without really kludging.<br><br>After lots of consideration of alternatives, I started using an outliner/notes prog then decided to switch to TDL2 because I thought it would be easier to keep track of dated/today items in that rather than have a separate system. Exporting and importing the info took approx 2 minutes.<br><br>I did consider OneNote/Evernote/UltraRecall (all of which I have) but thought they were all too big for the purpose and I don't need their specialised abilities for this.</div>

<div class="content">I've used electronic tools in the past, but having used an A4 pad and a calendar for AF for a week I'd really encourage everyone to try it...portable, simple, accessible. I do not see the value from trying to do this electronically, each to their own I guess, and will be interested to see the results.</div>

<div class="content">I have been giving AF a try since its launch, although I am used to an electronic system (home-grown, but based on GTD).<br><br>One thing that I have found much harder is locating a given item in my lists.  Maybe it's just my bad memory, but I'll think, "Ooh, I must do X - or have I already entered that on the list?", and I then need to pore through all my multiple pages of lists to see if I already entered it.  One beauty of many electronic systems is that they let you search your tasks for given entries, keywords, contexts, etc., which is slow to do on paper.</div>

<div class="content">I have set up Autofocus in Excel on my laptop to try & replicate exactly Mark's paper-based system & am so far finding it a great way to work.  I have deliberately avoided trying to make it more complicated or 'techy' than Mark's instructions, so my list is in Excel worksheets, 30 lines to a list, & I create a new worksheet as soon as I've filled up the 30 lines.<br><br>The sheets are called Sheet 1, Sheet 2 etc - i.e. just like sheets in a notebook.  When I've worked on something for as long as feels right, I copy it to the end of the final sheet if it's still incomplete, then strike it out in its first position & put today's date in the column alongside the struck-out task.  Highlighting rejected items will be easy, & when a whole sheet ends up on the reject pile then I plan to colour the tab accordingly.<br><br>In other words, it's merely treating Excel as a 30-lines-per-page notebook.  The advantages to me are that I type faster (& more legibly) than I handwrite, & work at most other things from my laptop anyway.<br><br>I'm finding the whole system splendid for breaking down resistance.  I got off to a good start today because I didn't have to spend any time writing a list (it was already there), & I knew I'd be able to find something on my first page I didn't mind doing, even first thing on a Monday!</div>

<div class="content">Richard:<br><br>I don't personally worry about whether I've entered an item before. I just put it down when I think of it. If it transpires it's down twice, so what? I just delete the second one when I become aware of it.</div>

<div class="content">I don't have any headings in my worksheets - they are just two columns - a number and the task itself.  Each sheet has the basic instructions for how to use the system on the right hand side just for convenience.  I strike through anything I've done and highlight anything I've dismissed.  The sheets are called Page 1, Page 2....and if a sheet has everything crossed off I move it to an archive workbook, just because I don't want to have to scroll through lots of sheets.  I'd like to delete it completely, but a record of what I have done is handy for appraisals etc.<br>]<br>In other words I am using Excel as an electronic notebook and nothing more, but it's working very well for me.  The system seems to cope with all sorts of different types of tasks, working well with my very 'mixed up' working life where I switch from creative writing to interviewing to speaking to housework and back again.</div>

<div class="content">In response to Carol asking about using Pocket Informant for an AF implementation.....I've just started using this software to implement AF2. I've created a Task template with the first part of the subject being a Smart Macro that automatically inserts the date and then the time. As I can't sort on Creation Date, I sort a plain list of Tasks by Subject. Having the task subject start with the Date and Time sorts all the tasks with the newest at the bottom.<br>I also include all Completed Tasks).<br><br>HTH<br><br>Richard<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Richard,<br><br>Very clever: I've been wondering how to do that on my smartphone.<br><br>I switched to paper when AF2 came out, partly because, whilst AF1 worked beautifully with outlook tasks, I struggled to get the tasks in order on the smartphone. I ended up using start date, which worked well with minimal overhead for AF1 but doesn't really work for AF2.<br><br>I assume you use a category to mark the "on notice" items?<br><br>The other big advantage of an electronic solution is the ability to filter out the completed and dismissed tasks, and to list just the dismissed tasks for review.</div>

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>Yes, I'v got a separate 'AF2 possible dismissal' category which highlights the text in red. If they then end up getting dismissed I change the category to grey them out but put an icon next to them so I know which ones were actually dismissed. Sounds complicated but it runs quickly once setup. <br><br>The only other step I take is to delete all completed tasks above the task(s) highlighted for dismissal. Otherwise I spend far too long scrolling up and down in case I've missed a task. It keeps my lists current and manageable.<br></div>
