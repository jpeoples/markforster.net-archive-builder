<div class="content">Hey Guys<br><br>I am a 2nd year university student and have a really advanced math exam coming up in 20 days. However, I detest math to the extreme and have an extremely strong and deep seated resistance to starting my prep for the test. I know what steps to take and have even set milestones but am simply unable to start. As a newbie, what system should I implement in this situation.</div>

<div class="content">3T and timeboxing. <br><br>3T pick 3 tasks. Work on each one sequentially. When two are done, select 2 more<br><br>Timeboxing: For each task set a timer for 5 minutes. Do not work past 5 minutes on each of the 3 tasks. The next round, for any task not done, do 10 minutes, then 15, etc. <br><br>You can find both the official rules and tips for 3T and timeboxing on the site. I created an excel sheet with macros that help me track the time increments. I can send if interested.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for answering. Please post your sheet as I would really like to take a look at it. Although I've tried a strategy similar to yours of using small timeboxes and incrementally raising the time. It seems to backfire as it keeps breaking my momentum and makes me even more disinclined towards my linear algebra book. I don't have an issue with studying regulalrly, my resistance is only towards math.</div>

<div class="content">Jane,<br>If the 5-min timer is a non-starter, a similar strategy is to name a small task rather than a small time increment.<br><br>"Get the book out" is the classic small task. If that is too small to get you motivated, try expanding it until it feels just barely worth doing, e.g. "Read page one of the review sheet."</div>

<div class="content">For me the best system for eliminating resistance to even the most resistance-prone tasks is the Randomizer-with-sliding method:<br><a href="../blog/Random Time Management.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html</a><br><br>It is uncanny how resistance just disappears.</div>

<div class="content">I agree  with Seraphim about the randomizr method.<br><br>Another method that can work well is a Panic List for the one subject of math.</div>

<div class="content">Bribe yourself with rewards. They don't need to be big but they need to be something you want. Then keep your  eyes  on the rewards during the pauses so you'll notice the net resistance is smaller. <br>'When X started then reward 1', 'When Y done then reward 2' and so on. <br>This has been a good way to avoid cleaning the house when I have had a high resistance task to do. <br>And make sure the other tasks are such that they give you a feeling of success when done.</div>

<div class="content">Is there a classmate you can study with? When I was in grad school, groups of us would get together when a paper deadline was near and then retreat to different corners of the apartment to write for half an hour or so and then compare how many words we wrote. With writing sometimes, looking forward to having it done provided the motivation,<br><br>Doing the studying with a partner -- making it a social commitment -- can make slogging through something you hate easier than flaying yourself to do it. <br><br>And this will sound horrible advice but: wait till the last minute. When it's urgent and the heat is on, that may provide the external motivation you're seeking.<br><br>The thought occurs to me: how do you do other things in life you don't want to do? Your taxes? Cleaning the toilet? Vacuuming? How do you get yourself to do those things? Can you adapt that mindset to this problem? Right now all you can see is "I hate Math" and you're trying to find a way around that thought. But that thought is just a thought -- it feels real because you're pushing so much emotion behind it, but it's not a Thing the way my cup of coffee is a Thing. How can you view this situation as just a situation that has to be managed? How would YOU advise a friend facing the same situation? Would you advise them to suffer through it?<br><br>Sorry if I'm blathering and all over the place with this post -- just top of the morning, first coffee of the day thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">Rewards combined with the Random method have worked brilliantly. I managed to get around 25% of my total work done in about 13 hours of studying interspaced with breaks. A big thanks to all those who answered.</div>

<div class="content">It sounds like resistance is more of a problem than knowing what to do when. Here are some things that I have found helpful:<br><br>Self-compassion: Sit with your feelings about math and the test. It's probably a minefield. Many studies have shown that compassion for yourself help us to do better. It's a tricky balance. Compassion is not pitty. It's not saying woe is me, it's just sitting with someone who is in pain. It can make the rest of your studying much more effective.<br><br>Depending on what comes up when you sit with your discomfort, this might be a long-term approach.<br><br>Self care. If the studying isn't going to happen, use that time for something else.<br><br>S.T.R.E.S.S analysis: <a href="../general_forum/Procrastination, Laziness -- S.T.R.E.S.S..html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2674568</a><br>This method is used by the local ADHD and Asperger's Center, and I think it applies for everyone. It helps break down what's behind the resistance. Sometimes you discover something easy to deal with, sometimes something that's more complex.<br><br>Plan Z. Forget plans B and C, what is plan Z? This is also known as catastrophizing. What is the worst that will happen if you fail the test? Will you be kicked out of school? Will your entire future be ruined? Check with your undergrad advisor. Many schools have counselors who know the options for each program. It's like shining a flashlight in the darkness. Once we know what's there, we know what to prepare for, and usually we discover it's not as bad as we feared, and there are often concrete things we can do about it.<br><br>May you be well. May you be safe. May you be peaceful and at ease.</div>

<div class="content">I tried the random time management system a few years ago, but it didn't stick.  I was having trouble with the basic definition of a "task" being either an action or a project as defined by GTD, that I just couldn't really get to the algorithm part.  But now that I'm over the task definition hurdle, I think I'd like to give this a try.  I'm noticed some resistance creeping into my simple scanning over the past week.  Some tasks I'm having a hard time moving on that I usually found time for in the past.<br><br>I have a good digital list going right now.  Has there been any discussion on how to use radomizing with scanning with one long list with no pages?  I like the idea of a physical die to use for randomization, just for fun. I found a 120-sided die online that looks intriguing.  Is this suitable for my list with 210 lines of uncrossed and crossed-off tasks?</div>

They allow you to clear out older pages more quickly. This mechanism puts a bias on older tasks. This is important to the dynamics of the system. Even though the tasks are selected randomly, it really feels like you are making strong progress, and resistance drops to zero.<br><br>I tried doing something similar on a pageless electronic system. <br><br>First, I needed to make sure there was a way to keep completed tasks on the page (crossed out or visible in some way). Many task apps allow you to do this. If your app doesn't, then maybe you can replace the task with an empty task or a "-" mark or something.<br><br>Second, you need some kind of mechanism to stay on a "page". I simply set up my screen to show a constant number of tasks (say, 20) on the screen. <br><br>That worked pretty well but was kind of annoying if I accidentally scrolled down the page or something.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps you are right Christopher.  <br><br>One thing I haven't done much of is scheduling appointments with myself for things that I want to do daily.  For example, I would like to exercise, practice piano, and compose music daily.  I put them on my list to see if I would get to them more than I used to with scheduling.  I think I am getting to them less.  I think I need to do some scheduling to help me with it.<br><br>Is there any good posts out there or books that Mark has written that describe good practices for scheduling items versus keeping them on your long list?</div>

<div class="content">Cameron:<br><br>AFAIK, Mark has always held scheduling as a perfectly valid way of doing things. His latest books covers the importance of such routines more exhaustingly.<br><br>Routines, like practising your instrument as a certain time, can be prompted by the long list. If you work through the long list fast enough, your practising routine should "stand out" naturally at the right time.<br><br>Daily routines and the long list, it takes some time to get into the groove ;-), but it is perfectly doable. I had trouble with this too, but it does work.<br><br>What I think the underlying thing is, with scheduling you already committed to the time in writing, with the long list this is not so obvious. You kinda have to remind yourself when you wanted to play.<br><br>But ultimately the long list prepares you better, internally to do the things when you really want to do them.</div>
