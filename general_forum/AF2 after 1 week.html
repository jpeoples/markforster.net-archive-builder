<div class="content">I switched over to AF2 last Monday... thought I would share my thoughts on it after one week.<br><br>I did just continue with my AF1 list (sorry, Mark!) - it was pretty short.  I don't perceive that doing so has caused any significant problems with the running of AF2.<br><br>I sometimes find myself missing the closed list aspect of AF1 ... occasionally I do fall back on old habits and work on several items from one page before going back to the "beginning" of the list.  In general, though, I find that I'm not having any problem picking tasks starting from the end of the list and I think this habit will become ingrained pretty quickly.<br><br>Rather than middle-of-the-list bloat, I am experiencing uneven closing of pages - right now, listing from the end forward, I have 2 active pages, three closed pages, and then another 2 active pages.  (There are relatively few items on those 2 pages, though - the first page has 3 items, one of which is on notice for today, and the second has six items, one of which I suspect will end up being dismissed.)  This may be a function of having started with a mature AF1 list, though - we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.<br><br>As for dismissal, I like the AF2 method MUCH better.  Looking back, with AF1 I felt like things could be dismissed with no warning.  Yes, they had been looked at and passed up many times, but I like the notification that my subconscious gets to pay attention to the thing(s) above the dismissal line for the day.  So far I have only ended up dismissing one item out of five that have been put on notice (I did not work my AF list in any real way over the holiday weekend, as we had houseguests).<br><br>With the transition I have also been working on the habit of putting "Internets" on the list to try to curb my magpie-like web-browsing.  It's kind of scary to see how often 2 "Internets" entries appear in the list in a row.  :^)  But it's working so far!<br><br>Thanks again, Mark, for all your work in developing these systems and for being so generous with your time and ideas here on the forum and on the mailing list!</div>
