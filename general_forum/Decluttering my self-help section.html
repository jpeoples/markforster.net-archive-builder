<div class="content">I am (or was - I've toned it down since AF) a voracious reader and built up an extensive collection of self-help books over the years in trying to solve my procrastination tendencies.  Thanks to AF, I finally feel ready to let a lot of these books go.<br>Bye bye to "Your Own Worst Enemy - Breaking the Habit of Adult Under-Achievement", Maximum Achievement", David Allen's "Ready for Anything", Tony Robbins ... and lots of others.<br><br>One book that I really like though is Overcoming Procrastination by Albert Ellis.  He has a very good chapter in there on behavioral methods to combat procrastination.  He also has a good discussion in there on how people talk to themselves because of their procrastination.  I'm still giving the book away though.  <br><br>I feel kind of sad though, in looking for so many years at all the *why's*, I realize I have wasted so much time because I just didn't have the right *how*.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Ooooh, I liked that Ellis book too; thanks for reminding me.  I just found it on the shelf and re-read Chapter 8 on Behavioral Methods.  My favorite AF-theme quote:  "... better to do a worthwhile task part way then to avoid it completely."<br><br>I've also donated most of my self-help books to the local library.</div>

<div class="content">Hi slothbear, it's already gone, so I can't refer to it, but in a quick read through before I sent it off to a new home today, I realized his explanations (low frustration tolerance, musturbation - love that term! etc.) and methods (little and often) work so very well with AF.  The structure for how to implement wasn't there though, so I didn't stick to the methods.  It's a great book to read in conjunction with practicing AF, that's for certain.</div>

<div class="content">Isaiah Berlin wrote about the hedgehog and the fox. The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. <br><br>Mark Forster's a fox. He keeps creating new systems and writing new books about them. David Allen is a hedgehog. He wrote the same book three times, but gave it three different titles.<br><br>Albert Ellis probably wrote 150 books. Just read one and you've pretty much read the other 149. But it was a VERY good book. <br><br>I view AF as a very Ellisian (?) method. He might not have mentioned it in _Overcoming Procrastination_ but it fits right in with his methodology.</div>

<div class="content">A good essay by Bill Knaus - coauthor of Overcoming Procrastination - title is "Beat Procrastination Now!":<br><br><a href="http://www.rebtnetwork.org/essays/pro1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rebtnetwork.org/essays/pro1.html</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">The _Now Habit_ by Fiore is worth its price for the "unschedule" idea. You can probably find the concept by googling around.<br><br>David Reynold's writing on "Constructive Living" especially the _Handbook_ is excellent.<br><br>The Unschedule, Reynold's ideas on doing, and the AF are my anti-procrastination or effective procrastination trifecta.</div>

<div class="content">Norman U, thanks for the reference to David K. Reynolds - I like this quote by Morita Shoma:<br><br>"My way of doing things is simple. It's not necessary to make impossible efforts when troubled. Put simply, when you are vexed just be vexed and say, 'Yes, and what shall I do?' Just be in suspense about the outcome and move forward a little at a time."<br><br>The Unschedule concept didn't work for me before, but I have a feeling that in conjunction with AF, it could work for me now.<br><br></div>
