<div class="content">There are several names for the new system floating around. Mark, how should we refer to the different systems from now on? I find the term "Revised Autofocus" strange if there is a newer Autofocus  system around. Initially you wanted to drop the R of RAF and call it just Autofocus, but it seems the development process is not at an end quite yet. :-)<br><br>Before we arrive at EMRAF (Even More Revised Autofocus), I'd propose returning to simple numbering calling RAF AF3 from now on and the new system AF4. Easy to remember, consistent and open for new AF family members.<br><br>Of course, RAF is so established by now that no one will adopt a new name by now. It was just an idea. ^_^<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I tend to find that a name naturally emerges as a result of the testing process, so I haven't yet decided what to call it.<br><br>I'm hoping (again) that the new version will be so good that it won't be necessary to keep the other versions extant. I think this time I may have succeeded in that.</div>

<div class="content">Fair enough. But I don't think it's possible to kill the older systems off completely, especially AF1 and RAF. Everyone has different preferences. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Of course the various versions of AF won't suddenly disappear into thin air so that anyone who tries to use them finds they don't work any longer!<br><br>I really just meant that the Autofocus System tab will only refer to the one version.</div>

<div class="content">"anyone who tries to use them finds they don't work any longer!"<br><br>It seems to me that many of the contributors on the forum have been around almost since the original AF Beta.  As discussed in another post, it was easy to be exited about and to explain to friends and coworkers.  AF2 and RAF are harder to explain and even hard to understand for people who didn't start with AF1.<br><br>Your comment seems to indicate you see a progression of learning (about ourselves and about our lists) beginning with AF1.<br><br>Whether you meant to or not, I think you have hit on a good point.  Going through this learning process might really be what is needed.</div>

<div class="content">Marty:<br><br>I'm hoping that the latest version will be as easy to explain (or perhaps even easier) than AF1. Yesterday I explained it to my younger daughter, whose tolerance of long explanations from her father is rather limited, and she seemed to get the idea immediately!</div>

<div class="content">We could call it UAF - Ultimate Autofocus.<br><br>It's not even a problem if there come another one after it. To quote rule 191 of "The Grand List Of Console Role Playing Game Clichés": Anything called "Ultima (whatever)" or "Ultimate (whatever)" isn't. There's always at least one thing somewhere in the world which is even more. <br><br>...<br><br>Okay, I *really* need to go to bed now. Reaching for the power button ...</div>
