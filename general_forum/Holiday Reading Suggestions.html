<div class="content">It is summer. Holiday time, excellent for reading some interesting book about productivity, life management etc. For inspiration, new ideas, realizing of what is important...<br><br>I suggest these two books:<br><br>Shapiro: Goal-free living (very interesting book which is not about having no goals, but how to approach them, what attitude to have and what type of goals are counterproductive)<br><br>Meier: Getting results the agile way (I know the book was discussed here several months ago, still I think it brings many excellent ideas, e.g. I liked the productivity pitfalls (<a href="http://gettingresults.com/wiki/Chapter_10_-_Results_Frame,_Personas,_and_Pitfalls)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://gettingresults.com/wiki/Chapter_10_-_Results_Frame,_Personas,_and_Pitfalls)</a> and many more chapters.<br><br>These two books are the best I have read recently and I recommend them for you. What would you recommend? I will (and I bet many forum users will) appreciate your tips.<br><br>Enjoy your summer!</div>

<div class="content">The Chimp Paradox by Dr Steve Peters - great insights into why we think and behave as we do and how to alter things for the better.<br><br>Currently re-reading Mark's Get Everything Done - still the book that I turn to when I need a bit of guidance and clarity.</div>

<div class="content">"The Power of Habits".  Fascinating book by two psychologists.  It reads like Malcolm Gladwell's books, with interesting stories related to key ideas.  But the ideas are so compelling.  In essence the book demonstrates how certain small habit changes (not any habit, just certain kinds) can lead to a total transformation of an individual's or company's outlook.  It's not prescriptive, but it is inspiring.</div>
