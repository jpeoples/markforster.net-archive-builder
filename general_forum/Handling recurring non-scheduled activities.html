<div class="content">Last night I wanted to read before turning out the light before going to sleep, and SF wouldn't let me.  The task was on a non-active page.<br><br>This seems to be a problem for anything that you want to do each day, but not at a scheduled time, so it's not on the calendar:  how to have the task available to stand out when you want to on the active page?<br><br>It happens that I cycle through my list extremely slowly compared with many people here, but as far as I can see, the same problem should exist regardless of speed.<br><br>I can think of various ways of dealing with this:<br><br>·	sprinkle the list with numerous instances of the task to increase the chances of it being there<br>·	have longer pages ( in my electronic implementation I'm using 20-line pages; I'm happy with that length - I hate scanning long lists)<br>·	create a Column 3 for recurring tasks (reminiscent of AF4 (Revised), which had separate pages for Unfinished and Recurring tasks)<br>·	define something like 'Read a newspaper', 'Listen to an MP3 download' , 'do some housework'  as a permanent unfinished task, to go into Col 2 (but there are very many recurring tasks that I want to handle daily; and I want to keep Col 2 lean)<br>·	schedule these things<br>·	- or attach them to an existing habit (reading is part of the going-to-bed routine; doing some housework is part of the lunchtime break ...)<br>·	remove head from bottom and use common sense (not at all sure about this; like others here, I want the system to handle this - I go off-list often enough)<br><br>Others'  thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">"SF wouldn't let me." No, SF always lets you. Just decide reading is urgent and do it. <br><br>"attach them to an existing habit (reading is part of the going-to-bed routine; doing some housework is part of the lunchtime break ...)"<br><br>I Do this and keep checklists for these items.</div>

<div class="content">Some of us (including Mark) use Outlook Reminders for this kind of thing.  I have a recurring reminder to feed the dogs.  It pops up in Outlook ~ 5PM.  I write it in Column 2.   It gets actioned within the next hour or two.<br><br>You can also use alarm clocks, cell phone reminders, etc., coupled (or not) with a list of recurring things, as Alan suggests.</div>

<div class="content">It all seemed a lot simpler in the cold light of two days later. I've set an alarm (thanks Seraphim) to start me on the getting-to-bed sequence (a full 1 hr 20m), with a list of activities (thanks Alan) attached to the alert (clearing the kitchen, setting up the computer for work first thing in the morning, etc.) with reading as the last item.</div>
