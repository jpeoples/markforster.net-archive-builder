<div class="content">Let's forget that Wiseman is either lying, or suprisingly ignorant, re: as-if condition<br><br><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/as-if-personality" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/as-if-personality</a><br><br>It's a bizarre world when behaviorists encourage people to act in ways that cause other people (borderline personality disorder, associated with as-if personality disorder) so much grief and suffering. <br><br>Woody Allen's Zelig is a humorous take on the as-if personality.</div>

<div class="content">That article reminds me of what they now call, IIRC, psychopathy. Some people just don't feel empathy. They can fake normal well -- on psych tests they appear unusually well-adjusted -- but when it comes right down to it, they don't care if others are comfortable. Some of the literature is scary. They're often very intelligent, and can mimic empathy very well.<br><br>As for a way to change my own behaviour, any trick that helps me build (and maintain, and rebuild) habits is welcome. If acting like someone who doesn't procrastinate gets the work done, I'll take it. That's not lying to others, nor is it lying to myself. All it is is asking myself what my best self would do, and doing it rather than ignoring it.<br><br>I can see it being a problem if I believe "I'll work on it every day this week -- all is going well," when experience shows I need to actually get work done before saying all is going well. That's nothing new, though -- when I'm in a rut, I'll say that to allow me to relax a bit longer.</div>

<div class="content">@avrum I think there is a misunderstanding here. "As if" personality is a psychiatric disorder. Behaving "as if" you were happier, more confident, more loving may improve your self-image. Here is a funny illustration of what I meant (and what I think Prof Wiseman intended) <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNKf7_ZJC0&feature=related" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNKf7_ZJC0&feature=related</a></div>

<div class="content">@michael<br><br>I come from a school of psychotherapy that believes a good life is one where individuals get clear on their principles/values, and do their best to allow these ideals to inform their daily actions.<br><br>But that's not my main beef. Wiseman is claiming (on video) that he created something called "as if". Either he's lying, or he's ignorant. Either way, his take on "as if" is a milder, less pathological version of what I described above. <br><br>Finally, I'm willing to wager that most of the changes he's championing are merely cosmetic, and won't last beyond a few weeks. In general, most behavioural i..e mindfulness, cbt, etc., have a very, very short shelf-life for most individuals.</div>
