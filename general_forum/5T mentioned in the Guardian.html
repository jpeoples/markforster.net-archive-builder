<div class="content">DAZ:<br><br>I haven't seen that. It's the second time the magazine has mentioned 5T. There was a short article by Oliver Burkeman in November, but he emailed me beforehand to tell me it was coming.<br><br>That article is available on-line, but I can't find the new one.<br><br>Is there any way you can scan/copy/clip the article and send it to me?</div>

<div class="content">Is it this one?<br><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/26/overwhelmed-10-ways-feel-less-busy" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/26/overwhelmed-10-ways-feel-less-busy</a><br><br>The second to last paragraph reads <br><br>"Try the five-item to-do list<br><br>One major problem with your endlessly expanding to-do list is that it fuels the fantasy of one day getting it all finished; adding one more item to the list feels effortless, so it’s dangerously easy to overcommit. The productivity coach Mark Forster proposes a radical alternative: instead of an open-ended list, use one capped at just five items, so you’re forced to complete (or consciously abandon) a task before adding another. The obvious objection to this is the risk that you’ll forget something important if you’re not allowed to write it down. But let’s be honest: you already forget important things anyway."</div>
