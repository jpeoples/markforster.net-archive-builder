<div class="content">Productivity is measured by quantity against capacity.<br>Effectivity is measured by value against effort.<br><br>The paradox is that you can be very productive without being effective at all!</div>

<div class="content">That quote reminds me of a scale for deciding what to work on. Tasks or activities are rated two ways, easy to hard to do and high to low in value. It seems that working on easy tasks with high value would be effective and productive.</div>

<div class="content">There's a system there: Sticky all your tasks on a large grid. Focus on the lower right corner and work diagonally up-left.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, <br>Grid? I can't picture that. Sometimes I write 2/8 on the sticky note, 2 equals easy and 8 equals high value.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not recommending this.  Just throwing out the concept:  Take a large section of wall (even a whiteboard) and draw a grid with 10 big squares across and 10 down.  Put your 2/8 sticky on the second bottom row, and the 8th column.  Start working on the 1easy and 10highvalue.</div>

<div class="content">Alan -<br><br>I think you're basically headed in 80/20 (Pareto) territory. Do things that have the greatest impact on results first. Those limited few are all that really matters.</div>

<div class="content">It seems to me that AF and SF do a great job of allowing your combined reason and intuition to find the optimal path between all these opposing forces, optimizing both productivity and effectivity.</div>
