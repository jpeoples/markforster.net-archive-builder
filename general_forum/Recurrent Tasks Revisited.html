<div class="content">I can't help but smile at the fact that almost none of the remaining active posters on this forum are doing AF4. So, I will drive my stake into the ground and let everyone know that I still think that AF4 is the best AF yet. Just the week, I hit a very slow period at work, which meant that I could really clear up a lot of outstanding tasks. But there have been many prior weeks of sheer hecticness, and AF4 kept me going through them as well. <br><br>But, I have one proviso. I have found no version of AF to be satisfactory for a small set of recurrent tasks that I have. Note, that I am not saying all recurrent tasks. Just some recurrent tasks. <br><br>Now, I know, technically, AF always has the escape clause that if you have to do something, just do it. But I am just GTD-anal-systematic enough that I don't want to have to start each day telling myself to stop doing AF while I do some must-do task. I'd rather get these puppies into my system.<br><br>I could put this small set of recurrent tasks on my calendar. But I don't like that. There are some tasks I like to do as soon as I arrive at my office in the morning. But sometimes I arrive and there are already urgent issues facing me, so I put off my recurrent tasks until a more appropriate time. I like the restricted flexibility of knowing that I will do them early in the day but not at a specified time.<br><br>I have always read Mark's advice that AF could handle these tasks. But, for me, it never could. I would put the recurrent tasks in my AF list, but would always end up doing them out of sequence (using the must-do escape clause).<br><br>So, I have 4 lists.<br>1. AF4. This is what I work from more than 95% of the time.<br>2. Calendar. For day-specific and time-specific reminders.<br>3. Daily Recurrent List. I want to make sure I brush my teeth some time after eating lunch. I don't want this on my calendar, since my lunchtime varies. So this goes on my recurrent list. There are some other housekeeping things I need to do daily at work that I also put here. I glance at this list on and off throughout the day. I do most of these things by habit. The list is more of a checklist, to make sure I didn't forget anything. Other daily habits that are less time-sensitive are on my AF4 list.<br>4. Someday/Maybe-Project List. This list has wild ideas that I am not committed to doing. I also use this list as a repository for my more complex projects that I feel I must plan, coordinate and track. Typically, I will review this list only once a week. If I happen to be working on one of the long-term, complex projects included in this list, I will then go to this list and update the project plan.<br><br>I spend almost my entire time in AF4. I have very few appointments, so my calendar is rarely used, though I do put in a number of day-specific reminders. I use my someday/maybe-project list for probably less than 5 minutes per week. The key to making AF4 work for me, was to go back to a DIT-style recurrent list. Not having it stressed me out in every version of AF. <br><br>So, yes, I do think AF4 is the best AF yet. But, of course, one could argue that I don't actually do AF4. My response would be that I do AF4 for the overwhelming majority of my day.</div>

<div class="content">I'd argue that no one does "pure" anything, when it comes to time management tools.  I think it is even the case that most people change the mix of tools they use over time ... to meet current needs.</div>

<div class="content">Hi moises, <br><br>From what you wrote above, I would absolutely say that you are doing AF4 and it sounds like it's working great!<br><br>FWIW, I plan on going back to AF1 when I cut back to very part-time work / semi-retirement in January.  I still wouldn't do it the way that Mark does - for the whole 16 waking hours in a day, but for 6 or 7 hours per day definitely.<br><br>A couple of days ago, I wrote out my list of everything that I wanted to get done for Xmas, and am working on it in an AF way.  I have just two pages of tasks, one page being optional things I'd like to get done and one page being necessary things that need to get done.<br><br>Like Mark, without the external accountability that comes with a job (or my job mentality anyway) or Mel's external accountability that comes with the needs of her family, if I don't have something to keep me on track, I can just drift through a day or week and not get much of anything accomplished when I don't have external accountability.  AF1 provides that level of accountability that I really like.  I just abandoned it temporarily due to the desire to finish major work projects that took up a lot - pretty much all - of my free time.<br><br>Maybe I'd even try AF4 again, but likely not because I don't generally have a "shiny new thing" tendency.  If something works, I stick with it.  Knowing that I'd have the time to close out a page every day or two with AF1 once I was up and running is a great motivator, whereas with AF4, it seems it would take longer to close out the closed list. <br><br>Re. daily reminders -<br>Years ago, when I used to use a Franklin Planner, I had one of those 2 inch cards they put out that went in a plastic sleeve and acted as the bookmark for your current page for recurrent daily reminders.  It worked great because you could check things off with a dry-erase marker.  Once I'm home, a dry erase board up on the fridge will serve the same function, I'm guessing.</div>

<div class="content">I'm now on Day 2 of AF1 and still loving it. In fact I had so many tasks crossed off my list this morning that I had to remind myself that it was less than 24 hours since I'd begun using it.<br><br>I haven't found it necessary to use it yet, but I think the best solution to the problem of urgent tasks or the ones in Moise's Daily Recurrent List is the "bookmark" list which allows those tasks to be treated as part of the current page.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe have a list at the end of the notebook, then write 'R' for recurrent next to the current task when things are sufficiently quiet.<br><br>I write a mnemonic at the top of the page, each letter stands for a daily task, then strike out each letter as it's task is done.<br><br>My current one is OFCS, which stands for Orange juice, Floss, Cod liver oil (yum!!!) and Shower (but not necessarily in that order - or together!)</div>

<div class="content">I'm still using AF4 and loving it.  The only thing I've cut down on is reading this forum, and that's because AF4 is working so well.  (And getting better as I adhere more closely to the rules.)<br><br>As for recurrent tasks there are a few I do every morning so I've written them on a post-it note that's stuck to my monitor.  And for those that come up at other times of the day, or weekly, monthly, or quarterly, I use Backpack (backpackit.com) which sends reminders to my phone &/or email.<br><br>I just wanted to chime in so that anyone new to the forum would know that there is at least one person that would fully endorse using AF4 by the book.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>First of all, thank you so much for your excellent books and systems!  I read and loved DIT a couple of months ago and that naturally led me here, where I've been lurking for a while.  Something you posted above has finally nudged me into commenting.  <br><br>Could you (or anyone) elaborate a bit on this statement: "I think the best solution to the problem... is the 'bookmark' list which allows those tasks to be treated as part of the current page."  I searched the forums and cannot find a description of this technique.  I'm probably over-thinking it, but how does that work exactly?</div>
