<div class="content">Ha - part of my inspiration to design my latest journal/project pages was based on this video. However the chicken-scratch, loose-leaf thing would drive my design sensibility coo coo. But I agree, some good ideas in that video.</div>

<div class="content">Some nice ideas.<br><br>The record of "what I actually did" is nice, both for "When did I last clean the fish tank" and for goals like "4 productive hours today".<br><br>I also like the focus for the day. The other projects aren't there to distract you, and, depending on how you build the list, you have confidence that, for today at least, you don't need to think about anything not on the list.<br><br>I have a problem with only seeing one task at a time. I might schedule something less urgent in the middle and something urgent at the end (predict no energy after first task, want to keep it moving even though isn't urgent, can't start final project of day until after meeting.) Life happens and I'm behind. Normally, I'd chop the middle thing. Much as I wanted to do it in the middle, the current best choice  is the final line -- yet with his method I don't see it.<br><br>It also doesn't take advantage of unexpected energy changes. If one task goes better than expected, I might be ready to tackle something nasty and should take advantage of it. Or the opposite, if something goes badly I might need a break. I'd rather be able to do something else useful than "next on list or nothing".<br><br>On the other hand, doing the next thing on the list is good discipline, which is something I need.<br><br>So, not something I'll try as written, but I'm not surprised it works for some people.</div>

<div class="content">I didn't take it to mean that covering the list and doing it in order was necessary.  It seemed to me that he did that only if the list looked overwhelming.</div>

<div class="content">It doesn't seem much different from my approach. Differences:<br>I use OneNote.<br>I use FV to run the day.<br>I have a running list to select the day's tasks from. He didn't show a method.<br>I only keep record of a day's activities, not hourly.<br>I don't write the day's summary.<br>I'm not persistent at it for 4 years;  Only for 3 months and not consistently.</div>

<div class="content">I like the idea of tracking what you did in the previous hour.<br><br>An idea I picked up from David Seah, but haven't implemented enough, is setting an alarm for a certain time and when it goes off checking you are actually doing the task you started off doing. He has developed several products around <a href="http://davidseah.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://davidseah.com/</a></div>
