<div class="content">I have done a few weeks of using Autofocus version 4 revised (new/old, recurring, unfinished). I'm satisfied with it. I even enjoy getting into my office, opening the notepad and 'playing what shall we do today'! I find the list of recurring tasks is a great way to do little maintenance jobs through the day, and the bigger things I move off into my calendar with a regular schedule. The unfinished task list can get a bit unwieldy, and so I'm wondering whether splitting it with a line and working it as a closed and an open list would help get stuff finished.<br><br>Then I discovered FVP. I'm new to these systems, so I'm re-evaluating. I think the question/algorithm is a great way to select tasks. I wonder whether anyone has used it on AF4R (would that work?), or whether the point is that it deals with the recurring and unfinished tasks well enough that they don't need to be separated out. However, I rather like the separation of these tasks, as it means I work on different types of things as I circulate the lists.<br><br>One thing that struck me about FVP is its use of pairwise comparisons to make better choices from many options. It is somewhat similar to the Condorcet method of electing a single politician from among many candidates by pairing each possible combination and asking the electorate which of the two they prefer each time. The winner is not the one with the most votes, but the one who wins the most pairwise comparisons. That is, the winner is not the picking of one from many, but picking one that is preferred more often than any other.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method<br><br>Musing aside, I'd appreciate advice from those who've tested both systems about which might be more productive. I prefer a catch-all system.</div>

<div class="content">Both AF4R and FVP have proven successful to many people.  I think you understand correctly that FVP works by comparing two things at a time.  <br><br>But AF4R is not the opposite of Condorcet; it is not "picking of one from many".  It is a stand-out method, as all autofocus systems are.  You simply look down the list and pick the first that stands out.  This picking of course doesn't preclude picking more things from that same list.  So in the end, AF systems don't even compare 2 tasks to each other, but rather each task to your state of mind.<br><br>Which is better in the short term or long run?  I think it depends on you.  If you choose to pursue one or the other, bring up any thoughts you have and we can comment.  I'm running my own variant similar to AF4R, which I won't recommend at this moment.  If you pursue FVP, there are lots of people who can talk about that.</div>
