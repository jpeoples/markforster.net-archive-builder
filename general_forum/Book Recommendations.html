<div class="content">Somehow I never ran across this page before:<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/recommended-books/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/recommended-books/</a><br><br>Wow, what a lot of great recommendations! And I've never even heard of most of these! I was wondering what to choose for my next Audible book, and now I have too many choices! :)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for finding this Seraphim. I've never seen it either, and I too have not heard of most of them.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I'd forgotten all about this page.<br><br>Not being part of the blog it doesn't have a date on it, but I think it would have been one of the earliest pages on the website. Therefore written about 2008.<br><br>The book recommendations are a bit out of date now, but they're still worth reading. All the links still work (Amazon UK).</div>

<div class="content">I’m only familiar with one book of that lot: E-myth. Which I don’t personally recommend unless you are in an industry resembling the food and hospitality services he talks about. I know I’m a rare bird in this one, as it’s very commonly ranked high in business circles. I found it quite readable, but I failed to take practical value out. <br><br>Meanwhile, I’ve read dozens of books (though  not hundreds) but of the rest of these none.   Wouldn’t know which to pick.</div>

<div class="content">The forum software didn't link the whole URL since it doesn't match the http part but it does the http part. You have to copy the whole thing. (Or I believe Mark might end up manually fixing the URL and/or the original page.)</div>
