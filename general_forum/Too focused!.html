<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-10 0:16</div>
<div class="content">First of all, thanks to Mark for setting up this beta and creating this system.<br><br>A little background: I was a floundering GTDer for a couple of years with my procrastination and its resistance was preventing me from fully embracing the GTD methodology. (I was NEVER able to complete a "weekly review").  Perhaps the New Year inspires us to refresh, so I started at the GTD forums looking for ideas and saw others discussing DIT. I then found Mark's site just in time for his introduction of AF. I signed up for the Beta and received his intro email after I got home on Tuesday. After kids were asleep, I started developing my list and ended up staying up until 1am. <br><br>So far I have 99 items on my 4 page work list with 32 crossed off and only one "dismissed" so far.<br><br>The amazing thing has been my focus. Somehow picking the task that stands out has so little resistance that I easily gain momentum and stay focused for a longer time than before when I was working on a "next action". It seems like the task was like a boulder on the top of a hill and just starting working on it starts it rolling down and its momentum is difficult to stop. Sometimes that's a good thing. Sometimes not, like if I have something I need to complete today, but I've been on such a roll on a different task that I lose track of time. <br><br>So what I started doing is jotting a timestamp next to my task of when I started. If I feel I'm rolling downhill too long I can do a quick check to see how long I've been working on this task. Since I started it, most of the time, it's more than 30 minutes. When I stop, I jot an endtime. This way I'm starting to get a handle on how long I'm working on things which I suppose could be useful in estimating work load in the future.<br><br>I'll check in again next week to see if any of the "new-ness" excitement has worn off.<br><br>-John<br></div>

<div class="content">John - you might try the super simple Egg timer for your PC at <a href="http://www.ACAPsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ACAPsoft.com</a> .  (Lots of options, but really easy to use to simply count up or down.)<br><br>I see it's up to $12.50 so it's a bit pricey.  But it does offer many options and has several uses.</div>

<div class="content">If you want a timer against tasks, you could try Abstract Spoon's ToDoList2 <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/applications/todolist2.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/applications/todolist2.aspx</a> ); many more options than you probably want. Free and Open Source. Show only the columns you want. If you want to use it to contain AF, you could make it a page to a database - and all open databases are shown on separate tabs so it is very easy to move from one to the other. For each task you start the timer when you start and stop when you stop and it keeps a running total; you can edit that total manually if you forget to start/stop it sometimes. Always assumes you are happy having the PC running all the time.</div>

<div class="content">Just before AF I was trying to use Time Log, from Alec Mackenzie's book, "The Time Trap".<br><br>I think I will keep the Time Log when needed.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting idea, John.  Thank you.<br><br>One question to the Forum.  Maybe I, still, don´t quite understand.  In the above phrase "So far I have 99 items on my 4 page work list with 32 crossed off and only one "dismissed" so far.", how come one, *and just one* item can be dismissed?  As I understand, you dismiss *entire* pages, when not even one item in such page stands out as actionable.<br><br>Am I OK or there is something else?<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Spencer<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">There's no reason why an item should not be dismissed on its own - that could count as the action. But you are right that the idea is that whole pages are dismissed if/when nothing stands out. Not sure I'll do that myself if I have a tired/not feeling up to it day; I wouldn't expect much to stand out then.</div>

<div class="content">I have some items I now know will end up being dismissed but am leaving them until I can dismiss all remaining items on the relevant page.  No magic reason, just that I have this feeling that it will give me an immense amount of satisfaction .... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Spencer:<br><br>Unless you have filled an entire page with intractable problems, it is very unlikely that you wouldn't do at least one item every time you visit a page. Therefore when you do finally dismiss items on a page, it will probably be only one or two.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for your responses.<br><br>Mark, I think your above response finally help me understand that issue.<br><br>Yesterday I bought a little Rhein notebook specially for AF.  It its pages are 4 1/2 x 6".<br><br></div>
