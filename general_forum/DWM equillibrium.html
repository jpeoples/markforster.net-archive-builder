<div class="content">In AF, the end of your list grows.  For some people it grows and grows.  In DWM, growth occurs on the Week page and filters forward to day 1.  (The rest is always ~21 days of unactioned ideas.)  <br><br>This is the key metric: Number of active tasks in the hot pages (today upto next week) .  Count how many tasks you crossed off between Day 1 and Day 8.  Count how many were added to Day 8.  Add Day 9.  Are you gaining, losing, or holding?  Unless you are finishing things as fast as they come in, your list will grow, and you are falling behind.  <br><br>* Some tasks are recurrent, so working on them doesn't help.  <br>* Finish tasks on your hot pages.<br>* Let non-important tasks fall off.<br>* Work on tasks 1 month out as you want.  In the long term it's just as good because the chosen tasks enter the hot pages early and leave them early.<br><br>The system works for you if it prevents you from spending all your time on the big stuff and neglecting the details.  The seven day window *should* be enough to allow you to work little by little, once a week on minor tasks, and still be able to devote larger chunks of time to the important stuff.  <br><br>The system works *against* you if it forces you to do too many little tasks and not spend enough time on the important ones.  The Current Initiative tool corrects this imbalance if it's a problem.<br><br>In the end, if you have too many tasks, DWM will force them off the list.  This will be your sign to rethink your commitments and try to achieve equilibrium.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I like this summary you've crafted, clean and crisp, especially the "hot pages" emphasis.<br><br>As you may have seen elsewhere, I'm using ListPro now to update the DWM list, print it out (I can get the list within one A4 page by printing the list with A5 settings) and then use in manual paper mode (new tasks are first captured in pen, completed or tackled ones crossed out with the pen), process the tasks addressed, and add new ones, in ListPro at the end of the day.  I also synchronise ListPro with the file on my WM device (HTC Touch Pro 2) for when I'm out and about, but during the day I try to use the single sheet of paper only even when at my desk (standing height!) in the office or out on errands.<br><br>I'm using a Closed List status for the stuff I want to do on the day, and these can include any Current Initiative.items.<br><br>For recurring and admin type stuff, I have a Daily Routine, Weekly Routine and a Monthly Routine which appear on the list when they are due (Daily every day, Weekly comes in on Friday etc).  These are crossed out on the paper list so that their ListPro equivalent can be retained.<br><br>I want to ensure I include the "big stuff" and do this by using ListPro to break the work down into discrete "do-able" chunks via sub-tasks.  Thus when I open the project which hopefully shows progress with tackled sub-tasks already crossed out.<br><br>Outlook remains for hard date commitments, and, of course, meetings, travel etc.  I'm trying to use emails in a DWM way, putting reminders on the appropriate date, but "emails" is still a sub-task within my Daily Routine.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Roger.  It took me a long time to write.  My aim was to clarify things in my own mind about what it takes to make the system work well.  Remarkably, the system appears to be pretty good at encouraging the right kinds of activity, except that it needs to be strongly balanced by some other impetus to work on the current initiatives.  <br><br>To put another way, if your goal is already to focus on the big stuff, then DWM will let you do so while reminding you of all the little things.  If you have no big goal, DWM will just keep your busy work running smoothly.  I think your suggestion of breaking down big stuff into lots of small stuff is very good and works well for DWM.</div>
