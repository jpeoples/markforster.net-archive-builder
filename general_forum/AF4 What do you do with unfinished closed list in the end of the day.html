<div class="content">I started trying AF4 few days ago and so far I like it. However, questions do arise.<br><br>Quite often my "closed list" isn't finished in the end of the day + there are some more items in the open list. Next day I join them all + few items coming from morning email into new closed list (so that new items would have a chance for quick reaction). That certainly results into bigger and bigger closed list every day. What do you do in this kind of situation?</div>

<div class="content">Artem:<br><br>You are doing it wrong. The idea is that you should not add to the closed list at all. You should continue with the current closed list until it is completed - that may take much longer than a day.</div>

<div class="content">The solution to this problem is to follow the rules. Don't join the closed and open list each day! The open list gets closed only whe all tasks on the closed list are done or dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">Aha, misunderstood the animated demo then. Thanks!<br>I'll try the correct way.<br><br>What would you do with urgent tasks if you can't work on anything outside of closed list then?<br>Or maybe with not-really-urgent, but still requiring faster reply than you would provide after finishing the long closed list?</div>

<div class="content">«Aha, misunderstood the animated demo then.» <br><br>The demo consists of a single day. The open list is not closed at the beginning of the day, it is closed somewhere in the middle when Mark completes a first pass of the closed list without taking action, dismissing all tasks in the closed list. If you point out confusing parts in the demo, I can correct them.<br><br>«What would you do with urgent tasks if you can't work on anything outside of closed list then?»<br><br>There is never a situation in which you can't work on something outside the closed list. You can move out of the closed list at any time. The only difference - if you didn't do a single task on the closed list beforehand, you have to dismiss the tasks in the closed list. If you did even the tiniest little thing for any task on the closed list, you can move into the open list at any time without dismissing anything.<br><br>«Or maybe with not-really-urgent, but still requiring faster reply than you would provide after finishing the long closed list?» <br><br>Same as above, just move out of the closed list into the open list and do it. You don't have to finish the closed list before doing stuff from the open list. Watch the demo again and note how often Mark actions tasks on his open list.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for reply.<br><br>Hmm, I've seen on demo indeed how often Mark goes through open list. The precondition for it is always that he did nothing for closed list (and it happens for him quite often). In my case I almost always do at least a bit on some closed list task.. need to think about it. Maybe I should feel less "obliged" to do at least something on the closed list round.</div>

If you know there is an important task in the open list you have to get to, the tasks in the closed list are less important and you'll skip them in favor of the important one.</div>

<div class="content">On the other hand, even if you work only a tiny little bit on a task each pass, that task gets still removed from the closed list and attached to the end of the open list. This should reduce your closed list pretty quickly, especially if you don't inflate it every day like you did previously.</div>

<div class="content">Aha, that's probably the part I managed to miss!<br>Remove the task from the closed list even if I worked on it just a bit (so far I tend to remove it only if I executed a reasonable piece of a task).<br><br>Thanks for an advice!</div>
