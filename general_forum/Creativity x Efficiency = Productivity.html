<div class="content">Did I get that right?<br><br>If so, then searching this site for the number of articles for "creativity" (724 articles) and "productivity" (2634) gives an efficiency of about 36%.<br><br>My point being that creativity methods are a minority interest. Shame.</div>

<div class="content">Actually, 724 x 2634 = 1907016<br><br>How did you get 36%? Show your work.<br><br>Why do you define "creativity" as "the number of posts on a blog about creativity"? Doesn't every blog post require creativity?<br><br>Are you a troll?</div>

<div class="content">Sorry but your post just seems extremely hostile, as in "you say one thing but do another." It seems really rude.</div>

<div class="content">Mark's book makes it clear that while you can change efficiency or creativity to see an effect on productivity, he is going to focus on the efficiency part of the equation. <br><br>This equation is a great way to think about work, and only one of many gems inside this book.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br><< My point being that creativity methods are a minority interest. Shame. >><br><br>This blog is about time management and personal organization, not creativity, so you should regard the 724 articles on creativity as a bonus. <br><br>There's plenty about creativity in the book.</div>

<div class="content">Productivity and creativy are the most important things nowadays. I see those two features in every place in uor lifies. Even in legal area. Recently I have heard about “no win no fee” type of work. It is defenitely connetcet with creativity and productivity, without them no money be gained. The are the best example such things:  <a href="http://www.bonnaraccidentlaw.com/contact/glasgow" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.bonnaraccidentlaw.com/contact/glasgow</a></div>

<div class="content">Very neat, Michael!<br><br>:0)<br><br>However, I make efficiency: 2634 / 724 = 3.6 ish<br><br>Don R,<br><br>Of course this is whimsy. It didn't come across to me as in the least bit rude. <br><br>Mark,<br><br>Nicely put!</div>

<div class="content">Applying the Turing test to the posts from michael and robinbloomer above, I judge that michael is definitely human and robinbloomer is definitely a spambot.<br><br>This is true even though I can actually understand what robinbloomer is driving at ("click this link because somebody somewhere will benefit by your doing so"), whereas I have no idea what michael is on about.<br><br>I find that fascinating.<br><br>If robinbloomer is actually a human being, I apologize to him/her. And of course, the converse apology to michael if I'm wrong about him.</div>

<div class="content">Chris,<br><br>My best guess is that Michael is regretting the small number of posts on creativity, in a lightly whimsical manner.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Will</div>
