<div class="content">Jonathan Fields writes a blog called "Awake at the Wheel".  He had a very good article today on visualization - he advocates visualization of the steps to achievement rather than of the goal itself (process simulation rather than outcome simulation).  There's research to back this up too. :-)<br><br><a href="http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/the-truth-about-vizualization-and-goal-achievement/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/the-truth-about-vizualization-and-goal-achievement/</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks Jacqueline - good article.  Wasn't it you that mentioned Body For Life?  I did it too several years ago and I'm wondering what it was about that structured program that made it 'easy' to stick with.  Sometimes I come up with a goal and steps to get me there but I lose enthusiasm and quit.  I'm reading this article with that question in mind.  (As well as other posts here, Mark's suggestions, and the book 'Rapt' [thanks Peter]).</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Jaqueline, that's a great article.<br><br>I especially liked one of the comments:<br><br>'.... Visualization was a huge part of my whitewater racing career with USA Canoe/Kayak. While I’m certain that nearly every athlete who walks into an Olympic Opening Ceremony dreams or visualizes themselves standing on the Olympic medal podium, I never found it to be a productive visualization. Paddling the whitewater Olympic whitewater venue was complicated enough. So that was our visualization objective....'</div>

<div class="content">Hi Zane,<br><br>I think one of the things about BFL or any of that type of short term program is that it gets you enthused to see just how much you can accomplish in only 12 weeks.  If you break it down that's ONLY 40 measly hours of working out - and what's that?  What kind of loser can't do that?  (I'm talking myself into it again here ...)   :-)<br><br>You have pictures of people who start out kind of pudgy and out of shape and look awesome after to model yourself after; and you have a very reasonable diet where you're never hungry and get to indulge once in awhile.   And once you've been working out for just 2-3 weeks, you start feeling how strong you're getting and that's motivating as well.   <br><br>Somewhere I've got Bill Phillips' original magazine editorial where he first started promoting the BFL contest to give away his Ferrari.  I'll dig it up and post some tips, because I do remember it as being phenomenally motivating.  <br><br>I didn't sign up and send stuff in etc., but I did keep with the program for a couple of years afterwards (switched jobs, worked crazy hours and let my weightlifting go) - I do miss having that muscle definition though.  <br><br>Smileypete, Yes - I noticed the same comment too and thought of an olympic bobsledder I heard speak once and he had said the same thing - they dream of the medal, but they truly visualize on the process more.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>Call me selfish but I found great thrills and exciting challenges and passion in BOTH the process/mastery   and in the glory of winning or placing well.  I loved the whole package!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning, I have the feeling you're like me and have a competitive streak in you - even if it's only being competitive with yourself.  :-)<br><br>Zane, <br><br>I was thinking about this further, and I think a key component of enthusiasm is the level of belief and certainty you have about the outcome.  In something like BFL, you KNOW if you complete those workouts and the way of eating as prescribed, you WILL achieve those results.  It's virtually impossible not to, unless you're an extreme endomorph (in which case you'll have to adapt the program, but will still have decent results).   It's like following a recipe out of a cookbook - follow the steps and the result has to occur.<br><br>Here's a good article on it:<br><a href="http://www.rockyourday.com/the-wrong-way-to-think-about-your-goals-and-how-to-fix-it/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockyourday.com/the-wrong-way-to-think-about-your-goals-and-how-to-fix-it/</a><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>Yes, you are so correct.  As long as I can remember, I've been excited and thrilled to learn/master/create.  Competing with others is only a temporary distraction and reward for testing the results of my unending devotion to self growth in a particular area.  Also it's fun to be around others who share my passions.  I can both learn from them and get a social reward from long, hard, solitary work in pursuit of mastery.  Jacqueline....judging from what I can glean from your posts, we do share several touchpoints.  I intuit that you like to merge passion with intellect to whatever end you choose.....even if it's listening to bullfrogs while you're warming yourself at the campfire!  Broadening ourselves in any capacity can only make us better able to live our life.....which engenders BOTH confidence and gratitude......Are you sentimental also? I actually believe that it aides my logic in *most* cases!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Even if I didn't win or my team didn't win, the experience was still thrilling and fun.  There's something intrinsically beneficial in challenges, period!  Sometimes, achieving personal glory is even more appreciated when I have to go back to the "lab", work out the kinks, get stronger, smarter, etc......the greater the challenge, the better the ride!  ROTFL!!!!!  (I've got far too many scars for any "proper" woman!  Doctors have even offered to remove them.......why?  It's patina!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>
