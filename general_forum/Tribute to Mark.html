<div class="content">Mark, your work, particularly the book "Do It Tomorrow" has had the greatest impact on my personal and professional life of any other expert I've read. Got me through law school and into an interesting and rewarding career. Couldn't have done it without you, thank you for making me a better human and sharing your knowledge with all of us. Kind regards, Tim</div>
