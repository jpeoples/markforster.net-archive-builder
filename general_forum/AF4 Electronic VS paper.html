<div class="content">Hi All<br><br>There are several posts of this forum about using AF4 in electronic form and in paper form. It looks like both way can work (it's just a list after all), but I can't find any comparison of pros and cons of electronic and paper versions.<br><br>Is there anybody who used AF4 in a paper way and then consciously switched to computer or vice versa? It would be great to to hear reasons for making a conscious switch.<br><br>I am currently thinking about trying autofocus and can't decide whether I want to start with electronic version in OneNote (currently I am using GTD in OneNote) or with paper version. My context: management, single big project (dozens of projects in GTD terms) with dozens of emails a day. Plus some personal side as well. <br><br>Best regards,<br>Artem.</div>

<div class="content">I would recommend to start on paper until you've got the knack of its mechanics. Once it's running, you can still switch to electronic, if you still like. (A lot of people don't.)<br><br>It's a question of learning. Like in school when you first have to learn to calculate yourself, before you're allowed to use an electronic calculator. It would be a sad thing if you came to the conclusion that AF wouldn't work for you when it was in fact the fault of any software.</div>

<div class="content">"Is there anybody who used AF4 in a paper way and then consciously switched to computer or vice versa"<br><br>I started out on paper and very quickly switched to computer (google tasks -> omnifocus -> The Hit List -> FocusPad -> LEFT AF4 -> The Hit List.<br><br>Even though it lacks an iPhone app, I love The Hit List. I've been using it for AF4 - with success - for a couple of weeks.</div>

<div class="content">I started out on paper but now I'm using Andreas's AutofocusAHK application.  I've got a ton of work done with it today.  Any time you think of something you need to do, you just hit Capslock-A and away you go.  If you want to see what you've got lined up, you hit capslock-E and you see a list.  It takes care of the rules for you, so you don't have to ask whether you're doing it right or not.<br><br>Of course, I'm doing a lot of my work in front of a computer.  If I weren't, I might prefer pen and paper.</div>

<div class="content">Paper has three huge advantages:<br>1) it's easy<br>2) it's always available<br>Electronic has these advantages:<br>1) editing<br>2) searching<br>3) automated functions (tracking, etc)<br><br>The big disadvantage of electronic is it's easy to overcomplicate things.  If you have a tendency to get lost working on systems, paper may be better simply because this system is fixed in place for you, and you can get to actioning.</div>

<div class="content">I have a huge problem. For the moment i am unable to choose.<br>I wich to precise that nothing is easy for me and i need to change of system when there is proscratrination. .<br><br>Anyway, Paper is great with me for managing and integrate in your brain info. Digital is fantastic for managing infos. <br><br>After a lot of trials and many swich from one to the other  i finaly decided at the moment to use both of them.  I got rid of Omnifocus wich was to heavy for me and took the free mac EVERNOTE .  I put on it all my projetct, checklist and list of projects. I still had them on paper last week !<br><br>I use a A4 english notebook for my paper AF4 following a very interesting AF4 explain i saw last week <a href="http://blog.alecsatin.com/autofocus4/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.alecsatin.com/autofocus4/</a><br><br>As usual it works but for how many time. <br><br>My real difficulty is that i am just unable to stick on a system. I need perpetual change to find and reach my equilibrium. Howerver i keep some essential rules wich are definitvly unchanging even if the way of the system itself is evoluting or mooving.<br><br>These are keeping list of things, using checklist, working on project with a GTD manner, using AF4 list as my diary guidline. <br><br>I guess Iwould be unable to so much thanks indeed Mark Forster who indeed changed my life with his method. Nothing except GTD made me progressing so fast well and easely since the last 20 years, even if the system is mooving little by littly and step by step. <br><br>Hope this help</div>

<div class="content">I always find that as time goes on systems tend to get more complex.  You may be at a point where you need to simplify to the easiest thing that works for you.  I said in a thread last year which got mixed reviews that once you do a bit of AF with a touch of GTD and a pinch of Covey, what you have done in essence is created a whole new system.  Now that may be fine if in fact this is what you need to be productive, but the first thing I would try to do is reduce the complexity of your system.<br><br>As a general comment not intended to be a criticism, I personally don't think time management systems solve nor are they meant to solve procrastination problems.  They solve organization problems.  Tinkering with systems is a sign of procrastination, but a new system will not solve it.  I am not sure I have the procrastination cure, but this awareness may help.  Good luck<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">I'm an extremely 'digital person'. About a year ago I even stopped printing scientific articles; for environmental purposes, but mainly because digital annotations were so much more useful (Skim and OSX system-wide search are a godsend). My calendar is digital, even my note-taking is often digital. I keep paper tot a minimum.<br><br>Having said that, I've made a conscious decision to use AF with paper. With GTD, this was too cumbersome, and I used OmniFocus (and before that Things). With AF, it was finally possible, and I can say that it's been a very smart decision for me.<br><br>There are two reasons why I would advise a paper AF setup: separation and psychology.<br><br>Concerning the first, I've found that computers, as awesome as they are for storing and retrieving, have a tendency to make everything blur together. I've become such a power user that in the time span of five minutes I can 1) go into itunes to select a song, 2) open photoshop to edit some file, 3) while it loads open gmail and check new messages, 4) click on a link in this email, 5) 'watch' the link in the background while opening my task system app 'du jour', and do a bunch of other things.<br><br>I find that it's verry difficult to open the task 'system' and focus solely on that, disregarding mail popups, msn messages, song changes. Even if I turn all that stuff off, it's literally one keypress away (system-wide shortcuts), and hard to tune out. Our brains aren't made to handle that. With a paper system, I have to physically move my hands from the keyboard, pick up a pen, open the book, move aside the laptop, and focus on the list. World of difference. Sometimes I even move to the couch, away from the computer.<br><br>Concerning the latter (psychology), I find that it is greatly more satisfying to cross off a task on paper, because it's solid. I take more time to think of phrasing my task. I have an archive of old tasks that I can look back on in satisfaction. Text on a computer is just to easy to move around, add, etc. It's too fleeting and insignificant. In fact, research seems to support this, find that, among other things, note-taking on paper makes things stay in your head better than digital note-taking [citation needed due to laziness].<br><br>So really, it's just one reason: psychology. Unless it's too impractical to use a paper setup, AF(4) is so simple that there's now little excuse to opt for digital.</div>

<div class="content">I agree that a paper list is probably the best for most people, but when I tried it on paper, I got constantly distracted by the number of items on the list and how "messy" it began to look.<br><br>For years I've wanted a system that would be simple enough to maintain as a trusted system but one that would also give me "JUST ONE THING" to do now. The Autofocus system is perfect for me, but I need something electronic or mechanical to turn the autofocus list into a "JUST ONE THING" right now kind of system.<br><br>So, I built one myself. I'm using it now, but I'd like to get feedback from others on whether they think it might work for them, so I'm releasing it as a public alpha.<br><br>It requires a login, but if you don't want to create a new account, you can try the testing account (user: testing, pass: testing)<br><br>Here's the URL: <a href="http://www.autofocus.me" rel="nofollow">http://www.autofocus.me</a><br><br>Please let me know if it's helpful or if you have any suggestions.</div>

<div class="content">Hilko - in principal, I agree with you. I remember Beck echoing a similar sentiment vis-a-vis technology and songwriting.  <br><br>However, writing didn't work for me because: <br><br>1) I have multiple roles/projects (as a Scanner - see Barbara Sher - I like it that way) that need  tags/project-folders to create a modicum of organization. <br><br>2) Like Jeff, my written list became a mess that, in time, I dreaded using<br><br>3) I often need to search for items that I need to do (or have done) <br><br>Still, your "separation and psychology" points are sound, and impact many areas of work/personal life.</div>

<div class="content">I found the written list functional, but:<br>- I felt I was spending too much time scanning lists of closed tasks for the few open ones and<br>- you need a small list you can carry everywhere. Not a huge problem in theory, except I tended to rely on the small lists and forget the master list. <br>Having said that, when I was disciplined, this worked pretty well.<br><br>I am now back with an Outlook task list, (synched to Toodledo on my new iPod Touch).<br>- allows me to drag mails from a mailbox review<br>- main view is active tasks only, in increasing order of date modified<br>Disadvantage is that the list does tend to grow, with similar but not quite identical tasks coming in from a number of sources. I have a "prune list" task that goes on from time to time. Nevertheless, if you have a lot of mail, I would recommend that you try this. I haven't changed it for months, which is my main metric for a process.<br><br>YMMV, of course.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you all for advice.<br><br>I decided to start with paper for a change. A slight problem was whether to separate Home and Work lists - I started separate lists and just rewrite items to a different list sometimes (e.g. when a home-related "arrange car maintenance" item requires action during work time - "call the car shop").<br><br>Tickler, sometimes/maybe and calendar specific stuff I still manage electronically (in OneNote and Outlook). I will probably post here after some time to describe the longer term impressions.</div>

<div class="content">Well definitivly I would add nothing but paper is much better for AF there is a feeling of pleasure about crossing tasks wich never happens with digital. More i noticed that i have a much better feeling of task wich make me elimiating many of them and this never happen with digital. What else ?</div>
