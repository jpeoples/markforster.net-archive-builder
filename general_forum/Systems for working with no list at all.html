<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">For the moment, I'm succumbing to resistance to writing everything down (cf. <a href="../general_forum/Level of task and processing speed.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2786084</a> ). I might take a break from my "no-list" list for a few days. So, I'm entertaining the possibility of working with no list at all. Has anyone found a successful way of doing this? I've worked with no list at all (and asystematically) previously. It wasn't all bad, but there is a tendency to "drift" (to use Mark's word).<br><br>In the past, I've also tested Mark's questions "What am I resisting not doing?" and "Is this what I want to be doing?" (the latter may work best with the "Dreams" approach; unfortunately, I stopped short of fully implementing that). Some good results, but one difficulty with stand-alone questions is that it can be tough to keep asking them. And the cognitive load can be heavier than simply writing a task down.<br><br>Mark's "What am I resisting?" question (from "Get Everything Done") seems attractive, but I'm not sure it adequately addresses low-resistance tasks or tasks that have moved from high-resistance to low-resistance (both presumably would not be selected). I might be misunderstanding here.<br><br>One possibility that crosses my mind in light of Mark's recent blog post would be to work without a list but to use a timer to add structure (and some concentration) to one's work.<br><br>Anyway, any other ideas for stand-alone questions for deciding what to do without a list? Any approaches for working effectively with no list at all? Or am I going to be heading back to some form of list pretty soon?<br><br>Relevant reading:<br><br><a href="../blog/Types of List V - Using no list at all.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/1/29/types-of-list-v-using-no-list-at-all.html</a><br><a href="../blog/Powerful Questions.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/11/16/powerful-questions.html</a></div>

<div class="content">I have many times contemplated your question but the answer has always been: can’t be done successfully. Can be done unsuccessfully and i’ve many times been there.</div>

Just go with the first thing that comes to mind. I always found that resistance to the task disappeared with the answer.<br><br>It would certainly be worth your while to try it out.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, Mark.<br><br>One clarification about the Resistance Principle: Is the optimal time to ask "What am I resisting?" a) before you start a task (in order to choose a task) or b) after you have started a task (in order to determine whether you should continue or switch to something else)?<br><br>In most of your systems, task selection takes place at moment a). But the following article made me think that "What am I resisting?" is meant to be asked at moment b), because of the theory that you are either currently doing the optimal action or resisting it. (If I recall, this last idea was not explicit in the "Get Everything Done" chapter.)<br><br><a href="../blog/The Resistance Principle.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2007/1/13/the-resistance-principle.html</a><br><br>I'm sorry if I'm overthinking this. It's an interesting idea--but taking some time to grasp.</div>

<div class="content">Mark's book "Dreams" outlines a no-list-at-all system based on journaling activities and pull-mode. It's awesome. After a while pull-mode sets in and it's a terrific feeling.</div>

But you can also use it if necessary while you are doing a task to check whether you should still be doing it or whether you should move on to something else.</div>

I recently ordered a paper copy of Dreams, so I will have a chance to look at it more closely.</div>
