<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>Could people here give me some help by sharing the methods of getting in touch with their own deepest life purposes that they've found most practical and effective? (I say 'get in touch with' because I'm sure such things are discovered, not decided.) I know this often comes up indirectly on this forum, and if it's been discussed lately, I apologize and would appreciate being pointed to the relevant thread. It's been a long time since I've practised deep soul-searching - I think because I became discouraged. And I also became preoccupied with time management at the expense of goal-setting.<br><br>TIA,<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Well Chris, this hasn't been discussed lately. I can't say I have practical and effective goals and purpose yet, but I think I'm getting close. A bunch of random points:<br><br>Goals without self-management (time management) doesn't get you far; you need both.<br>Deciding your purpose and setting goals are two different things.<br>Regarding purpose, it makes sense that it ought to connect to your make. What are you good at? What do you like?  What do you value? What is important?<br>As a Christian, I found The Purpose Driven Life somewhat helpful, it's only a partial answer I think. <br>Purpose, to me, is hard to act on. It's not usually one thing but many. <br>Goals are specific objectives you set for yourself. Try to choose ones that agree with your purpose.  If they clash, change goals or refine your purpose. <br> Start small, succeed small, then go bigger. <br><br>Think about my Purpose is a recurring task for me. In that, I evaluate what I'm doing (review list) and consider if it aligns well with my conept of my purpose. I may then try to come up with new activities to balance. <br>Replace movie watching with something more engaging.</div>

<div class="content">Now this is a really interesting thread and very relevant to me. I've been so busy (almost for years) that I have just been moving through activties without any real direction. <br><br>I lost my Father last week after quite a long illness and it has opened up quite a few questions for me.  Because his final stage of illness involved just over 2 weeks in hospital I suddenly found myself with time to think as I sat there keeping my Mother company and driving there and back. My head suddenly rejected all the drive I had to work and I seemed to mentally step back from it and observe from afar. Even now nearly a week after he died, I still find myself reluctant to take up the reins again.<br><br>It has also made me consider my own mortality - if I live as long as my Dad (he was 87) I have roughly 30 years left - what do I want to do and achieve in that time?  Whilst I don't have any large goals (for example climbing a mountain or running a marathon!) I would like to achieve some personal goals I think and also I would like to shrug off some bad personal habits and thoughts and take on some better ones (this is probably what Alan has termed 'purpose') quite what yet I am not sure.<br><br>So for me I am still thinking about this, but feel that any contributions to this process would be very helpful.<br><br>Also I have observed in one or two friends how they have set themselves a large goal (for example building a huge georgian house!) and gradually seen it evolve. This has made me realise how important a goal can be to achieving things in life. Actually identifying what you - writing it down - want can make it happen.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the nice thought Erik. He had been ill for a long time so it was expected - still makes you stop in your tracks though and want to re-evaluate your life. I suppose I am trying to make something positive come out of this.</div>

<div class="content">By 'purpose' I mean the reason God made you the way you are and put you in your position on life.  If you don't believe God has such a purpose, then I suppose you would seek to invent your own. I believe God has given us purpose but invites us to realize it for ourselves.<br><br>In either case your purpose is intimitely tied to your personality, your situation, your talents, and your values. Pursue activities that accord.</div>

<div class="content">Many thanks for the mention of DO IT.  I try to limit myself to three main goals and use daily feedback to keep me on track.  The selection of these three goals is as much art as science and I find I know when I have selected things that I am excited about as I will work on them with no resistance.  So for me improve my guitar playing never is a problem whereas clean the garage seems overwhelming.   Seriously the key for me has been the feedback mechanism to keep me on track, this is written in a notebook each day.  It is a simple principal but it works, because for me I do not want to write something weak or nothing at all,<br><br>Good luck<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Two kind-of journaling exercises. One would be The "What Color Is Your Parachute" workbook section, the "flower exercise."<br><br>The other is this post from Steve Pavlina's blog that my own coach gave to me: <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/01/how-to-discover-your-life-purpose-in-about-20-minutes/." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/01/how-to-discover-your-life-purpose-in-about-20-minutes/.</a> The key is the step where you keep writing things down until you start crying, and then you've found your purpose.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>I completely forgot until now about this technique that I am about to write.  It has been some time since I had last done this until now, but I will attest to its surprisingly, and sometimes embarrassingly, candid yet accurate revelation of your innermost thoughts and desires. It is also quick, easy, and fun!<br><br>You will need: a piece of paper, and a pen or pencil.<br><br>1.  Place the paper on the table in landscape orientation.<br><br>2.  Think about the question you want to answer about yourself, then try to forget about it for the next steps.<br><br>3.  Think of eight words, the first ones you can think of, or ones you read from your surroundings, and write them side by side at the top.<br><br>4.  Pair each word with its neighbor (first and second, third and fourth, fifth and sixth, seventh and eighth) by connecting a line between them.  You should now have four pairs of words.<br><br>5. Look at each pair, and think of a word that would describe their relationship with each other.  Write the FIRST word that comes into your mind below the line connecting the pair.  You should know have four new words.<br><br>6.  Again, pair each word with its neighbor using lines, as before.  You should now have two pairs.<br><br>7.  Again, look at each pair, and think of a word that would describe their relationship with each other.  Write the FIRST word that comes into your mind below the line connecting the pair.  You should know have two new words.<br><br>8.  Finally, pair the last two words, and think of a word describing their relationship with each other.  Write the FIRST word that comes into your mind below the line connecting the pair.  THIS is the answer of your subconscious to your question.<br><br>Now, if the answer is nonsensical, do not write it off right away.  Ruminate on the answer for a while; it might surprise you.<br><br>For example, I accidentally erased the first version of this post earlier.  As you can see, it was quite long, and that really ticked me off.  I then thought of this weird idea of doing this technique to find out what to do next.  SO I did, with the question, "What do I do now?"<br><br>The answer I got was NONSENSE.  Yep, the word NONSENSE. Huh? <br><br>After a few moments scratching my head, I then realized that in my first version of this post I never did include about what to do when you get a "nonsense" answer like what I had a few moments before (literally).  I just laughed and typed again, and well, you got this post. ^_____^<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Did you have a clear question you were clearly thinking about Mark?  I didn't.  And "Yellow" doesn't seem to answer anything for me.  I'm not one to believe such exercises always work.  I could imagine there's a non-zero probability of successful outcome, but I wouldn't take a single word as anything more than possibly a hint.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Well, you are right Alan, I think the exercise gives more of "hints," therefore if you started without a question you really will be stuck with a very obscure word.<br><br>If I may be so bold, Mark, PERISH is another word for "death", and, Alan, YELLOW is the color of cowardice.<br><br>Sorry if I am too presumptuous, but this exercise, as I said, can be very candid, maybe even TOO candid.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Usually I don't worry about My Big Purpose, and concentrate more on the small and medium things. If I find it, great. If not, at least I'll have lived a decent life.<br><br>Truth be told, I'm a little scared it might need big sacrifices or be beyond me. Yes, if it's truly my calling I won't mind the sacrifice (much), and the purpose might include striving rather than completing, but I'm in no hurry to start measuring my progress towards such a goal.<br><br>Raising the kids to be productive, positive members of society is important, but if you asked me that question when I was in school (I'm a licensed professional engineer), I would have said I could and should do more. Being "just a housewife" sounded like a cop-out. My female classmates are doing so much more.<br><br>Steve Palina's purpose was small. It was mostly about how he relates to himself and to the world. Only one of the four points dealt with other people, and then only vaguely. I've always assumed that a mission should mostly be about your effect on others and accepted more personal purposes as "good enough for now, but probably not My Big Purpose". This frees up a whole new area to explore.</div>

<div class="content">I think Cricket nailed it about Pavlina, and about Purpose needing to be broader than self.  <br><br>Since I have several contradictory opinions on the subject, I'll share another. :-)<br><br>Purpose is not necessarily a given, and it's not necessarily about finding the correct answer. What you are doing now may be fine. The  point of the purpose exercise is to think of better things you can do. If you discover something that fits you better ( you like it more, you are more competent, you feel more satisfied doing it, you provide better value to the community ), then move in that directon.  Forget 'ultimate purpose' and look for 'better'. <br><br>Leon, I think you're right also. Review what you are doing and think what you can do better.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe this "search for a big purpose" is like the perfect job. Many kids these days think that there is a perfect job out there that they should be doing, all they have to do is search their souls (with the help of professionals and self-help books) to find it.<br><br>That type of thinking devalues the daily grind. There is value in small routine things. I think it was Ghandi who made all his followers sweep the floors and spin cotton. Those acts were political and economic statements, but they were also spiritual.<br><br>I'm not saying you should stick with a job you hate, or that you shouldn't work towards a job you love, but you shouldn't hate the job you have just because you think you can "do better". What is doing better?</div>

<div class="content">If you're doing a menial job, raising kids, helping in the community, and you're happy with it all, wonderful!  Many many people are not happy.  And they assume there's notthing to be done about it.  Too many people don't even look.  Many other people look in the wrong direction and don't think whether it really leads where they hope.<br><br>And then there's me.  I'm generally happy where I'm at, but I believe I can be more useful to people [and have greater satisfaction] if I develop skills and match my gifts and interests to helpful service.</div>

<div class="content">Leo Babuta's take on the subject:<br><<In other words, discovering passion requires a dedication to unstructured exploration. You have to leave large swathes of free time in your schedule (a technique I call underscheduling), and fill this time with the exploration of things that might be interesting. Of equal importance, when something catches your attention you must leverage your free time to aggressively follow up.>><br><br>Pasted from <a href="http://zenhabits.net/cultivating-passion/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/cultivating-passion/</a></div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>Interesting that in the article it says that Steve Martin re-defined "diligence" as the ability *not to work* on tasks unrelated to your main goal. In Do It Tomorrow I make the point that a commitment is as much about what you are not going to do as about what you are going to do.</div>

<div class="content">Seeking for "big purpose" and "passion" often lead to passion burnout. I loved classical music (opera mainly), did my degree in musicology and work for opera house for eight years. I quit two years ago and since that time visited opera house only once (my bellowed Puccini's Tosca in Wiener Staatsoper with H.Papian) and you know what... I was more pleased to see polar bears jumping into water in Schonbrunn zoo then listening to "E lucevan le stelle" from 3 act.<br><br>Luckily to me, my dream about becoming orchestra conductor did not happen, as I would have serious problem getting out of opera world, and as my job was half administrative/half artistic I was able easily and successfully transfer to new career as entrepreneurship owner (somehow still lightly connected to culture market).<br><br>It took me some years to discover that passion still can be passion and you do not have make living from it (before, for me making living from passion meant that your are pro, and rest are amateurs).<br><br>Also you can fuel your big purpose and need by having some voluntary sessions in local charity foundation, you do not have to work there full time or start up your own.<br><br>That's my add to this soul searching business. And if it goes about Pavlina soul searching, I think he finished quite nasty with LOA and PUPA stuff.</div>

<div class="content">Excellent cautionary tale, Navigare.  The pursuit of passion should be fun and an opportunity.  Don't get carried away by this pursuit. If it becomes a burden, you've missed the mark.  And right-on that you need not make a career out of passions.</div>

<div class="content">@Laurence,<br><br>Thank you for Manifesto, some points resonate with me fairly well. But my point in being pro, was not making money from art (as this seems pejorative term) but living from art. So I don't have to work full time in odd, closed path career to pay my bills. Anyway this is past for me and I don't think am gonna come back to music as artist any time soon.</div>

<div class="content">@Navigare<br><br>The role of conductor is very important and composers need people like you active in the field (and miss those who leave it).<br><br>The passion is in the music, not in the conductor. As Blake said "To be in a passion you good may do, But no good if a passion is in you."<br><br>So if conducting is what you are here to do, no force can stop you. If it's not, no force can make you.<br><br>Re Manifesto VI, "Do not sell your work." This applies to artists specifically. So in your field, you might have come across professional musicians who rehearse less avidly than the amateur, for example, or cases where performance schedules are rushed at the cost of the quality of the performance. Professional usually means "for money", but in the context of art, it refers to an attitude of reliability and consistency, without drama.<br><br>But once an artist always an artist, so if not in music I imagine you will find expression in something else.</div>
