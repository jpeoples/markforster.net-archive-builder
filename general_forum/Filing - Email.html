<div class="content">Hi Mark and anyone who can help!<br><br>I am overwhelmed by email - I have zillions of folders etc<br><br>Some people recommend having only a few folders - including an 'archive' folder where they put old emails and current emails that may be needed in the future.<br><br>I am tempted to put all emails into an 'archive' folder but don't know whether it is practical or not? And how would i find things?<br><br>Any advice would be really appreciated from anyone who is on top of how they store their email<br><br>Many thanks</div>

<div class="content">Nick,<br><br>I can't speak to lots of email, but what has worked best for me is to use "rules" and "tags" in my mail client.  This handles the mail that I know generally what I'm going to do about it.  "If it is from X, put it here and sound an alarm", kind of thing.  Tagging has reduced the clutter of folders.  Have a look at Taglocity -- using it has reduced the clutter of email folders.  I can search by tags to find anything I need from one big archive folder.  Having fewer folders helps cut down on distraction.<br><br>BTW, tagging (and later searching) and sorting in advance are two very different concepts for managing files ... your mind will probably like one and reject the other, but give tagging a try at least.  Done well, you can have items effectively "filed" in many places simultaneously with no redundancy.</div>

<div class="content">Nick:<br><br>The best way of dealing with email that I know of is the Nelson Email Organiser <a href="http://www.emailorganizer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.emailorganizer.com</a><br><br>This is a brilliant program and I really don't know what I would do without it. It will do all that you mention with ease and a lot more beside.<br><br>It's an Outlook plug-in so you will need to have Outlook (not Outlook Express), but it works with all editions.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hello Nick,<br><br>I can understand your predicament. I've moved from having multiples nested folders to a much simpler approach at work:<br>- a folder for all email related to tasks in AF, until they are completed and moved (see below)<br>- a folder for my team HR stuff<br>- a folder for my admin, training, etc<br><br>and then an archive for ALL work email, including those from AF tasks above, one created for each quarter year e.g. now I'm using 2009_Q1. Into this goes all Sent and In mail - with no subfolders.<br><br>IF you ever actually need to seach (and it's probably rarer than you think), then Outlook's sort and search functions are quick and easy. THis approach enabled me to manage 18000+ emails in 2008 - and my inbox is empty thanks to AF and its predecessors.<br><br>There's a great video and marterials on handling email at <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero" rel="nofollow">http://www.43folders.com/izero</a> , which will help, the prcinciples of which can support Mark's work here.<br><br>Good luck!<br></div>

<div class="content">Nick<br><br>I too would recommend NEO (Nelson Email Organiser) - I've used it for years and know that if I need to find an email from any period I can find it within seconds.</div>

<div class="content">Mark et al<br><br>Many thanks indeed for your suggestions. Sorry forgot to mention that I use Mozilla Thunderbird at work. <br><br>But NEO looks amazing (I used to use Outlook at work in the past) hope this helps others who use Outlook.<br><br>Thanks Mike for your tips regarding tags - I have been thinking about them but will have to read up on it!<br><br>Thanks Jonathan re organising folders - and for the link on 43folders.com.<br><br>Regards</div>
