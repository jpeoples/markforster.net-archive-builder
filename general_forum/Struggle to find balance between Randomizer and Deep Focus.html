<div class="content">With all the AF-style list systems (AF, DWM, FV, now Randomizer), I find myself getting into a zone, where I go very quickly through many many small tasks.   And it's so much fun!    And I agree with so many who have found that the Randomizer is the most fun of all!<br><br>The problem for me is that it's so much fun, I don't want to slow down whenever I hit a task that might actually take some time and thought to tackle.   It breaks the fast-flowing joy of banging out all those tasks that have been lying around, the dopamine rush of crossing out all those tasks!<br><br>And so, I have the same issue I've had with AF1 and other systems - there's a tendency to get all kinds of trivia and miscellany completed, but not make as much progress on the harder stuff.<br><br>Ideally, the trivia and miscellany would only consume a small percentage of my day, and then I'd be DONE and able to focus the rest of my time on the bigger things.  But in periods of high thrash, it seems there's an unending stream of trivia, and it's just SO MUCH FUN to go back to being an Inbox Ninja and whacking down all those tasks.<br><br>It's not so much fun, though, at the end of the week when the major projects haven't made as much progress as they should.<br><br>It's not simply a matter of overcommitment.   If I were in my right mind, I'd ignore at least half of the incoming miscellany and spend more time on the major projects, and I'd be a lot happier with the results.   I want to find a way to structure things so I don't have to rely on willpower and force and time-boxing to make it happen (I've never been very good at brute force).<br><br>I have my personal kanban board, which reminds me of the major commitments and deadlines - this is helpful, and it's a fun way to see everything happening - but not nearly as fun as using Randomizer!   :-)<br><br>Maybe I just need to spend a little more time breaking down the major deliverables into tasks, and putting those tasks in the Randomizer, and letting it hammer them till done.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I'm really interested in your feedback here, especially in light of your recent comment:<br><br><<  I find [Randomizer] works best with larger tasks than I use with normal AF or FV. So rather than have a lot of small items, I tend to combine them. >><br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html#comment20765603" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html#comment20765603</a></div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br>"And so, I have the same issue I've had with AF1 and other systems - there's a tendency to get all kinds of trivia and miscellany completed, but not make as much progress on the harder stuff."<br><br>I don't have this problem at all. Quite the opposite. Because the tasks are picked at random, the trivia gets picked much less often than with other methods of working the list. There is a nice mix of easy and difficult, trivial and important.<br><br>For example, with old AF1, I would do "email" and rewrite it at the end of the list. Then I would do "email" again when I reached the end of the list. Rewrite, do again. I could do it, legally and according to the rules, several times a day. Mix that in with "read blogs", "read this", "read that", "check calendar", "read Mark Forster forum", "twitter", "facebook", and so on, and my whole day could be taken up doing these things (legally and according to the rules). On average I probably spent 80% (or more) of my work day on trivia and 20% on the important. <br><br>With Random AF1, I reckon I spend at least 80% of my work day on the important stuff, and very little on trivia. I might only do "email" once a day. Same for everything else. So I spend more time on it knowing that I will probably not visit it again today. But that longer time is far less than all the little visits added together, and there is far less chance I will be distracted.<br><br>Consequently, for as long as this wonderfulness lasts, the meaningful and satisfying parts of my life have become 4 times longer! <br><br>Regarding the fun aspect: I agree, it is a lot of fun, and it is easy to get carried away with crossing off frequently. However, I get the most joy and satisfaction out of completing the meaningful things. It wasn't that way at first, but it developed once the list shrank down and the nature of the tasks changed after a couple of weeks of using Random AF1.</div>

<div class="content">I'm having the same feeling as Seraphim.  For me, the random method creates huge momentum that is quite addictive.  More than once I get on a roll (no pun intended) and think I'm becoming a workaholic.  The difficulty for me has been that when I hit a task that is longer or more difficult or requires more concentration, I'm having difficulty settling down to do it.  The temptation is for me with "little and often" to just work on it for a bit and then move on because I don't want to break the momentum. I'm going to try applying the pomodoro technique with this with the following rule:  I will spend at least one pomodoro (25 minutes) on each task unless (a) I don't have 25 minutes (e.g. I have 15 minutes between meetings and I'm sitting at my desk) or (b) I actually complete the task before the end of the pomodoro (for obvious reasons). But maybe that's adding too much structure to an amazing system and I should just do my work.</div>

<div class="content">I start each count on my day list. That's working well so far. There are enough big projects on it to balance the trivial. Today I have too many 2-step projects falling behind, so I have an extra line that tells me to do the oldest. (New computer, so install this software [check it's still the bets choice; cross house to get purse to get credit card] to do that 5-minute task. Chain of move last year's active files to old cabinet, and those files to archives or garbage.)<br><br>If most of the lines on your list are small, then most of the rolls will give you one.<br><br>Listing tasks rather than projects increases the number of lines for a project. (If I land on step 2, I do step 1 instead.) You can also give the project stars and tap once per star. (Tried that with other systems; spent more time fine-tuning the star count than working. The correct number of stars varied with my current worries.)<br><br>State before you roll what type you're looking for (or won't accept). It could be time or focus required, or which part of your job. Then slide until you hit one that fits.<br><br>Maybe do no more than 5 mosquitoes in a row.<br><br>Maybe a separate list (don't like it already) of mosquito tasks, and a single line in the big list labeled "mosquitoes".</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>I hate to keep quoting from DIT, but the whole thing is wrapped around commitment vs interest.<br><br>Maybe you might want to read <a href="../general_forum/Mixing DIT and randomizer.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2290127</a><br><br>There are many ideas about how to make sure that your MITs are progressed today. Hint: I write how much I want to progress or finish it.  If it's a project with unknowns I'll use time. Example: Start Painting A due XX-XX > or = to 2 hours.  That way I have the freedom of experimentation and discovery.  Usually a basic idea begins to gel. Heck, I might even get jump started and find myself in flow.  Since it's an MIT, I'm golden.<br><br>If I also have an MIT that's boring, I might START that so that if I do get into flow, I don't have to worry if it's 2 hours or 10 hours.<br><br>Veghead Jones alternates his MIT list with his regular list.  I try to stay in my MIT mindset as long as I can.  I think of the other list as purely a relief mechanism until the MIT's are done according to how I defined finished for today.  IOW, I segregate the lists but I always have one or two wildcards to create willingness to approach the MIT list.  When I hit a wildcard, it's my choice.  I can start another MIT, continue on a MIT started or do like Veghead Jones.  The difference is that I use a timer to put definite edges on using the regular list if my MITs aren't completed.  If I get in a flow pattern with an MIT, I give myself the freedom to just go with it.  I can't allow that with the regular list simply because I might stay in that list too long if I'm resisting an MIT.  After my MITs are done for today, I can play the game with the other list for as long as I like.<br>Hint: I keep my appointments and MITs segregated at the top of today's page so that they are always in my face.  Since I time my efforts and keep a log, I'm seeing the MITs quite frequently. <br><br>If you set a time limit for the regular list, you'll be assured of it not stealing your day.  I also try to keep my MIT's at 4 hours or less when I can.  That allows me the freedom to either work on the MITs longer or play around with the regular list.  Win-Win.  <br><br>REMEMBER that your main goal is to complete the MITs you chose for yourself. Until they are completed to your satisfaction for today, the function of using the other list is to provide temporary relief from headbanging MITs and to keep your momentum up for working. Use whatever work arounds you need to complete your MITs.  I use time boundaries for the relief tasks ESPECIALLY if I'm feeling high resistance toward an MIT or two. Otherwise, I'd trick my mind into staying on that list while feeling the shame of avoiding what I set out to do.  When I do that, it's easy to right myself again.  Remember, I always have at least one wildcard one the MIT list to create willingness to approach it.  Whether I ever draw the wildcard is immaterial.  It's a device to create willingness via the hope of temporarily escaping the dreaded task(s).  It's all a game to help myself complete my MITs.  There are other great suggestions in that post also. My way is more restricted because I know myself.  LOL!</div>

Part of me is still convinced there's time to do everything of mid-importance for the day and above, so it doesn't matter if I do the mid-importance things first. That part is wrong, but oh so tempting to listen to. I admire your ability to ignore it.</div>

<div class="content">To illustrate how random selection of tasks helps to get the real work done: tonight I was procrastinating on some household chores: changing the bed sheets, folding laundry. I started working the list, and the first task that came up was to watch a youtube video that someone had recommended a while back. It had stuck on my list because I didn't want to do fun stuff while there was still so much real work to do (but a lot of the real work l didn't get done either :-).<br><br>So I watched the video, then counted a random number to the next task, which was again a youtube video. Hm. I watched that video, then decided that I could just as well change the bed sheets (I passed that task while counting to the 2nd video), and in the process also cleaned up the laundry. In the end, I had done more useful work than I anticipated, and I had fun watching the video's.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>There's nothing wrong with you doing tasks how you see fit.  If you can pull it off, why not.<br><br>I'm disabled.  I have to do what I can when I can. I can't bank on the future allowing me to not have too much pain.  If I could, I'd probably work lighter yet before I was disabled I worked almost like a workaholic.  I also made sure that I took several 3 day vacations and 2 big sports vacations yearly. That's what kept me at it:visualizing the fun to come!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">I realize that my previous comment didn't address the problem that Seraphim and others mentioned, that the momentum of the randomizer list makes it difficult to sit down for the more complicated tasks and really concentrate on them.<br><br>Like Wooba, I don't experience that at all. When a more complicated task is selected by the randomizer, I find it easier than with the other systems to do some meaningful work on it. I think part of the reason is that I know the randomizer may give me an easier or more fun task after working on something difficult, *without feeling guilty* about selecting something fun. With previous systems, I did find it hard to make meaningful progress when doing little and often on a difficult task, because doing a little bit would remind me of how difficult the task was so I wouldn't select it again for a long time. With the randomizer, I don't know how long it will be before the randomizer gives me that same task again, so I might just as well get it over with now.<br><br>Of course this only holds when your list has a nice mix of difficult and easy and boring and fun tasks.<br><br>It may also have something to do with the fact that I'm easily bored. With the previous systems, I would know what's on the list, and know that I didn't feel like doing some of them, and also know what the fun things in between were. That's still the case, but the surprise is what the randomizer will give me today.</div>

<div class="content">Learning, The problem is, I can't pull it off as well as I'd like. I count too much on being able to do things in the future. Yes, I'm more likely to be able work this afternoon than you are, but since I know that, I end up wasting the morning and spending the afternoon on urgent things, rather than morning on urgent things and the afternoon on even more things.<br><br>It's like in (not sure the country, one of them with higher risk thresholds) when they brought in anti-lock brakes for taxis. Accidents went down dramatically, until the drivers got used to them. Within 6 months, they were cutting things even closer, and the accident rate went back to what it was before.<br><br>Nicole, I feel the same. "I don't know how long it will be before the randomizer gives me that same task again, so I might just as well get it over with now." It's silly, because the common sense rule allows us to do it when we need to, but somehow not quite trusting the randomizer to give us a second chance helps.<br><br>I think the randomizer also prevents build-up of tension. I know that the next page has that task I'm dreading! I'll have to decide. Do it or find something else that isn't as worthy of my time right now. What will I decide? I don't want to decide!<br><br>With the randomizer, we can't build that tension over a specific task. Chances are we won't have to deal with that task at all this time round.<br><br>Today I need to focus on mosquitoes, including those for a long slow project with multiple contacts and input. Notes of who to call are scattered throughout my notes and email. If I hit something else, I'll slide (unless I decide before rolling that I need a break). Odds are good I won't slide very far.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket, about counting too much on being able to do things in the future: Mark warns specifically against this, I think in "Do It Tomorrow." It's a real danger, because you feel like you'll be able to do it later, but when later comes you have all these other things that you're also working on taking up all your time. I don't remember Mark's exact advice, but I think it was something like "only schedule for future days if you're absolutely sure you'll have that block of time available then."<br><br>I think you're right about the (prevention of) build up of tension with the randomizer. It's no use agonizing over an upcoming task, because it might not be selected :-). Not having to choose between doing a not-so-fun task or feeling guilty about choosing something less horrible relieves a lot of tension!</div>

<div class="content">Agreed. It's one of those good pieces of advice I have difficulty using. This week I'm trying to start the day with things that need to be done, but not succeeding much. I'm just successful enough to see that it works, but not enough to overcome the resistance to change. It feels pessimistic to only plan on a few things when I know I can do so much more -- if only I focused. Yet getting those things done early sets the tone for the day and I end up doing twice as much.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>I fall off the rails frequently. When I actually realize it, I stop. Think. Then get back on track. That's why I like a simple, dependable system. I'm not saying that doing the work itself is any easier. I'm saying that the day plan filters out a lot of stressful decision making.  If that's not enough, I pull out a work around to help me.<br><br>I've always been highly distractable if my mind is restless/disinterested.  Now I have to contend with short term memory loss on top of that.  YIKES!  When I veer off course, sometimes I don't even realize it.  When I do, I have to stop. Realign my thoughts and get back to it.  There's no shame in getting back on the horse when you fall off.  LOL!  That's why I love the WILL DO list.  It tells me what I need to do to. I like to keep it in my face because it's so easy for me to forget. Also looking at the list helps to remind me why I'm bothering with it in the first place.  Yeah, I need reminding....especially when my mind offers no clues on it's own.  That used to really terrify me.  Now I'm more used to it.<br><br>Cricket, I would suggest that you are probably living a great life and benefiting others as well. I'll bet that you don't fall off the track nearly as much as I do.  It takes effort and determination because my brain doesn't always serve me.  OTOH,  You're willfully choosing what you want to do.  Many people like to start with more pleasant tasks to ease into their day.  My dad always read the paper with a cup of coffee first thing every day.  He didn't have to feel guilty.  It worked for him.  Everybody is different.</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I'm so easily distracted that I can't have leisure items on my list.  The temptation would ruin my efforts.  I have distinct breaks.  When I want to do something optional that might put me into flow, I must not start it until I've finished with my MITs.  I know myself: my strengths and my weaknesses.  Instead of shaming myself with thinking it's a character flaw (how I was taught to believe), I think of it as a trait. Not bad or good in itself, just contextually helpful or not.  Flow is great when it serves me.  That same hyperfocus can be a real beast when I'm entranced with nonsense when I need to work.  LOL!  Eh, no worries.  When I was younger I was called the methodical bohemian.  LOL!  Now I realize that I needed to be far more methodical to make up for my quirky brain.  I also realize that I always kept myself loaded with jobs because I feared boredom.  You're probably far more normal than I ever was!  <br><br>Overall, I'm doing OK "faults" and all.  I've had a lifetime of high distractability and hyperfocus and did OK anyway.  We don't need to be perfect. As long as we do the work, who really cares how we pull it off, yeah?  LOL!</div>
