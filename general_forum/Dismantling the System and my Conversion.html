<div class="content">First of all, I must say that GTD saved my life and helped me track much more than I would have been able to- had I not had a system. Now, I am excited to implement DIT due to its simplicity and focus on action. It has been well documented on this forum, but GTD may not be for me because I tended to use the system to procrastinate, here at least with DIT I am taking baby steps towards initiatives.<br><br>Even before DIT I had broken my contexts down to Errands, Office, and Home just because I would rarely use any of the others that DA proposes. The system was too complicated. I like the idea of going even simpler.<br><br>So here I go trying to implement DIT while carefully dismantling the GTD System I created. I sincerely would appreciate any advice from users of DIT to let me know if I am on target. Note, I have not read the book yet. I tried to buy it last week, and I found it wasn’t available in the US until November. I have it coming soon from a library from another state.<br><br>My first step feels like moving projects to my Someday/Maybe list that aren’t truly Current Initiatives. This will allow me to redefine “Projects” to a Current Initiateves list which I can work off, “one at a time”. My next actions and SDMB list will be worked off of as a backlog until I get current.<br><br>I like the idea of trimming the SDMB list and cleaning it up because I am sick of the “overhead costs” that my GTD system requires.<br><br>So let me get this straight:<br>Each night I will create my closed list for the next day (in my case based off of current Next Actions and my Current Initiative) and put a rule line at the bottom. Creating these closed lists from the previous days input and backlog.<br><br>I think that should do it, does this sound correct to DIT users?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Erik<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik,<br><br>My view is you neither need to dismantle your GTD system nor surrender the gains that you reaped as a consequence of it.<br><br>Your summary of DIT seems accurate to me. Make a list of things to do tomorrow and put a line under it. <br><br>I waited more than a month to get a copy of the book from amazon.com. Subsequently, I have read here numerous times that Mark Forster recommends that you go to the amazon site but buy it from sellers other than amazon in order to receive it sooner.<br><br>There is no substitute for the book. I reread it all the time.<br><br>Good luck,<br><br>moises</div>
