<div class="content">Though I'm using paper for my personal list (a very portable pocket size Moleskin cahier) I'm currently trying a Google spreadsheet for my work list. As a software developer my working life is heavily computer-centric so this suits my workflow.<br><br>Has anyone else tried the spreadsheet route? <br><br>For me, a spreadsheet has more of the flexibility and immediacy of paper than other digital solutions and has the powerful advantage over paper of easy copy and paste and input by typing (I can type much faster than I can write neatly). <br><br>For example for the task 'check out this web article' I can paste the URL into the task notes column and then click on it to open the link when doing the task. It's also reasonably easy to view/filter and edit from the iPhone web browser. Doesn't yet support offline access via Gears but I wouldn't be surprised if it soon does.<br><br>Currently I have each 'page' on a separate sheet with a single character status column for started/in progress/dismissed/finished which is automatically coloured making it easy to spot the unprocessed tasks. It's easy to add extra columns as needed (e.g. notes), copy and paste items, sort tasks, print out, import, export, share with other people etc. Creating new empty 'pages' is a matter of duplicating an active sheet and deleting the existing items. I usually name the sheet with its date and time.<br><br>The main limitation with a Google spreadsheet is that rewriting an item at the end of the list requires a copy and paste as there are no macros. The easiest way to deal with this is to have one browser tab for the current 'page' and a separate browser tab for the last 'page'.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Based on my personal experience, I would start with a notebook in paper form. I used a spreadsheet system with GTD and I think part of the reason why I wasn't very successful with that system was the fact that I relied on various digital solutions for it, including using a spreadsheet.<br><br>A spreadsheet has all the advantages and benefits that you mention, but it also has a serious drawback: It distracts one from actually doing the tasks into trying to perfect the system. Moreover, if you print your spreadsheet in order to use the paper list as a working list, then every update you do to the list during the day must also be entered in the spreadsheet in order to update that one too. I find that there is a break in continuity. In any case, looking at a list of tasks on a monitor is not as inspiring as looking at it in hard copy format.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Otto,<br><br>I did start with a notebook which was OK (and I'll return to it if my digital experiment is a failure). However I found myself frequently rewriting incoming digital information with pen and paper and then having to look up relevant digital information before I could actually do a task. This inefficiency made me resist using the system (in my heavily computer based work flow there was a break in continuity in the opposite direction).<br><br>I definitely agree about the dangers of permanently tweaking the system but it has now settled down and just works so I've stopped modifying it. I haven't yet needed to print my list out. I carry a notebook for scribbling and doodling which occasionally captures new items which need re-entry but not enough to be a problem.<br><br>You make a very interesting point about a paper list being more inspiring than a digital list. I wonder why that is. I'll be comparing my experiences of a paper personal AF list and a digital AF work list to see if the same is true for me.<br><br>So far I have noticed that I'm more resistant to looking at a fixed digital todo list system than a relatively free-form spreadsheet. My urge to rebel against the system is reduced when I have the freedom to scribble and add more information as I see fit without jumping through any hoops or conforming to the software's 'rules'.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I note you mentioned a Google spreadsheet so are probably not using MS Office, but if you do have it, have you considered using OneNote?  It gives the flexibility of a notepad with the ability to add and edit easily, as well as extract subset data and link to Outlook if required.<br><br>However I firmly believe the paper route is the best - it feels more intuitive than a screen somehow.  I consider my paper notebook as my AF system, with OneNote more as an add-on for additional data management.</div>
