<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-2 10:45</div>
<div class="content">I'd just like a bit of guidance on the use of words like "calendar" and "diary" in US English.<br><br>In UK English a "calendar" is something which you hang on your wall with the days of the month represented in a box shape. It often has a pretty picture for each month. There may be a small space provided to write events in, but it is the representation of the month in diagrammatic form that is the focus. Another use of the word is for things like the "church calendar" which shows when the major feasts of the year are.<br><br>In UK English the word "diary" has two main meanings:<br><br>1) A book in which you write about your life day by day. The most famous example is Samuel Pepys's diary.<br><br>2) A book in which you put all your appointments etc for the coming year, e.g. "unsold 2010 diaries are now selling at half-price". This is the sense I have been using "diary" in the instructions for DIT2/AF5.<br><br>Other words with similar meanings would include "journal" for diary sense 1 and "schedule" which is a detailed breakdown of a short period or particular subject, e.g. "my schedule for today" or "the conference schedule" or "my schedule of seminars".<br><br>How does US English use of these words compare? I'm asking so that the final version of the instructions is comprehensible to both sides of the pond (not to mention the rest of the world)!</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Mark,<br><br>The place where you record appointments is:<br><br>- Calendar (most common)<br>- Schedule (which more often refers to the day itself)<br>- Agenda<br>- Daybook (a bit more rare)<br>- Daytimer (a brand but often used for a portable schedule book)<br><br>Where you write events passing:<br><br>- Journal (most common and very much preferred by men)<br>- Diary (has the sense of something used by women and little girls)</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, I also meant to add that the term "diary" used as a place to record appointments seems VERY odd to the US ear.  People who have less exposure to English spoken outside of the US would not have a clue what you meant.  Putting it even more bluntly, it sounds "prissy" to the US ear.</div>

<div class="content">In the U.S. "diary" is used primarily for the first defintion - "a book in which you write about your life day-to-day". For the second definition - "A book in which you put all your appointments etc for the coming year" we use the term "planner".<br><br>I believe "journal" and "calendar" are used the same in the UK and US.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Donna,<br><br>Fascinating.  I would not think to call an "appointment book" (yet another term, Mark, but this one has the sense of something used in a nail salon to record appointments for customers) a "planner".  Do you think that this usage is more likely to be heard from those who use their book to "plan their life".  IOW, for goals and such.  In business I have not heard that usage.  Planning is done in meetings or on spreadsheets (if financial) or on paper tacked all over the walls ;-)<br><br>I think that "planner" would be understood as Mark means "diary" but only by a specific subset of the culture.  Now that I think about it, the term "day planner" would be more similarly understood.</div>

<div class="content"><<People who have less exposure to English spoken outside of the US would not have a clue what you meant. >><br><br>I don't agree - I do a lot of training and many of my delegates speak English but are not from the UK - most often they speak with UK English roots.  It really depends on where they have come from.  Most from the Indian continent have a UK based English. I would have said that many European countries have a US based English (mainly gleaned from films and music) however many large global businesses like Shell use UK based English and spellings.<br><br>I think the trick is Mark to try and find something generic that all can understand - it probably doesn't really matter if it sounds a bit 'prissy' to some as long as they understand what you mean.  I think the term 'dated planner' probably is widely understood.</div>

"Book" is heavily dependent on context so it is probably not what Mark wants to use.  A "book" is also what a salesman writes his orders in.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for a fascinating discussion so far. I'm still searching for a satisfactory word which will mean "a book with blank dated pages and lots of space for each day" to both an American and a Brit.<br><br>So far "Daily Planner" seems about the best, but I don't think it's perfect.<br><br>Any other suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">If you look at other time/task management systems or software, daily events go on a "Calendar."  Microsoft Outlook has a "Calendar", not a "diary" or "planner".  In GTD, David Allen recommends day-specific actions/appointments go on your "Calendar."  Those are probably the more popular representations in the U.S., in my opinion.<br><br>In another discussion, I alluded to the difficulty in finding a "page-a-day diary" available in the U.S. that wasn't visually disrupted by pre-printed time-slots for appointments.  It's just not as common here in the U.S. (no wonder many Americans can't manage tasks properly).<br><br>I wouldn't necessarily try to satisfy all of the American English variants, but address the population of people that are coming over from other time management methods.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  Include a photo of your diary opened to a set of blank pages to convey what you mean by diary.<br><br>My sister might right in her "diary" before going to sleep.  Not me. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">In my side of the world, we tend to take "diary" to mean the "one day per page yearly diary" or "one week on facing pages yearly diary". In fact most of the ones sold in the shops are printed with labels like "2010 diary". <br><br>It is also common for us to have "one day per page yearly calendar, with room for some notes on each page". The difference to us is "calendar" will be displayed on the wall, whereas "diary" would be a book on the desk or in the pocket.<br><br>Historically, Malaysians have been using UK-based English, but we are slowly getting Americanized in our English usage.<br><br>Mmm ... Could Mark just use the full name "one page per day diary" at least once at the start of the description, and continue with the short name "diary" thereafter?</div>

I don't say I am adding them to my planner. At home my planner contains both my calendar and my to do list (now my Autofocus list). At work we use outlook and don't have paper calendars. At work I use a spreadsheet for my Autofocus/to do list.<br><br>So planner may not be the exact term like diary is but I can't think of anything closer.  I think calendar may have too many connotations associated with it. But I probably could get used to either term - planner or calendar.</div>

<div class="content">I work for a Fortune 5 company. Calendar is the word that used to describe the place where you place appointments. <br><br>The use of any other word from an American, Indian, Latin American, Brit, European, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc. would sound odd. But our organization is dedicated to Outlook.<br><br>More generically, the world used to described one's availability in general is "schedule". "Let me check my schedule." If you are a thirteen-year-old girl or a pompous executive, you would use "schedj".</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>In the Fortune 500 world "agenda" means: a list of items to be discussed at a meeting.  The second meaning that you give "a plan of one's own likely to be in conflict with others" is also very common but a different term entirely.  I would suspect that in a Fortune 500 company you could hear: "He put this item on the agenda for today's meeting so he must have a hidden agenda".  It can easily be seen how the second meaning derived from the first.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>One final thought on this.  America is not one place, linguistically.  I know that GB is not either, but I suspect that the regional variations are wider here.  At least in GB you have RP which, I take it, most citizens would understand, if not speak.  Here someone from Arkansas would likely hear someone from Michigan talking and call him a "damm ferner".<br><br>There is also a second layer of variation ... those who are into time management and those not.  While I stand by my statements about some of the terms not being well understood in the way you might mean, that is from the perspective of the general population.  How many in the general population plan anything but the next day's TV watching schedule?  So those are probably not the people you care to reach.<br><br>I concur with the suggestion that you show a book opened to blank pages and call it what you will, preferably "calendar" for us here in the US.  I suggest "calendar" for the reasons I've given but even more because the KEY point is that it be dated.  My planner actually has no dates, it is a ruled notebook ;-)  <br><br>I also concur with the suggestion that the first time you use the term you make it descriptive:<br><br>"For my list I use a book that has one page per day with the dates on each page.  Mine has no time slots for appointments because this book is NOT intended to be a place to write upcoming appointments.  If you are shopping for something suitable in the UK, I am using (model #,see picture above) but you may find a different form factor more suitable.  In the UK you could search for ("diary" or whatever) while in the US you can search for ("calendar" or "planner" or whatever conclusion you have drawn from your input here ;-).  You could also simply write the date on the top of each page of any blank book of convenient format."  Etc. <br><br>I imagine written like that (assuming there are no legal ramifications with showing a picture of your book or mentioning a specific manufacturer) it would be hard for anyone to misunderstand your intention.</div>

<div class="content">I have been a diary/journal keeper since I was 9 or so (still have them...they are a blast to read). If one says "I keep a journal" today, I would interpret that as a big-girl version of the diary-a place to write about one's more personal experiences, etc. I would not consider it in a business sense at all.<br><br>While I have used such a thing as a daily thingy for business/to-do/etc, I am not sure there is any Universally recognized term in the U.S. for what you are seeking here, Mark.

<div class="content">I haven't noticed any Australians commenting. I know that's not what you asked for Mark, but I'm feeling the need to speak! <br><br>Here, we call the books you are talking about, diaries. I have often read online of Americans saying they take their calendar with them when they go out; I honestly thought they took the big thing with pictures of Tuscany off the wall, put it in a shopping bag, and went out. I couldn't bring myself to follow suit, despite the advice I read to do so.

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>The US is a huge countries with quite diverse subcultures!  Even I have to ask what they mean when they use a word in a context I'm not familiar with.  It's even worse for translating idioms and slang!  I wouldn't worry so much about the best US words to use because it's highly unlikely to be universally used!  LOL!

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>I wonder why Stweie's head is shaped like an American Football (or is it meant to be refer to something else entirely?) yet he speaks like Rex Harrison acting on a broadway stage!  Another oddity is watching those old 30's to 50's movies with those stylized accents that Americans tried to emmulate when they were putting on airs!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>As I understand it, among "traditional" actors (not the new acting school that turns out "characters" that are the same no matter what the role) the accent they learn is a kind of middle of the road British accent.  It is considered to be the most easily understood and clear in enunciation.  At least that is what I've heard.</div>

<div class="content">Chiming in late here, but I'm surprised nobody has suggested (on a quick scan, anyway) the specific combination "appointments diary". It's in common usage in the US, it makes sense to UK ears, it distinguishes one kind of diary from the others, and even if you've never heard it, it's surely hard to misunderstand what's being talked about.</div>

<div class="content">ludlow:<br><br>Thanks for the suggestion. So in this case, "diary" would have a different connotation to American ears?<br><br>The only problem with "appointments diary" is that, to my ears anyway, I would expect it to have times of day printed in.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I think "appointments diary" would prevent Americans — the ones I know and work among, anyway — confusing it with "journal".<br><br>As for your point about listed times: I guess that links to the other confusion I'm seeing on these threads, where some people are getting confused because they think of a diary (or a calendar, or whatever they call it) as a thing that lists items that must be done on that specific day. Maybe you could kill two birds with one stone by coming up with some generic phrase like "a notebook with dated pages", then explaining, briefly, that obviously a diary or appointments book could be used, though not in the normal way...<br><br>(OK, OK, I admit that I haven't tried the system yet. But I will and when I do I think I'll just use another of my notebooks, with a date written in at the top of each page.)</div>
