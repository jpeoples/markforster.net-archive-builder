<div class="content">Warning: I haven't yet been entirely successful with this idea. I'm presenting it for the crowd to consider, suggest improvements, or explain why it shouldn't work. <br><br>The idea is to examine tasks you feel you should do but aren't. Maybe it's about to be dismissed. Seems to me there are three cases. <br>1.  It's part of something bigger but this part isn't ready yet. Solution: Scale it Up to the bigger task and start figuring how to work on that. <br>2. It's too big and you aren't grabbed because of its size. Solution: Scale it Down.  Pick a part of the task that you are ready to do.<br>3. You really don't need this. Throw it Out.</div>

<div class="content">4. It's not your own goal, but someone else's goal. Are you aware that it's not your goal? Do you want to support it? Solution: Be loyal or 'sharpen your sword'.</div>

<div class="content">That particular one never comes up for me.  Anyway, I'm hoping to focus more on the idea of solving a stuck task by either going up to a higher or down to a lower level statement of the task at hand.<br><br>Another possibility is to go Forward.  If you aren't ready for N, think if there's a K that precedes it and rewrite the N into K.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan<br><br>I think you are on to something.<br>We all know the fact that some things don't move because they are not well defined. Most of the time, I try to define it more granularly. But you raised the interesting point that when it's not something you can move on now, then going up might help!<br><br>I will definitely be trying this!!!</div>

<div class="content">I think this is also a very valuable way to think about task.  I frequently reduce down, but the idea of scaling up and connecting to a bigger goal seems very valuable as well.  Thanks for posting this.</div>
