<div class="content">One of the tricks of AUtofocus is to add tasks about your list. One of the tricks of the SuperFocus generation is you can do these urgently rather than later. (Although maybe that's a downfall.). Anyway, if the system isn't suiting you, add a task to fix it. <br><br>How do I feel?<br>Is there something I'm neglecting?<br>Take a break<br>Review day<br>Think about afternoon. <br>Anything In that questions thread<br><br>I imagine there's some things That deserve a regular role....</div>

<div class="content">Great topic to explore, Alan. I've always thought there was a lot of untapped potential in these meta-items. The trick is discovering them, and then remembering to use them, without effectively creating a bunch of new rules for ourselves.</div>
