<div class="content">HI All !<br><br>First best wishes for you and to yours family. Best wishes to this forum and especially to you Mark health and all you can swear. <br><br>For myself I have a little swear. As you know English is not my native language. And we are many on this forum which is international. I love reading it but I noticed it takes a long time to read it. If everyone could write shortly, essentially and clearly it would be easier to read and faster.I will try to do the same and I know it is quiet un easy.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster is the master of succinctness, and his comments cut to the heart of the issue at hand.   When I am in a hurry, I just scan for Mark's postings.  If they catch my interest, I scan backwards to see what the discussion is all about.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Jupiter et al for good wishes. Small note to Jupiter: I'm not understanding 'swear'. (what French word did you mean?). In English swear means either 'curse' or 'oath' as in public Commitment.<br><br>Anyway, I wish for everyone a year so successful that tinkering is merely for fun not need. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thank you to all for your wishes, and facinating discussion. I wish you all a healthy, organised, and happy year 2012. <br>Alan, I think Jupiter meant "wish", at least this is how I understand it as a french native speaker.<br>I should add that I subscribe to this wish : I sometimes regret not to have time to read passionate and interesting posts, just because they are too long. <br>May Time become our best friend !</div>
