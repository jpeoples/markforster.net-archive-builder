<div class="content">One of the things that got me hooked on GTD at first was the idea that I could "widgetize" my work, doing all my thinking up front and just plowing through a pre-decided bunch of simple steps to get things done. Unfortunately, the fabled widgets never really materialized, no matter how much I tried. My work *is* thinking, and I find that I change my mind all the time about what to do with a particular project or goal and that I need to digest and incubate ideas and inputs before figuring out what the next step is. Autofocus is different and effective because it can contend with both my mental processes and the constantly changing nature of my work. It's flexible and iterative, and since I do it by hand, on paper, it's fast and responsive enough to capture my thinking and make it useful.<br><br>/just thinking about why AF works</div>

<div class="content">Jennifer:<br><br>I agree. When I think about all the things that I regard as definite achievements in my life, there are very few which were the result of a definite goal and even less that were the result of following a pre-defined plan. It's been much more a case of setting off in the right general direction and taking it from there. One's goals grow and develop as opportunities present themselves. AF lends itself brilliantly to this approach.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jennifer<br><br>I have always found that, whilst I love systems and defining my goals, the next stage planning has frequently changed, and whilst that is a natural part of project progression I suspect a lot of it was a diversionary or procrastinatory pattern.  With AF my project management (outside of AF but managed by AF) is becoming naturally more streamlined.<br><br>I love the term "widgetized" :-)  <br></div>

<div class="content">This reminds me of a great talk by Steve Jobs addressing Stanford graduates.  One of the things which struck me most was this quote below:<br><br>"Of course, it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward.  You can only connect them looking backward, so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."</div>

<div class="content">In GTD's defence, I think David Allen's emphasis has always been on coming up with "a" specific doable next action, to get the ball rolling, rather than doing ALL of your thinking upfront. It gives you a "bookmark", somewhere to pick up the project from, and then when you move on to some other project, you add a new bookmark to your list, so you know where to pick things up from next time. <br><br>I think Allen had a stroke of genius - or a realisation of the blindingly obvious, he'd probably say - when he noted that huge numbers of things on our to-do lists don't get done because they are not physically doable next actions. This is an absolutely correct diagnosis of the problem. But what I hadn't realised until trying Autofocus is that his solution to that problem - to make everything on your list into a specific physically doable next action - is only ONE possible solution. Another solution is to structure the system so that, eventually, you're forced to elicit a next action from every item on the list. AF forces you to do that. And it's more efficient than GTD, because it doesn't make you go through the tiresome process of eliciting a next action in those cases where the next action is obvious.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Ludlow.  While some of my projects and tasks are easy to work on, regardless of how they are written down, some require breaking down into next action to jump the resistance barrier.  If I have a lot of resistance to a task on my autofocus list, it is usually either one which has a lot of emotions involved (I am so stupid, can't believe I missed that meeting, and now I have to fix my mistake) or has a poorly identified next task.  I guess, I can figure out the next task in my head for most things, but some things require the formal process.<br><br>Needless to say, I think Autofocus works well to help work through this, by letting you review tasks repeatedly, and accepting progress in tiny increments if necessary.</div>
