<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-31 2:10</div>
<div class="content">Every now and then, someone complains that they can't figure out how to navigate this forum and find recent posts they haven't already read.<br><br>Here is a method that works for me<br><br>(1) When I want to read the AF forum, I open the main forum page.  I look at the date and time of the most recent post.  I write that down on a sheet of paper (I use a large sticky on the last page of my AF book).<br><br>(2) I look for all the discussions whose date-stamp is newer than the date/time when I last visited the forum.  I use Firefox as my browser, and control-click to open each of those newly-updated discussions quickly in a new tab.  Then, when I look at each discussion, I scroll down to the end, then page back up till I hit the new posts.  Since I know the date/time when I last visited the forum, it's easy to find the posts I haven't read yet.<br><br><br>Anyone else have a better method?</div>

<div class="content">I do the same thing with Firefox (except I middle click).  Having the posts I want to read already opened in separate tabs makes it easy.<br><br>But to avoid reading the same things day after day to figure out what I have already read, I only read posts with the latest post dated yesterday.  Being in the US, by the time I look at the forum in the evening, there are already posts dated tomorrow, like this one.<br><br>Who knows what prompted me to read this today instead of 2 days from now!  The only other time I did that recently was when Mark announce the new switching method.<br><br>By reading only posts with a last update of yesterday, it is easy to find the last thing I read by looking backwards to a gap in the dates.  Often I read from start to finish or for those really long ones, it ends up being about the last half since the first half is often very old.<br><br>Doing it this way means I am a little behind, but I am spending 1/4 to 1/3 the time I had been trying to keep up.  Nothing to write down either.</div>

<div class="content">I just go to the main Discussion Forum page, open the top thread, go to the end and go up the page until I come to a post I haven't read and then read everything after it.<br><br>Then I go back to the main page (using the back button) and repeat the process with the next thread.<br><br>And so on until I reach a thread where I've read all the posts.</div>

<div class="content">If you're on Firefox just use the SiteDelta add-on, which can highlight any changes on the page being visited.<br><br>Works like a charm for me :)</div>

<div class="content">Like Mark, I open each post in sequence, until I get to a post with a last posted timebefore my last visit.<br><br>Tiny point: I use the "End" shortcut to get to the last reply rather than scrolling. For some reason I use the "home" shortcut and then click on  "discussion forum" rather than clicking on the back button on the browser. Or just hitting backspace (I use google chrome).</div>

<div class="content">@Stefano: <br>Many thanks for the suggestion about SiteDelta - I'm one of those who struggle with this rather non-standard internet forum layout, and tend to give up on the discussions from time to time if I don't have the time or inclination to try to recall where I last was with the forum.<br><br>As someone that writes computer software professionally, I tend to have the view that if any piece of software makes you do unnecessary mental work in order to use it (like remembering the last time you visited the forum) then something needs fixing somewhere. Computer software is supposed to make life easier not harder, isn't it? :)<br><br>In any case, this addon makes the discussions MUCH easier to follow. Nice one!</div>

<div class="content">I use always alt+left for back and alt+right for forward (in Firefox), but I justed tested it and backspace works too (shift+backspace is forward, btw).</div>

<div class="content">For example I don't take part in the Ning Autofocus group - not because I have anything against it - but because I've never been able to work out how to access the discussions in it - or indeed whether there are any discussions in it.</div>

<div class="content">It's true that most forums are more cluttered than this one. But there is one functionality which is really gold: most forums can save a cookie on your computer and when you come back, they highlight all new posts since your last visit. But SiteDelta offers exactly that for your forum, so it's the perfect solution (if you use Firefox, that is).</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-1 12:08</div>
<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>That is indeed a useful facility, and it's one I will suggest to the Squarespace people. <br><br>For some reason I can't make SiteDelta work on my computer. It must be something to do with my cookie settings. I've put a task on my list to investigate!</div>

<div class="content">It's early and my mind is probably still absorbing caffine ... but until it reaches the requiste concentration ;-) ... I tried SiteDelta and after the scan I saw the first 1/2 dozen or so topics highlighted in yellow.  COOL!  I read the first one and when I went back to the list of topics, the yellow had vanished.  It then said: "One change found" ... but NONE were highlighted.  Is it me, is the coffee too weak, or SiteDelta misbehaving on my computer?  ;-)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-1 14:02</div>
<div class="content">It took me a while to get SitDelta optimally set up. One thing important for watching the forum is to define the region that is being watched. You can do  this by right-clicking on the delta icon the bottom right and select Regions -> +Watch Region, then use the mouse to select the region in which all the posts are. So you won't get any false positives from microscopic changes in the surrounding page. I also saved these settings as a preset for <a href="http://markforster.net/forum*," rel="nofollow">http://markforster.net/forum*,</a> so it will be applied to any subpages of the forum I add.<br><br>Now open every thread you are interested in and click the Delta icon once to add that page to site delta. No you'll always get new posts in that discussions highlighted, and the forum overview can be used to see if there are new threads that might interest you. You then add these to SiteDelta, too.<br><br>So now you can set a timer interval for SiteDelta to look for changes, or you can do so manually by right-clicking the delta icon and selecting Pages -> Check all for Changes. If there are changed pages you get a red pages icon beside the delta icon. Right click this and select "open all in tabs". On each page now open click the delta icon once to have the new posts highlighted and scrolled to.</div>

<div class="content">If you only want to see changed threads in the overview, just hold ctrl while clicking on a highlighted topic name. That will open the topic in a new tab and you won't lose the highlighting in the overview.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-1 14:31</div>
<div class="content">WOW!  Thanks for all of that.  It seems a bit more fiddly than I hoped but then it will probably be worth the fussing once it is all set up.  I did not get any of that from browsing the web site.  Thanks again.  I'm sure your explanation will help others as well.</div>

<div class="content">@ Frank, Andreas: the pleasure is on my side :)<br><br>As Andreas has mentioned SiteDelta has nice features for restricting the region to watch.<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div class="content">@Seraphim<br><br>I use a system essentially the same as you, but why bother with the sticky note on the back of your book? When I finish reading the forum and cross-out & re-add the task in my AF list, the re-added task is simply written as "AF forum (from 30/7 12:20)" - with the current date/time, obviously!<br><br>Works for me so far - although I think I'm just about to write "Try out SiteDelta for AF forum" on the list ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">I also keep a note of the last time visited but just work backwards from that time when revisiting the site as any additions whilst I am working my way through would throw out the order otherwise.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve,<br><br>I first tried it exactly as you describe.  But I ran into a problem since I had multiple occurrences of the task "Check AF Forum" on my list.  That's when I off-loaded the date/time stamp to a separate list.<br><br>Those multiple occurrences were helpful with AF1, but I'm finding they just add clutter with RAF, so perhaps I'll go back to putting the date/time stamp right in the AF list together with the task itself.<br><br>I've been using SiteDelta the last few days, but it has problems with VPN apparently (can't find the proxy?).  It keeps getting a script timeout error message.</div>
