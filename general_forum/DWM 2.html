<div class="content">Leon, <br>as far as I know it is described at<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10307721" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10307721</a><br>and<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1310798" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1310798</a><br><br>If my memory serves me well, the term DWM2 was coined by Nuntym at<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1285362" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1285362</a><br><br>The rules of what was later called "DWM2" are (according to Mark Forster):<br><br>You can use an ordinary notebook and have only one entry point as follows:<br><br>1. Have one continuous list of tasks as in Autofocus<br><br>2. When you enter a new task, put a mark next to it to show it is a new task (I use a black dot).<br><br>3. When you re-enter a task, leave out the black dot.<br><br>4. At the beginning of a new day, leave a blank line and enter the day's date on the next line.<br><br>5. Then cross out any days earlier than one month previous, and dismiss any tasks which do not have black dots against them on pages earlier than one week previous.</div>
