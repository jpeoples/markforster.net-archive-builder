<div class="content">@michael - i'd give it a poor rating. There's a lot to wade through to get to, imho, the gist of the system. Tony also delves into a lot of areas he has little expertise in... and it shows. In theory, RPM is a great system. Or at least I thought so when I was married without children. Now... not so much. I don't have time - or don't want to make time - in the morning/evening for complex productivity systems. Speaking of which, I'm on week 3 or 4 of using Daylite, with a cobbled together system of my own.</div>

<div class="content">I'd give it a high rating in the "here's why you ought to adopt this system of thinking" and a lower rating in the "tell me the simplest possible way to implement your system mechanically that takes very little time and uses inexpensive materials". It's taken me time to completely understand the why's of the system so that I might simply the mechanics. Now it's fun, easy to use, and inexpensive.</div>
