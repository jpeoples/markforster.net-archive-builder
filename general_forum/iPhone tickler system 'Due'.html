<div class="content">Hey guys,<br><br>I wanted to let you know about a nice little app called 'Due' on the Apple iPhone store, www.dueapp.com. It costs €3.99 in the Belgian app store, I guess that's $4.99 in USD or something like that. I've grown really fond of it in the past week and a half or so.<br><br>I use it for:<br><br>1) Daily tasks that I have to do at a certain part of the day (e.g. cleaning up my room in the evening)<br>2) Weekly tasks that I might see too late in my SF notebook (e.g. watering the orchids every weekend)<br>3) Reminders of stuff I need to add to my SF notebook when I don't have it with me (e.g. when I'm on my bike or at the sports centre)<br>4) Ticklers of tasks to be added to SF in several weeks time. (e.g. birthday presents to be bought, or reports to be worked on two months from now)<br><br>A nice feature is that it syncs with dropbox, so you always have a backup there.<br><br>Too bad it's not cheaper, but I think it is worth a hamburger.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tijl</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the pointer, Tijl.  I'm loving the Due app!  It fills in the gaps between the calendar and the built-in iPhone alarms, and is very easy to use.</div>
