<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>We all try to make our planning fit our needs and tweak with different tools.<br><br>I want to know how is your current setup ? Explain how you use it <br><br>- Do you use Paper or Software ? <br>I turned back to Paper after tweaking my softwares but can not find the perfect setup :)<br><br>- Do you use AF1/ AF4 ... SF ? or other setups ?<br>I test SF but not find the right runs yet. I know it will come :)<br><br>Have a nice Week :)</div>

<div class="content">My current setup is quite simple: <br>two spiral pads (one for the office and one for at home) and a calendar book (all paper).<br><br>Each of the spiral pads contains: <br>a section for input and notes,<br>a someday list for stuff to do in the far future,<br>a near-future list for stuff to do in the next 3 to 4 weeks,<br>a weekly focus list for big tasks to do this week (big rocks),<br>an AF2 list for the daily work.<br><br>The calendar book I use for appointments and scheduled work (most important/urgent tasks).<br><br>Recently I switched from AF4 to AF2.<br><br>Daily and weekly reviews.<br><br>That's all I need.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Personal:<br>I use a cheap spiral pocketsized notebook as inbox device. I carry it nearly always with me. That's the reason, why I put errands on the backsite of the list. I also carry a pilot g-2 (pen) in my right trouser pocket (clip outside - pen inside).<br><br>I pocess stuff from this notebook in an similar way as DA suggests.<br><br>Stuff which will not be sorted out will go to my SF list - a pocket sized moleskin (the thin one, which comes in 3 notebooks in one package). Left site C1 - right site C2.<br>I work with the list exactly to the rules of SF.<br>If the molesin is full, I transfer important/outstanding stuff to a new one and dismiss the rest. <br><br>For time related stuff I use a pocket sized moleskin calender (1 week on 2 pages - horizontal).<br><br>I switch form AF1DiT (a AF1 tweak which combines Autofocus and DoItTomorrow in an IMHO effective way) to SF. Compared, I found SF more balanced. I'm quite sure that SF will also work as SFDiT. But I will give plain SF a chance.<br><br>The only shortcoming (but I can't blame SF) is, that I can't go through the whole list in one day. To much ad-hoc stuff coming up if I leave the car after commuting from work and enter my home ;-) <br><br>I also do a weekly review (I have an entry in my calendar every friday) where I check ~ 2 weeks before and ~6 weeks after the current day. I also check my projectlist and do a slow reading/thinking of the task on my SF list. In this go some of the entries will be deleted, rephrased, etc.<br><br>Work:<br>I use Outlook as hard landscape and started a week ago with SF on excel (before I used AF1DiT with mylifeorganzied).<br><br>- Jens</div>

<div class="content">Paper. More precisely, a coat-pocketable notebook (same height as A6 paper but slightly narrower). A problem I've always had with my to-do systems is neglecting to actually use them. One part of that problem is simple (lack of) physical presence. Books or binders that are bulky tend to get stowed away out of sight. Lists on a computer are entirely out of sight until called up. The current notebook so far has managed to be reliably present. (The one downside of a smaller notebook is that it only gives around 20 lines per page. I combine facing pages into a single "virtual" page.)<br><br>With this notebook always present, my second important time management component, the calendar, could actually be on a computer. It currently isn't, but that's not an important choice.<br><br>In another thread, I've described a precursor to the system I run in that notebook (called AF Advance). I don't currently recommend trying it as described.<br><br>To my thinking, it is important that the AF1-like systems, like the one I'm using, are not a substitute for a calendar or a clock. They work best with tasks that are ready to do now, but at the same time not so urgent that they have to be done immediately, or at a specific time.</div>

<div class="content">Only 10 days into SF. I've been home on vacation and go back to work today. At home I've been using a large Moleskine (cahier) I've been using it for collecting and doing. I haven't yet figured how my old OmniFocus-GTD system will fit into it. I'll reflect on that next weekend. For now, as I've dismissed things that I will want to revisit, I've put them into one Single Action List in OF. So I'm thinking I'll use OF as part of my review process, but not to work from (I work better from paper). I use iCal for my calendar-type things.<br><br>I go back to work today. I teach high school math. My day is very structured. :) I look forward to setting up a separate notebook there. I'm thinking that I'll use a composition book. I know I'll scribble more and I want the increased size. Plus, I have a few so I don't mind giving it a try 'for free' and moving to something else if necessary.  <br><br>I found that any of my 'buy X' tasks tend to make me have an excuse to run out and get X when I'd be better off doing that another time. This is not because of the rules of SF but because I use shopping as an excuse not to do other things. If I think of something, I'll write it on my SF list because I'm often not sure if I'll go buy it or purchase it online. If I find it's a 'go buy it' task, I'll put it on a separate list. I will probably go back to some kind of software for this, but for now my bigger items are on a separate page in my home Moleskin and my grocery-type items are on a post it on the first page of it.</div>

But you will be buoyed by the thought that only a few pages on there's still plenty of easy stuff!</div>

<div class="content">My system is a Blueline notebook a9  7 by 9 inches.  I use it for to dos.  Some days I will make a list of three important things to do other days I will just cycle through the pages.  Work and personal is all in there.  Additionally, I keep notes on a single separate legal pad.  I will review the pad and add to dos from the notes and then file or toss the notes.  I use outlook for calendar and contacts.<br><br>Gerry</div>

Maybe those 'wins' and crossing those things off my list helped me move forward more quickly on other things. But given another priority of being less wasteful (gas and money), I'd have preferred to save them all up and make one trip. And even then, some of the things could have waited. <br><br>Maybe I should write 'get a cookie' on every page to move me forward? ;)</div>

"<br><br>Here's how I handle this: I do put "buy x" on the list, or more often, "shopping list: item I need".  Then when there's a critical mass of those I actually MAKE the list and then put "run errands" as a new item.  It's worked so far and avoids the extra trips out and wasted time & gas.</div>

It works very well for making sure I take regular breaks through the day.   Sometimes it gets written as "coffee" or "tea" or "lunch", and once I did write "cookie".  :-)</div>

<div class="content">My setup is:<br><br>Filofax pocket for calendar (can carry everywhere with me and has room for notes and other things I like to have with me).<br>Moleskin Cahier for SF (soft cover extra large - quite slim - the ones you buy with three in a pack).<br>Snopake noteguard hard cover notebook (fab paper you really can use a fountain pen, nicely laid out page which lends itself to drawing lines etc, nice colour covers - but still OK for business).<br>iPhone for contacts<br>Filofax A5 for business info - for example sign ons to different sites, quick look up phone number for projects, project lists etc.<br>For large projects they have their own project file<br><br>I never realised I had a system until I wrote it down!!</div>

<div class="content">Moleskine large (thin) notebook, squared paper<br>SFv3<br><br>Outlook for hard-edge stuff, or ABF (Absolutely Bloody Final), with alarm.  I also put reminder tasks from Sfv3 list eg "R: call freight agent" = Reminder (into Outlook), call freight agent for context stuff or too far ahead to clutter the active list<br><br>Web site access and other passwords etc kept in e-Wallet which syncs with my Windows Mobile 6.5 smartphone.<br><br>I also carry a Moleskine pocket notebook (soft cover) for noting stuff when I'm away from my Sfv3 notebook or computer.<br><br>@Malisa: I try to get around the multiple errands in the list by keeping Errands on a page in the pocket notebook.  On my way home or on another trip I will look to see what errands can be done in that time interval eg, bank, buy PAYGO credit, water pack, bottle red wine etc.<br><br>If some things can only be done in another context, I might start a list for that context in the pocket notebook eg Under Errands DBN Airport might be: Get local PAYG simcard, ATM draw Rands, contact home re arrival.<br><br>As I've mentioned in previous posts (ad infinitum ad nauseum?), I'm waiting for a business-friendly tablet device with acceptable handwriting to replace the SFv3 notebook, and other things.  Later this year or next year . . . . ?</div>

<div class="content">Home: double-spiral hard cover notebook, 30 lines, 9x7"<br>Calendar (1 line/day) and daily checklists in front, SF in back.<br>Work: Same system, but in OneNote, and I log daily activity.<br>Road: business cards.<br><br>How I use it: Every day I review the checklists, check the calendar, then switch to the back.  End of day I go back to the checklists and calendar.<br><br>The work system is is exactly the same, but the technical details are tricky. Although OneNote can imitate the paper system and have two columns of tasks per virtual page, I find another way more useful.  Another thread perhaps.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, please do share your OneNote implementation with us! <br><br>Also, Im intrigued by your "Calendar (1 line/day) and daily checklists in front", could you give more details about this?<br><br>I also wanted to ask you, have you found a way to make your AF project system (which i found very interesting) work with SF, or have you abandonned it?<br><br>In short, could you please start a thread going into more details about your current setup (if you think it is mature enough to be shared, and if you are able to find the time for this!)<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">For OneNote, it's complicated to explain.  AF4 in OneNote was easy.  SF expects me to track columns and cross-out tasks which is decidedly unnatural to my usage of the tool.  I need more pleas before I'll try to explain my solution.</div>

<div class="content">Fair enough Alan, I think I will (and should) use a 100% paper-based setup anyway (with the exception of reminders from my basic, non web-connected phone, and MAYBE an electronic calendar). I was curious about this because I like OneNote, but mostly as a Personal Information Manager. Now, Im still curious about how you're doing it, it will be interesting to know if you ever get down to explaining it.</div>
