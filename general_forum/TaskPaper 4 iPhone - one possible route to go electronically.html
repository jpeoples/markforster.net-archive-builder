<div class="content">I can't say how Taskpaper would do for any particular system, but it is a great tool for project planning. The new iPhone app has an absolutely brilliant user interface.</div>

<div class="content">I've used and loved Taskpaper. Are you thinking about using for the new DWM?<br><br>I'd be curious to hear what you work out!</div>

<div class="content">Yes ds, I'm currently using TaskPaper Touch for DWM - I'll write a short summary in the next few days, how I worked it out ;)</div>

<div class="content">Seems like the problem would be: Dates. Since the new Task Mover (DWM) is so reliant on dates, wouldn't you have to hand enter an expiration date for each task in Task Paper?</div>
