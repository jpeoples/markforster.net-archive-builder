<div class="content">Just finished reading Dreams after a long hiatus from the Discussion Forum (was never a big contributer but find myself coming back again and again to see what's new). I came across this book on writing a legacy and final wishes in a fun way. Perhaps for those folks who want to leave no stone unturned (like me), filling out this book might be an inverse way to find out what one really wants :-)  <a href="http://obitkit.com/index.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://obitkit.com/index.html</a></div>

<div class="content">And on another note of having a dialogue with our future selves - what about the tool of writing an ethical will - a Jewish custom of leaving a written spiritual legacy for one's children. Also, a way to clarify values which seems to be the foundation for "what we want" and "don't want" in our lives.<br><br><a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/life/Life_Events/Death_and_Mourning/Dying/Ethical_Wills.shtml" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.myjewishlearning.com/life/Life_Events/Death_and_Mourning/Dying/Ethical_Wills.shtml</a><br><br>There's also some books on Amazon under keywords Jewish Ethical Will.</div>

<div class="content">I recently read somewhere else regarding contemplating/writing your own obituary, and identifying what to do to make it comes true. It referred to Frasier Crane episode ...<br><a href="http://www.frasieronline.co.uk/episodeguide/season7/ep8.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.frasieronline.co.uk/episodeguide/season7/ep8.htm</a> :-)</div>

<div class="content">One might also contemplate what sort of journal would publish one's obituary - a magnificent eulogy in "The Hampster Owners Monthly" doesn't perhaps quite cut the mustard!</div>

<div class="content">Either due to denial or age, I was never able to use death as a values/priority distiller. I remember reading 7 Habits, and almost abandoning the whole process due to this exercise. I think  Barbara Sher nailed this process down with Wishcraft - particularly the first 1/3 of the book. Mark's GAM would be 2nd.</div>
