<div class="content">Have you considered setting up an AF Yahoo group? I'm on the DIT group and it doesn't really seem appropriate anymore. I don't mind the forum, but the email format is easier for me.</div>

<div class="content">That's a very good idea, since searching the forum is a little cumbersome (esp. because you cannot search by author, as it seems). Having the messages in my email program would make it more manageable.</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br>The DIT Yahoo group isn't run by me, although I belong to it and comment occasionally. <br><br>I'd prefer it if some enterprising individual (you?) would take on the task of owning and moderating it as a private initiative. I've got quite enough on my plate with this forum and I would prefer to keep everything that I'm responsible for on my own website.<br></div>

<div class="content">Alex:<br><br>Yes, it's annoying that one can't search by author and that there's no email feed. However the advantages of using this forum outweigh the disadvantages for me. If anyone wants to start up their own forum on the subject, I would be happy to provide a link to it on this site.</div>

<div class="content">I've created a group called AutoFocusTM on Yahoo. I look forward to having anyone join who wants to discuss AF off the web. I look forward to more opportunities for personal sharing and file sharing!</div>

<div class="content">Mel, <br><br>I tried to subsribe to the group via the povided link,  but never received the confirmation email. This might be due to my email provider (had similar problems in the past), where such emails get lost often (no, they're not in the spam folder), but maybe you'd like to know.</div>
