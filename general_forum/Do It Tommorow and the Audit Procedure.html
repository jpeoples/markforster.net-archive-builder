<div class="content">Hi Mark and everyone, <br><br>I'm trying to get into more depth with your Auditing concept for DIT. I've looked at your article 'Auditing your Time Management' and the linked article 'have you got too much work?' , but have not been able to locate other articles...<br><br>Could you or others possibly point me in the right direction re useful resources within this site or other sites with specific regard to Audits?  <br><br>Many thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and everyone, scrub the above request - tried DIT again yesterday and found I had too many 'workarounds' for me to make it run smoothly: I think AF2 is much simpler:)</div>
