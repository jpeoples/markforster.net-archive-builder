<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Here is an interesting post on a GTD blog.  I thought you would find this interesting because this is at the heart of "Do it Tomorrow".  What are your thoughts here?<br><br><a href="http://www.davidco.com/blogs/kelly/" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidco.com/blogs/kelly/</a><br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I can't find your post either.  Perhaps there is a waiting period so they can review submissions before they are posted?  Could you please add your post here so we can see what you said?<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Yes, you're right. My comment has been removed (or not approved by the moderator). They probably don't accept contributions from promoters of rival systems - a short-sighted policy in my view but it's their blog and they can do what they want!<br><br>Unfortunately I didn't keep a copy of what I posted - it was nothing earth-shattering I assure you.</div>

<div class="content">Oh my goodness -- that is SO incredibly short-sighted!  Why are they afraid of discourse on this topic.  Well, I will yell it very loud here -- this is what makes DIT so special in that it creates a buffer to all of the incoming stuff so that one can focus -- got that Folks -- FOCUS --  on what you have important and on your plate for the day.  It has made all of the difference in the world in my work.  I am more productive, efficient, and able to enjoy my work days more than I ever have been in the past due to DIT.  There are many good things about GTD that I do adapt -- a Waiting For list, a Someday/Maybe list -- but my workflow is DIT and it works!<br><br>Best to all,<br>-David</div>
