<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-20 8:16</div>
<div class="content">What does “Busy Life” mean?<br><br>Let me start by saying it again: “AF is an excellent idea, beautiful out-of-the-box thinking, a great system.” Let me add: “Mark Forster is by far the most original and interesting time management thinker today, in my opinion.”<br><br>I read with great interest all the posts that have been added to the thread I started, questioning the universality of AF. I suggested it would not work well for very busy people. Most of the commenters tried to convince the other readers and me by claiming how extremely busy they are and how well the system works for them nevertheless.<br><br>In my  opinion nobody who has the time to read and post here, let alone beta-test AF, is truly very busy.<br><br>As I said before, I am semi-retired and lead what I call a leisurely life, yet I am too busy to beta-test, too busy to even to read more than maybe one percent of the posts here or to try to understand how this  forum software works (erratic and unpredictable to me). Yet, compared to the times when I was REALLY busy, I lead a leisurely life.<br><br>Really busy people do not spend their time reading or writing forum posts or beta-testing any system however promising it may be.<br><br>This said, AF certainly lends itself very nicely to many people, and we all have to be grateful to Mark Forster for the time and effort creating it and bringing it to life.<br><br>But AF is not universal. And, quite frankly, I do not see why it should. Would that make it any more beautiful, or would the lack of universality make it any less attractive to those who find it useful? Every person is different, everybody’s life situation is different and keeps evolving over time. And everybody’s time management system should be tailored to their needs.<br><br>Today I use DIT with a few elements of GTD thrown in; it works well for me. When something misfires in my system, I have a look and adjust it. Maybe one day my situation will have changed sufficiently for me to consider AF.<br><br>In the mean time I hope that we will not see the quasi religious, dogmatic battles that have have been fought by some adopters of GTD about is universality and superiority.<br><br>I wish Mark Forster and you all the success with AF that you deserve.<br><br>Just my very humble opinion.<br><br>Chris<br><br>P.S. Sorry to start a new thread, but this forum software appears erratic, and a new thread seems the best way to make a topic visible again. I am sure there is some weird logic behind it all, but nowadays my patience with unintuitive software is extremely limited. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Have been using GTD for several years and a GTD-DIT-mixture for two years.  After using AF for two weeks now I am starting to realize what went wrong with my system, e.g. ill-defined contexts, neglecting the will-do list, and bad management of resources. <br></div>

<div class="content">It's amazing how many of us who are part of this forum have followed a similar path from GTD to DIT and now on to AF.<br><br>For me Mark has picked up at the point where GTD fell down for me, i.e at the level of generating, maintaining and actioning a task list.  I usually kept adding "sophistications" to help me to keep faithfully to the GTD system.<br><br>Now with AF the tendency is to keep simplifying my approach and to rely heavily on the list to anchor me, energise me, steer me, reassure me and carry me forward when the going gets tough.  The task list is the keystone of the system.  Or, to change the metaphor, it is a kind of safety net that catches me when I find I am tending to fall away from "really going places".</div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris<br><br>I can see where you are coming from and why it must seem that people who have the time to post on a forum such as this can't really be busy at all.  As one of the most prolific posters (sorry folks!) let me explain where that time is coming from, for me at least .........<br><br>I started AF on January 5 from a place of major panic, with "stuff to do", deadlines (and definitely not imaginery ones) serious issues to resolve surrounding parents' health needs which could not be ignored, etc., and had completely forgotten what it felt like to have any sense of control, or any *me* time whatsoever.  I was in the fortunate position of having looked at sufficient stuff regarding intuition etc in the past, that for me AF worked straight out of the box. Probably just as well or I might well be in one by now! :-)<br><br>I was spending all my time on "must do's" and even leisure time felt uncomfortable because it always felt as though I "ought" to be doing something else.  So where has my time to post etc. come from if I was so busy? Firstly my productivity has sky-rocketed.  Say I had tasks that at full productivity would take 5 hours and I had a 7 hour "working" day.  In that day I may complete say 4 hours work due to procrastination, and just plain exhaustion.  Every day that continued I would be building up an hour's backlog. Nothing felt easy - I was just swimming through treacle.  Just by that change alone, that example produces an extra 2 hours a day - and stops a backlog build up!<br><br>In addition to that I am using those small blocks of time that would have been wasted.  On my "Frantic Fridays" I only have very small time blocks of discretionery time available to me.  That time was wasted as "too small to do anything in".  Now that time is utilised (email/forum/lists or whatever).<br><br>In addition I genuinely have more energy so am sleeping less, as anyone who looks at the ridiculous times of some of my posts will realise (and yes I am based in the UK!)  If you take the example of the "working day" above, you could say that my working day has actually increased to 10 or more hours *but* I feel like I am hardly working at all.  In fact it feels like I have been given permission to work on all of my hobbies for as long as I want and when I want!<br><br>You may say that my current working life (being in a home environment) is not typical.  However I have run my own businesses, employing staff, travelling for weeks at a time with maybe 7 meetings a day, and yes I got a lot done and effectively, but it was never easy.  People may have seen me as highly organised and efficient and having all the answers, but we see what we want to see - that did not mean that I was just coasting along having a ball ..... far from it. Although of course I believed that everyone else in my industry was totally in control and having that proverbial ball ....... i suspect that may not have true either....... :-)<br><br>I am sure that many many people are doing excellently with other systems.  I have friends who looked at my systems and procedures and say "why don't you just do it?" I knew I "should", I could help others to "just do it" but I honestly did not know the answer to the question they were asking.  Why didn't I "just do it?"  It's an easy enough question to give an answer to - we can always justify our abuse of time - but was it the correct answer?  No, because I didn't actually know the correct answer!<br><br>Chris, you may well feel that this answer confirms your thoughts - that's ok.  Many many people do seem to be able to "just do it".  Whether that is "easy" for them I couldn't say.  I'm sure there must be a lot of people who just naturally work on the intuitive basis generated by AF and that therefore for them it *is* easy.  What I do know is that, for me, AF is less about managing my time than enabling me do things, less about a system than enabling me see what is really important to me, less about lists than giving me back my life.  Is AF about Time Management? Of course. Is it a system?  Absolutely - and one with rules to follow. Is it about lists? Yes it is.  But the overwhelming benefit of AF is the way in which it does what it says - it enables Focus - and for many busy people that is the one thing that gets lost amongst all of the clutter.<br><br>Is it a magic potion that will cure all of the ills of the world?  Definately not - but it would certainly give someone in that line of work the ability to think clearly enough to create one! :-) <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Chris (again):<br><br>Of course beta-testing AF and taking part in the Forum *is* my job, so I guess I'm exempt from your strictures about the idle lives of those who have time to take part in this forum. :-) <br><br>There are over 2,500 people beta testing AF, and only a tiny fraction of those people are regularly posting on this forum (probably no more than 10 posting on a daily basis). But perhaps you regard that as evidence that only a tiny fraction of people find it worth posting about?<br><br>The one question I would like to ask you (because you haven't stated it in either of your posts) is whether you've actually tried the system yourself, or whether you are just theorising about it.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">If I am a busy man is a matter of opinion, of course. But it is not the point here. AF is used by people in order to be more productive and do this with a self commitment and enjoy.<br><br>We always deserve time to things that we like. It is better to assume that AF is a  mix  of a toy and a tool very addictive and useful  to certain people than classify us as not busy people. <br><br>AF is not suitable to those that are not interested in their productivity, busy or not.<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-20 13:38</div>
<div class="content">I might add that if there are 2,500 testers and only 10 are regular posters, it is perhaps the case that maybe 500 or more read the posts fairly regularly.<br><br>As to time usage ... I am a frequent poster and the actual time I spend posting is much smaller than it probably seems.  There are usually only about a dozen threads modified over night and it is quick enough to go to the last two or three entries.  Of those, I feel like commenting on some fraction, and of those actual posts, my writing time is fairly short (as anyone who has seen my sloppy usage can gather ;-)  Were I to give it more time, my comments would be more polished.<br><br>Finally, I don't think that it is possible to evaluate the lives of others ... at least not in any meaningful way.  My posting is my way of learning.  Once I feel I have grasped what I need, I tend to fade away.  That is just my learning style.  You may well decide that this is not a useful or productive way to learn something ... so be it.  Your evaluation has to be in terms of your own values ... not the values of others.<br><br>As to your basic question about how well it helps really busy people ... I don't think that is a useful question.  I don't think how well any system works is related to how busy the user is, but how well the system meshes with the "style" of the user.<br><br>One last thought.  AF does not claim to work only if it supplants all other methods of work.  It claims to work well to whatever extent it is used.  IOW, if you work in an environment rich in meetings, you may be calendar driven and only able to use AF outside of that.  No problem ... to whatever extent you can use AF, it ought to work well.</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br>As a "really busy person" (TV Producer & Writer) I carve out time from my really busy schedule to  seek out ways to reduce the stress of my "really busy" life.  The "really busy" colleagues in my industry are constantly complaining about how stressed they are by their "really busy" lifestyles.  Many of them keel over on the set from exhaustion or coronaries, or other stress ailments and are carted away by  ambulance.   Many of these really busy people are my employees and I look for ways to help them reduce the stress they experience in their daily lives. (This keeps my medical insurance costs down, plus I like most of them)  I urge all of my "really busy" employees to seek out ways to gain control over the onslaught of demands of their positions so they do not end up stressed and leaving work in an ambulance. <br><br>You might also check here for further data regarding your theory about busy people and beta testers.  <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/634829" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/634829</a><br><br>Best of luck and health in your retirement. <br></div>

<div class="content">This issue of being "too busy" is what I had in mind with my "existential terror" post a few days ago. It is possible for people to make themselves so busy that, in effect, they are using the tasks to wallpaper over the cracks so no glimpse of reality shines through.<br><br>I applaud and encourage such whirls of activity if people are using their time to advance their unique talent/purpose, but it can also be a convenient defence against slowing down enough to reflect on that.<br><br>Yesterday I added to my list, plan to give talk at next Open Studios, "How to make room in your life for art".</div>

<div class="content">GTD was overkill for me.  It required too much time relative to the payoff.  I never found the contexts useful.  The idea that I had a list of things to do at a phone, at my computer etc seemed silly to me on top of next action lists, since most times I had most tools available to me.  It became too many lists which translated to less time actually doing.<br><br>I boiled GTD and DIT into my ebook to simplify life and then AF further simplified life for me.  That is not to say that some concepts like a weekly review, or creating an agenda for when you speak to some to make the meeting more focused are not good ideas, but honestly these things are not GTD inventions.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">As a non-poster, I would like to express my appreciation for the generosity of those who share their efforts to test and perfect AF.<br><br>As for what a very busy person can/should fit into their day, I take with the view expressed by Tom DeMarco in Slack that being too busy means that if anything substantial changes in the environment of my work I will not have sufficient cycles to adapt or improve, but just keep doing till I hit the iceberg.<br><br>I am another GTD devotee and Mark Forster fan from DIT.  As a project manager and business owner I have way too many committed tasks to cycle through them in a single list, so I use software tools (from msproject with prochain on down to todolist) to structure where my attention is needed.<br><br>That said, I am finding AF extremely useful as a part of the system; especially the closed list aspect is brilliant.  I have always had trouble sitting down with all my projects and generating next actions.  With AF I rub my nose in a resistant task until it gives way to something I can do; the "little and often" aspect sets my unconscious mind to problem solving.<br><br>AF, for me, is becoming where my focus is sharpened.  Once I have decided (by reviewing my project lists) that I need to take action now on some issue, it goes on the AF list and then it is grist for the mill.  If not on this pass, then on the next or the next I will make progress.</div>

<div class="content">Chris says "but AF is not universal"<br><br>I don't think Mark would necessarily suggest it is. For example see this post of where Autofocus seems not to be working for one "busy person". Yet even he has been a regular forum poster for a long time:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/640902" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/640902</a><br><br>I also think Mike has something when he says it may be more to do with the 'style' of the user than how busy they are.<br><br>When I was in an employed (office based) environment I developed a system very similar to Autofocus using a reporter's notebook and a continuing 'to do' list, mainly to keep track of everything. Much of what I did was reactive - to phone calls, an e-commerce site, courses that the company ran starting, etc. and so was 'off list' anyway. However, there was still room for procrastinating on non-urgent tasks (on the list) until they either faded into oblivion or became urgent and the nature of the closed list approach of Autofocus would have helped here.<br><br>I think Stark sums up one aspect of "busy people" well - so busy they don't look after themselves, let stress levels get too high and the only way they slow down or stop is when their body does it for them!<br><br>However, coming back to Chris, I do think there are probably some very busy people out there who work perfectly well without Autofocus because they do look after other things than just work and have developed their own methods for getting things done. But as to whether anyone who has time to browse/post to a forum is not truly very busy that's a matter of opinion and priorities. If, as part of their work, someone prioritizes this forum as something they can use for their benefit I don't think that automatically means they are not very busy. However, if by very busy you mean someone who runs around like a headless chicken until they drop dead of a heart attack then maybe Chris is right!!<br><br>I have found Autofocus most useful not actually for getting things done (although it has helped with that) but actually for highlighting the areas where I'm not getting things done and making me reassess them. The name is spot on for what it can help achieve. Focusing on what's important (as opposed to just urgent) is something I have noticed a lot of "very busy people" sometimes lack. Now, like I say, there is an important distinction between very busy people who are happily organised and achieving what they want and the headless chickens described by Stark who are heading straight for that ambulance. Good luck to the first if they have their own systems working well, but it may be the second group who would benefit greatly from Autofocus but then maybe they won't make time to change their ways until it's too late??<br><br>Oh, and for the record I probably don't count as a "very busy person" by some people's definition. I've been there, done that and now I use my time very differently so I am a human being more than a human doing! I've found it's good for the soul...</div>

I found some excellent advice in here for getting back in the studio (having not painted for around 2 months +).<br><br>And another book for once you get there is "Fearless Creating" by Eric Maisel<br><br>I agree that it is all too easy to be a "very busy person" while neglecting the most important things.

<div class="content">Hi, as an IT director, I carry about 30 active projects at a time. I am able to keep these going pretty well,  but I fall down in my personal life.  There  I am primary breadwinner for my family, and caretaker of a mentally challenged family member.  I am sometimes so overwhelmed by procrastination, and depression, that I am immobilized. <br><br>With AF, I have been able to put my tasks down on paper, and be even more efficient at work-- but the main thing is I am now getting over my procrastination and depression about my personal life. I can mobilize myself into just "doing it."

<div class="content">I think one thing that needs to be recognised is that whether we appear to be incredibly busy or not, we are all filling 24 hours a day with a series of actions. (For this purpose I'm including "sleep" and "veg out in front of the tv" as actions). Our lives in other words are lived as a linear series. <br><br>This is one reason why I think AF is effective. It puts everything into the same format that we are always going to be living in - a linear series. Whenever we hive things off into separate lists, we are getting away from that basic linear arrangement.</div>
<h2>Reply by Hannah</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-25 16:10</div>
<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I agree with the analogy of living in a linear fashion. The only thing with separate lists is that it is a way of placing a separate context around some of those linear tasks. So, for instance, my studio list is still a linear list but is placing that particular list in the physical context of my studio. The work/home split is the same.<br><br>As for errands on a separate list this is similar and also makes it easier to see all of the things that need doing while away from home at one glance rather than having to scan all the pages to find them.<br><br>So I guess I'm saying that the linear thing still applies but within the separate lists. Of course it helps to have as few lists as possible so that it is easier to keep the overall focus that I find works so well in Autofocus.</div>

<div class="content">For me, the sad part about Chris' post is it's closed approach to new thinking. If he truly is as busy as he says, he's not going to get any better at ordering his life with the attitude he has - and then appeals to my ego to get me to do the same. Heaven forbid he takes this approach to new ideas in all the other areas of his life.... "I am just to busy to get better at doing what I do."<br><br>Mark, thanks for taking time to think these things through, and for making them available. I too take breaks from the things I must get done in order to regain some sense of perspective when doing them. I have appreciated your work.<br><br>Gordon</div>

<div class="content">The two most effective people I ever worked for never gave the impression of being busy. When I say that they were commanders in a time of war you will realise that they were facing pressures that most people in civilian jobs can't even imagine.<br><br>The main secret of their effectiveness (apart from being highly intelligent and good at their jobs) was focus. They put their focus on what they wanted to achieve (basically one thing) and let nothing distract them from it.<br><br>Although I don't think any system on its own can ever make me as good as they were, one of the prime advantages of Autofocus for me is that it helps me to filter out the distractions. <br><br>Being too busy is a signal that you are not doing your job well. <br><br>I don't agree with everything that Tim Ferriss says in his "24-Hour Working Week" but here is a quote from the book which is right on the button:<br><br>"Being busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action."</div>

<div class="content">Hi Dean,<br><br>You Said:<br><br>"Main goal of any system is to get (right) things done."<br><br>I guess you mean that SHOULD be the main goal.  Often systems tend to evolve to feed off of themselves.  GtD seems to be one of those systems.  It is so complex that one ends up doing GtD more than the tasks that GtD is supposed to help you do!<br><br>You Said:<br><br>"Originally many people got interested in GTD since one gathered *all* things from<br>psychic RAM and decided concrete next actions etc."<br><br>I, for one, got interested because it offered a way to dig out from a bunch of backlog ... and the initial steps of dumping it all into one big pile and working it down with a simple triage to end up with a big filled trash can and everything else filed, made lots of sense.  What did NOT make sense was that "psychic RAM" garbage.  People go way too far with metaphor and get lost in them, IMO.  The human brain works very differently than a computer so it is misleading to try to explain mental processes as computer ones.  Writing things down makes sense without the added baggage of the "psychic RAM" metaphor.  Getting things out of your mind has limited application ... it is often useful to have things IN your mind for your subconscious to work on while you do other things.<br><br>You Said:<br><br>"However, GTD requires lot of work/maintenance. You first need to setup a system, collect and process everything, putting right contexts etc. I know, some people can get pay off from that.  But still, it doesn't get things done (easily)."<br><br>Much of that work is required no matter what system you use.  I found the idea of contexts to be wonderful ... until I found it to be nonsense ;-)  I mean, the idea is one of those that SHOULD work well, but did not, for me at least.  I have very few "contexts" as most of what I do I can do anytime.  There are some things that do require a place and time, but I still don't see them as "contexts" but as "projects".  For example: "Build a deck".  Now that is not a context but a project ... true, I have to be home to do most of the things, but then that is so obvious that I don't really need to make an @HOME context in order to know that I can't pour footings if I am not at home!  I mean, really now ;-)<br><br>For me it makes the most sense to group tasks by project, not where or when I do them.  I need to be out running errands in order to pick up 2x4 lumber for the deck, but I'm really not apt to do that in conjunction with a run to the grocery store.  I'll most likely make a special trip for it and take a truck!  There are many common sense things that get squashed by the inflexibility of the GtD system.  (As for how I do the same project in the AF model ... I just have the task "Work on Deck" on the list, then I pull out my project folder which has the plans, materials lists, reference material, etc. and see where I am ... then I grab the tools and a bottle of cold water and go outside to screw down some boards ;-)  I tend to make use of blocked time more than AF would dictate.  "Work on the Deck" would occupy me for several hours, the time being dictated more by my tolerance to the heat and humidity than my time management system!  (This also made me an outcast from the GtD groupies ;-)<br><br>BTW, I just saw a video interview with David Allen where he shows how he uses his desk.  It is surprisingly cluttered, and he has some duplication of files ... and those sit on his desk, distracting and taking up valuable real estate.  His book reads as though his life is streamlined but the video shows otherwise.  But whatever works for him, I guess ;-)<br><br>For contrast, see the video of Randy Pausch's system where he showed his desk and it had about three things on it ... nothing more.  A monument to focusing on the single task in front of one.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I enjoyed your post (as usual) and it is interesting what you said about the two videos.  I think I posted somewhere eons ago that a study showed that if we had more than 10 items in our visual space then our subconscious went into overdrive just trying to process it and our productivity took a nose dive.  I've experimented myself with the "I'm stressed - no, I just need to clear my desk" scenario and there certainly seems to be a lot of truth in that.  Just clearing the desk and working in a clear space does clear the mind - almost like Autofocus :-)<br><br>I know what you mean about the subconscious needing to work on things but I agree with Dean about the benefits of gettings things out of your mind.  However I think this is really more an issue of semantics - for me, that "getting things out of my mind" is out of the conscious mind, thus enabling the subconscious to process it without the constant nagging from the conscious mind trying to tell it what decision to come to.  Just putting that item on paper (in a place which is easily accessible to me at any time) is in itself telling me that I don't need to keep worrying about it - and gives me the comfort that (a) it won't be forgotten, and (b) I know where it is.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>I don't know what makes one person stall in a cluttered environment and another thrive.  It would be fascinating to research.  In most areas of my life I'm a "clutter person".  I've given a lot of thought to that and I have identified a mental process that causes/allows that:  I simply don't notice it.  Honestly, if I drop a sheet of paper on the floor I can step over it for weeks ... it is not bothering me so why should I bother it?  LOL ;-)<br><br>OTOH, my desk MUST be clear.  As must any "work" area.  The first task in building a deck is to lay out the tools ... and the last is to put them away.  When I worked in an electronics lab, my workbench was always orderly.  When I worked in an office I would not go home for the day before I cleared the surface of all paper.  There is something about a "work" environment that demands order.  When I get "stuck" I will pull out a can of desk spray and a rag and actually CLEAN the desk.  That seems to be my way of getting serious about things and might be my way of metaphorically enacting the task of "clearing the decks", as it were.<br><br>What baffles me is the question about why desks and work spaces must be cleared but other areas run wild.  Someday I'll figure that one out ;-)<br><br>As to the whole "psychic RAM" business ... I get parts of that idea ... just not the metaphor nor the obsession over it.  I have long had a notepad out to scribble random thoughts on to keep them out of my view as I was working.  That makes sense to me.  What does not is the obsessive list making so as to avoid the risk of thinking about anything ;-)  For example: I posted elsewhere today about how the mind handles time and memory.  David Allen, and his true believers, would have a collective heart attack at the notion that one would try to do something by remembering what it was.  Yet most people do that all the time ... and live lives outside of mental institutions ;-)<br><br>It has been conjectured that the invention of the printing press and widespread availability of reading and writing began the decline of our memories.  We used to have to remember things.  The news used to be sung from village to village by those with memories that would put them in the various halls of fame.  Once we no longer needed it, it began to decline.  My big problem with the GtD obsession with NOT trusting ones memory is that it tends to destroy memory and, ultimately, one has to remember to write it down, look it up, and even where the list is kept.  How will we do even that once memory has been finally and completely destroyed?  I'm not sure how much of an exaggeration that is.<br><br>Speaking for myself, I scribble "reminders" so as to keep the mental chatter down.  I don't need those notes for anything, I'll remember them again when needed.  I also tend to work from memory a whole lot more than is politically correct to admit in some of these time management communities.  I do it because I can, and because it works.  At the end of a day I can pull out a list I consulted not once and find only a very few things not accomplished.  (I'm talking about a list of things I honestly intended to do, not an AF list of unfiltered everything.)<br><br>Of course, it helps that out of desperation I took a memory course long ago and learned that there were specific ways to remember and have used those ever since.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>It would be a fascinating study to look at what makes people thrive in different envronments, clutter wise.  The article I read on the fact that the subconscious can only cope with 10 items was very interesting - I must try to find it (note: add to list!).  Like you I can happily walk over or around a pile of paper on the floor but the desk is a different matter - not that it is clear (far from it!) but I do notice a marked difference when it is.<br><br>I consider myself to have a pretty good memory but have noticed that the more stressed I am the more erratic it can become.  Interestingly I can remember lines from school plays and bizarre combinations of random characters such as certain government departments love to give you for passwords but forget loads of other stuff.  I guess a lot of it has to do with what we consider important at one time or another.<br><br>I have always used lists but it was not until AF that I was ever able to just lay my hands on where I might have written something down - I might have known it was "in a pile on my desk" but now .......... aaahh now I have "the" list!  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Re: the cluttered desk.  I think it comes down to how a person functions, more than the desk itself.  Some people have a messy desk and can't find a damn thing. I know you've been waiting in an office where someone has dug through piles of stuff looking for something while you were drumming your fingers.  The messy desk did not help him.  OTOH, there are people who know just which pile a paper will be in and magically pull it out when needed.<br><br>One thing that this type of clutter might be good for is creativity.  The subconscious exists to filter clutter and make sense of it.  And maybe it comes down to the type of work you do.  Executives tend to have much neater desks ... and the higher on the ladder, the cleaner.  There are obvious other reasons for them having a clean desk, but one simply is that they tend to focus more on people than paper.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>Memory is interesting because it has so many facets to it.  If we don't decide to remember something, we are not likely to remember it.  OTOH, if we train ourselves to observe and remember, our "memories" seem to take on a life of their own and we tend to remember a lot more stuff.  I recently heard a theory that during sleep the subconscious sorts the days events and forms long term memories of what it considers to be important.  That explains a lot.  By deciding what is important to us we program the subconscious to form long term memories of those things and trash the other stuff.<br><br>As to lists ... I keep lists mostly about things that are not important to me.  IOW, things that I will not naturally remember because they don't relate to my major interests.  Those which do, I find stick without my needing to write them down.  So, for example, my various reading projects are not on my list at all.  I know THAT I want to read, I do it WHEN I work best, I have the time blocked for that activity, I know WHAT I am currently reading, etc.  When I get to that time of the day, I just go to work on that "project" and for all the world no one would know I was doing it because it appears on no list no where ;-)  Yet it still gets done ... imagine ;-)<br><br>Compare that to my AF list which is filled with unimportant trivia: find my wife's iPod, fix the latest Vista crashing problem, sort my tools, empty the downstairs bath in preparation for a renovation, etc.  Those are the things that might get lost in the shuffle because they don't matter in the big picture.  But they are also the kind of thing that won't be forgotten because they keep popping up by themselves.  I find that the main point of AF is that it keeps me on track.  IOW, I'd remember that I have to sort those tools but I might not remember it when I'd have time for it.<br><br>I find that it pays for me to have well worn routines -- and those routines never hit the AF list.  I pay bills on Saturday morning ... that is just what I do and I don't need to have it on the list.  I plan my week on Sunday Morning over coffee with my neighbor ... again, I just do it.  I read during my reading time.  I knock off my activity when my wife gets home and we eat dinner and watch TV together.  Those kinds of things work well outside of AF and there they remain.  Our ability to build habits is one of mans most powerful abilities, IMO.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I certainly can't disagree with your comments but what I like about AF is the fact that it can be tailored to the needs of the individual at any given point in time.  Whilst I would love to be able to keep to routine times for things, there is very little possibility of my being in a position to do that for some time, but whereas before everything just ended up everywhere, with my AF lists I know that I now have a place to jot down all of those things that were clamouring for attention.<br><br>I absolutely agree with you about the way our subconscious works - unfortunately mine had thrown all of it's toys out of the pram and told me, in no uncertain terms, that if I wasn't going to take a holiday it was going without me!  And did! It just left it's very annoying cousin to nag me about all the things I should be doing!  Fun - I think not! :-)<br><br>It is very true that when something isn't used, such as memory or other brain functions, it gets lazy.  I was in a coffee shop at the weekend and the bill came to £6.44 so I handed ove £10.44.  The cashier told me she couldn't accept the 44p because "she had already rung it up" and insisted on me having change; she really couldn't understand the concept of calculation because the till did it for her.  I find that really quite sad .......<br></div>

The model I use (and it is only a model because we know so little about the mind) is that the subconscious serves to protect you and enhance your life ... according to the rules you fed to it in the past.  Feed it new rules and it will act differently ... but it really can't be shut off.  This is how I explain neurotic and psychotic processes.  If you refuse to abide by its dictates, it will do more than just throw a tantrum ... it will damn well take over driving the bus and leave you a helpless passenger yelling out the window for someone to call the cops.  Milton Erickson said that mental illness was simply being out of rapport with ones subconscious.<br><br>Re: 10.44.  Yipes.

<div class="content">Hi Jim,<br><br>What a wonderful article.  Well thought out.  I do have a couple of observations, however (big surprise there ;-)<br><br>I spent my workaday life in the computer industry,working in just about every aspect of it.  My last fields involved consulting on information flow and management and image storage systems ... so I have a bit of contact with these problems.<br><br>On the observation about air traffic controllers, I would say thank GOD for those "boats".  There is a big push to computerize the system and make the controllers give them up.  It has not happened yet because they can't develop a good reliable computerized system.  Imagine if you will, taking off in a plane and realizing that your flight was being protected from catastrophe by Windows Vista! !!!!!<br><br>The bottom line that everyone seems to get  (except those trying to sell hardware and software) is that paper does not crash ... and neither do the planes monitored by it.<br><br>I like his history but I do question his conclusion.  Is it that computerization is the problem or the current implementation?  I think that an implementation that represents information the WAY that paper does, but at the speeds and efficiency of computers is where we want to be.  Have you seen the displays where you touch the items and move them around?  I think those are the direction we want to go.  All that is needed is more powerful hardware and better designed software.<br><br>Another good idea is illustrated by the program "The Brain"<br><br><a href="http://www.thebrain.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebrain.com/</a><br><br>It is a more fluid kind of mind mapping designed to show the relationship of information.  It is a lot like those new computer displays.  Some good combination of these ideas would get by the objections that only paper allows us the flexibility to move things around and think.<br><br>I agree that to date, the paperless office has been a failure.  I first heard this term in the early 1970's ... maybe earlier.  To date the boss still has his secretary print off his emails onto paper so he can read them.  (I once had a boss who was passed over for promotion and  and saw him throw his keyboard and monitor into the trash -- quite literally ... CRASH!  ;-).  He was one of the companies outstanding technicians and that very perception prevented him from being accepted by those who were afraid of computers.)<br><br>And this is not true of just those who don't understand computers.  Past the second level of management in IBM, I never once saw a manager use a computer ... only their secretaries had them.  (Well, they had the computers but did not turn them on.)  Incidentally, people have not yet learned how to use voice mail ... they still leave messages like "call me".  And businesses use it to avoid customer contact, not enhance it.  So there are many reasons for the phenomenon of under used technology, I believe.<br></div>

The ivory tower computer scientists have long ago solved the problem of ill behaved software (Cf: Edsger Dijkstra or Donald Knuth).  However the economic incentives are to get the software out quickly and deal with problems later, mostly by charging the customer for "updates".  The "Vista Problem" will never be solved, I suspect.

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I agree that XP was eventually more stable.  Unfortunately, the way the system works in practice is that we are pushed along the "development' path decided on by the manufacturers.  DOS did not have the slick user interface Windows does, but it was only a few thousand bytes in size, ran on a very low power CPU, and did work.  Now, while CPU power is vastly increased, the size and efficiency of the Windows operating system sucks up that increase ... with no observable improvement in value to the end user.<br><br>I have found myself pushed along the path that others here have suggested.  I now use Firefox as my browser, even though some sites will only recognize IE.  I'm using Open Office or Google Documents over Word and Excel more often than I used to.  I love the connectivity of Outlook, OneNote, and IE ... that is the way things should work ... but first the programs have to WORK!  It takes forever for Outlook to do its housekeeping and then it hangs as often as not and OneNote on the PC will not talk to OneNote on Windows Mobile.  How nuts is that?  <br><br>As to choice, my last computer purchase removed the option of anything but Vista unless I wanted to pay for Vista (bundled with the system) then spend a few hundred more to buy a a copy of XP, which is becoming obsolete and would render my system unsupported by the manufacturer.  But that is how the game is played today.<br><br>Something has to change, but I can't see it happening.  By all accounts the soon to be released next version of Windows will be bigger and slower and manage to suck the life out of even quad core processors -- with no added value.  And it is not as if this is a new thing.  When IBM released its last version of OS/360, the new release had more bugs in it than it fixed ... so it started with VS, VM, OS/370, etc.  Sound familiar?  You'd think we'd learn.</div>

All the non-IE browsers leave a small footprint...I use four browsers due to having to do a lot of work on the internet. <br><br>here's my thoughts<br><br>For adaptability and work use: Firefox<br><br>If you use soial media (twitter, facebook etc): Flock<br><br>If you want speed and simplicity: Chrome <br><br>IE: just for going to sites that require IE. (and for checking compatibility issues if you run a website)<br><br>Opera....I used to love this, all its perks are covered by the former set for me.</div>

<div class="content">AFAIK (and from my own limited experience with it) Firefox has always been a memory hog. There are known 'memory leaks' in the program that were never fixed. If you're used to not restart your computer for weeks and keep tons of tabs open, the behaviour of Firefox isn't acceptable.<br><br>I used to love Opera. Great features, speed, low system requirements. <br><br>But then there was version 9.5. It introduced a lot of new features I hadn't ordered, did not fix some long-standing bugs, but introduced new ones (e.g. printing became horrible), had some stupid design decisions (like saving in .mht by default with no way to change that. And did I mention all those bugs?<br><br>Plus, a huge disadvantage of Opera has always been that a lot of web sites (esp. of the "Web 2.0" kind, like Gmail, Google Calendar, but also a lot of forums) don't work right with Opera. I rely on some of these web sites, so I stopped using O.<br><br>I finally settled on K-Meleon, which perfectly disguises as Firefox (so all web sites work) - it uses the same Gecko rendering enging - but it's faster and uses less RAM. However, development ist slow. <br><br>On my Mac, I use Safari (built-in) and Camino (another Gecko browser).</div>
