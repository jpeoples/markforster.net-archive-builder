<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I have been having issues remembering where I am up to. I am using your suggestion of putting a dot next to an item I have committed to starting. However, I also find that I can lose track of which page I was on following an interruption or when starting a new day.<br><br>I know I could use a simple book-mark. Instead though, before I start to scan a page I put the date at the top of the page - I use a very simple format eg for todays date I would put "16/1".Before I move onto the next page I put a line through the date to signify I have completed that page.<br><br> I have done this for 2 days and it has helped me tremendously. I also get the bonus of knowing when I last visiteid a page and I will be able to track just how many times I visit each page which will be useful I think as my beta testing progresses.<br><br>I appreciate this is a mod and I may not continue it indefinitely. Right now though it is helping me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andy<br><br>I had this trouble until I just numbered my pages. I guess if I get very distracted I might forget which page I was on but this very rarely happens. Anyway, it worked for me and once numbered you don't have to do anything else to them (no crossing out and rewriting).</div>

<div class="content">I use a Moleskine notebook with the built-in ribbon bookmark.  I never move it except when I advance pages.  For pages facing each other, I can pretty much remember the last thing I finished, so finding what page it's on is easy.</div>

<div class="content">Andy:<br><br>If you adhere to my latest amendment about using index cards for urgent items (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/629549#post631568" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/629549#post631568</a> ) you can use the index card as a bookmark.</div>

<div class="content">I suggest you also see my post in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/630753" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/630753</a> regarding use of paper clips as bookmarks</div>

<div class="content">Post-it notes (Stickies) are great for this.  I use them to mark my "last page" (where new items go), as well as marking the page and the item I'm currently working through.</div>

<div class="content">I do something quite similar to what Seraphim does.<br><br>I use some small plastic stickies, I think that here in the US they are called "tape flags."<br><br>I put one flag on the oldest active page and one on the page where the new items go. I do not use one on the current page that I am working on. Instead, that is the page my notebook is open to.</div>
