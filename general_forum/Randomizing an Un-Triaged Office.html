<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2014-02-5 14:17</div>
<div class="content">I'm finally pulling ahead enough to look more than a few hours ahead and work on my little-and-often projects, but I'm not entirely confident there's nothing important hiding in my physical backlog. Something small that I put off, thinking I'd have time for it in a week or two, that I didn't get to, and now buried in the pile. Or piles that got combined when I needed desk space.<br><br>My todo list is a true catch-all. Urgent and important tasks are mixed with random thoughts best forgotten. Recording an idea or task quickly is more important than putting it on the right list. So insisting I do whatever I land on might make me do something that's currently unimportant.<br><br>Today's Plan<br><br>As usual, start by creating a list for the day. Be optimistic about important little-and-often projects, including working the backlogs, especially the untriaged ones. Be pessimistic about less-important projects. As the day continues, add to this page without worrying about how important the idea is.<br><br>Anything important on today's list can be done at any time, without rolling, especially things that I want to do every day but often put off (rehearse, work on backlog, exercise).<br><br>Yesterday's list becomes the last page on the main list. Yes, any unactioned tasks will now be written twice -- once on yesterday's page, and once earlier i n the list. If morning-me wants to do them, they're important, even if afternoon-me feels resistance.<br><br>Use today's page as a bookmark. Start counting on it, then continue at the last line worked in the main list.<br><br>As I count, watch for tasks that should be done sooner. Use common sense. This allows me to work on those important things that got buried. At the next roll, count as if I'd landed on the task I actually did.<br><br>If I land on a task that should be delayed (needs more alertness, or can do when tired, such as easy knitting for my classes), take the next line. This opening is for common sense, not avoidance. I'm worried that Mark's method of crossing-out this line and rewriting it at the end will be abused. This method keeps the older tasks on the older pages and keeps the pressure on them.<br><br>Sub-lists or piles are handled in whatever way feels right. Maybe a single line in the big list saying "do something from the sub-list". Maybe include the list as a page in the big list. Depending on the sub-list structure, roll again or do the oldest. (Email is easy to count. The big pile isn't.)<br><br>The email backlog gets special rules. It has a line on the day list, which expands to "five oldest emails fully dealt-with, and end the day with 10 fewer emails than yesterday". The desk pile is harder to measure, so "end today shorter than yesterday" is harder to confirm, but that's the goal.<br><br>We'll see how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">Discovery: I really don't like hiding files for open projects. I have a good-quality fling cabinet beside my desk for open projects, but I put those files on my pile rather than in the cabinet.<br><br>There's no reason to think I'll forget about the projects. They each have a line in my list. They often have several lines, if it's easier to write ideas in my big list than open the folder. (Yes, that means doing the project means reading my list to pull out the ideas. Makes it harder to grab the file and travel, but I rarely do that anyways.<br><br>This is a habit I need to break rather than accept. Those files form a large part of my pile, obscuring other things. It's difficult to pull files out of the pile when I'm ready to work on them. It's hard to add papers to the files.</div>

<div class="content">I only rolled once, after I'd gotten bored with my day list.<br><br>It landed on random idea for a much-dreaded and important project, so I spent the rest of the day more-or-less in flow for that project. I didn't finish my little-and-oftens for the day, which is a problem, but I think any system that made me do that project before I used up my energy for the day, and let me take advantage of flow for it and get to a good stopping point, would have the same problem.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>When that happens to me, I consider it good fortune.  Getting in a flow pattern with any job that's important and especially dreaded is a coup!  When that happens I just do the the unavoidable daily stuff and let the rest wait. At least for me, sometimes I do things daily that can easily wait just to keep the habit and not allow things to get behind.  I'd rather have finished a huge project than sweep the house, clean the bathroom, clean the kitchen, vacuum, process the emails, mails, etc.  If there are no ticking bombs, then it can easily wait.  Only we know that we didn't mop or sweep the kitchen. It's not visible. Most emails, phone messages and mail aren't same day urgent. I've learned to become way less guilty about letting things wait a day or two. If you were away for the weekend, it would be the same thing except clean the dishes, counter and stove.  Stuff doesn't pile up nearly as quickly as we were taught.  When I was married I went on strike for an entire week because I was tired of him leaving stuff around.  After a week I asked him if he noticed anything different about the house.  I could see his nervous expression and the wheels furiously turning in his head.  He nervously blurted out, "Honey, the house looks lovely!  Did you clean it?"  I was flabbergasted!  It turns out that he was raised in a messy home so he actually didn't notice any difference.  By comparison, it looked very clean to him!  Lesson learned: Most people don't notice the little details that bother us!</div>

<div class="content">My problem is some of those things really should be done often to make progress. When my daughter went to karate twice a week, she made progress. When she went only once a week, she only maintained.<br><br>But, yeah, cleaning the bathrooms can wait another day, within reason. The kitchen can wait until there's no room on the counter. (It's a small counter). The email backlog doesn't need tackling until just before it's scary big. As long as I put in a load or of laundry each day, and make good choices about what I wash (kids' clothes needs faster turn around than the sheets), there's no reason to clear the hamper. (A daily load is easier than many in one day. As long as it's in before 3, my son does the rest. Many in one day means I have to set a timer and keep it moving.)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>I totally agree.  When my back is up against the wall for awhile with pressing jobs, I just have to settle for maintenance vs progress on other jobs. For me anyway, I have an idea of the rate of progress but when I have to freeze it for awhile, it's disappointing even though it can't be helped.  What angers me worse is when I let something slide for awhile out of sheer laziness and stupidity.  LOL!  You're taking care of a family plus many other interests and obligations.  You should give yourself more credit.  It sounds like you're accomplishing a lot.</div>

<div class="content">I have recently noticed my own tendency to leave open projects out rather than hiding them, so I'm interested to see that you've noticed it as an issue and want to break the habit.  <br>At home it's a problem because I start many craft projects and slowly eat up my space to work on them by leaving half-completed things out.  I need to work more on completion before starting new stuff and I'm trying to arrange for semi-open storage so things go away without me forgetting about them.<br>At work, I've been moved into a much smaller workspace.  There is no room for the stuff I would have said was my minimum work footprint (I work on 17 inch by 22 inch sheets of paper a lot), much less anything extra.  My habit of leaving files in progress out is over, no matter how I feel about it.  <br>I'm lucky in that all of my work projects are pretty similar so I already have a checklist sheet for completing them.  The plan is to have a checklist for each open project, keep the checklists well-updated (with post-it additions if necessary) and on a clipboard that I lean behind my monitor.  Then the files are off the desktop but a physical representation of the project is present for me to shuffle and handle and be reassured that I haven't forgotten something.<br><br>In spite of this habit, I don't feel like I'm a very visual person - I believe I'm a very verbal thinker instead.  Most of the organizing advice for visual thinkers seems like more overhead than I want to bother with.  Cricket, do you feel that you're highly visual?</div>

<div class="content">Hi R.M. Koske<br>I can't answer for Cricket, but I am highly visual. My thoughts are primarily visual and visceral which I have to translate into language.  I've trained myself to use lists but it takes a bit longer to read it to create the picture and then think what's next. My semi-solution is to have a basic projects/categories list.  If it's a project that isn't entirely intuitive, I'll write the next step on a post-it note or write a clue of what I'm trying to do. Sometimes a blank canvas stalemates me because I don't have any sort of visual clues in my head. If there's no deadline, I'll actually leave the canvas out to prompt me to think about it.  If it has a deadline, I'll just start working on it blind to see what happens.  LOL!  Without realizing it, I do that with many types of projects.  My friend was visiting and she asked me "Why has that pile of studs been in your living room since last week?  Why don't you put it away?"  I answered that I leave it out to cue me to make a final decision about how I want to install some walls in my attic.  LOL!  When I finally felt a decision brewing, I just pulled out the graft paper and started planning.  If it was on a list, I'm sure that the idea would have been slower to come.  LOL!<br><br>For some reason, I can write office work on a list, no problem but not creative projects or other things.  When I used to run and rain was expected, I'd place my running shoes in front of the toilet so it would be my first thought.  Otherwise, I might have time to think of an excuse to avoid the rain.  LOL!  I don't know why it's like that for me.  I could have written "run in the rain on my bathroom mirror" but the actual shoes are a better cue.  Their history quickly reminds me of why rain shouldn't deter my plan.  That's just the way my quirky brain works.  I even use music and sketching to pump my brain.  I don't know why these things spark my brain much better than reading words on a list or outline.  Go figure.</div>

<div class="content">I'm highly visual. My aural comprehension is good, but my memory of things I hear is weak unless I go over it again. It might be that when I read, I automatically go over important bits again, without realizing it.<br><br>I've never attempted to rely on my memory for dates or assignments. My parents made writing things down easy. Grocery list and pen by the fridge. Calendar and pen by the phone. They gave me DayTimers (in the format I chose) as part of my school supplies. They told educational stories about friends and coworkers who didn't learn to do these simple things.<br><br>One of my work terms had a "clear desk" policy. I followed it without difficulty, and enjoyed my desk. Unfortunately, it didn't stick.<br><br>My "big pile" problem is made worse when I clean my desk. I get mad, or optimistic, and throw everything in a single pile with the promise to actually deal with it.<br><br>I know enough to keep anything that will need attention in the next two weeks easy to find, even four weeks if holidays are coming up. I have a folder for bills, and one for accounting, and each urgent projects, so I can do them without touching the pile. Sometimes, though, I'll put things for a non-urgent project in the pile, and then the project becomes urgent.<br><br>I can usually clear the current pile in a week or two if I spend 30 minutes a day doing the 5 oldest things, but that takes time and discipline, and when it gets close to finished something else becomes more important.<br><br>Now, roll the die. 18. That gives me email backlog.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br><br>"Now, roll the die. 18. That gives me email backlog."<br><br>LOL!  The randomizer really helps, yeah?  <br><br>I miss music so much.  I studied it and dance for decades. Music can be so rapturous. I had to give all of my instruments away because of the disabilities. Also, I can't feel it as intensely as I used to.  Worse, I can't remember it as well either.  Still, I love how it makes me feel.  It still can pump my brain and energize my body.  LOL!  <br><br>For paper work, I categorize things like you but I use color coding. That way I can instantly see the folder's location by the color.  (Thanks, Mark for the lever arch files idea.)  I try to keep my files ordered with my current action files up front.  I used to LOVE having files crisscrossed in piles because it was so easy to keep and identify.  Now my brain just sees it as a indistinguishable pile of papers.  I can't remember how I piled them like I used to.  Now I have to take the extra bother to color code them so that I can identify them except incoming mail.  LOL!  8-10 pieces of mail isn't going to stump me.  LOL!<br><br>I envy you when you state that you can just tear through those piles so quickly.  I used to be pretty good at that.  My dad was visual also.  He had a six foot high shelf by his desk that were neat piles of paper that he was currently working on.  He liked being able to see them all at once like an overview.  LOL!  I was fine with just crisscrossing the paper piles.  LOL!  He was more OCD perfectionistic than I ever was.  LOL!<br><br>You stated:<br>"and when it gets close to finished something else becomes more important."<br><br>LOL!  I do that also sometimes.  When I've done enough of something boring, I switch to something less onerous.  LOL!  Of course, I tell myself that I have to cut the vegetables or some such thing RIGHT NOW.  The finances will hold for awhile.  *I know that I'm lying to myself.* I really just need about an hour away from paper purgatory.  Thanks for making me feel less guilty about it.  If you need to do it also, it can't be that damning.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the answers, Cricket, Learning.  I could be more visual than I think - I'm not afraid or generally unconfident in artistic creation.  I feel like I have a decent eye for color, balance and design, and I make costumes and crafts and have for years.  I'm not remotely as visual as Learning describes, though.  I think things through best by talking to myself about them.<br><br>When it comes to organizing my thoughts, words on paper work stupendously well for me.  I've tried making mindmaps, and honestly I'm either doing it super-wrong or my brain just isn't wired like that.  I finish, and I feel like I got nothing out of it that I wouldn't have gotten from a straight list, and gotten it faster with less effort.  I've told myself for a while that I'm not a visual thinker and was surprised to realize that I had this highly visual habit.<br><br>I don't know if my aural memory is very good or not - I haven't really thought about it.  I do seem to remember things I've been told that other people forget.  So maybe it is good.  (But often those things they forget are reductions in fiddly work overhead tasks - of COURSE I remember those!  One less thing to do!)  <br><br>I do not rely on my memory for doodly anymore though because health issues have started giving me brainfog.  (Which means I really really appreciate your posts about how you manage your physical and mental energy, Learning.)  My fear of forgetting comes from the fog and because my projects are so very routine that I didn't have any kind of setup for managing them for a long time.  I'd finish everything but one detail from that needed to come from someone else, then the detail would slip my mind and I'd think it was finished and panic when I discovered that it wasn't.  The checklists and better habits of noting issues and waiting-for items has fixed most of it, but the fear of forgetting remains.</div>

<div class="content">Learning, don't give up music just because it's now harder for you. There are tons of studies about how it helps integrate different parts of the brain and body and emotions.<br><br>My teacher regularly has students place in the top 5% of the country on the standardized exams, and all of her students who want to study music in post-secondary get in. She also teaches some developmentally-delayed students, the local youth choir, a church choir (auditions not required), an 85-year-old who sings to help her asthma and refuses to come to the group lessons, and me (who sings at the group lessons and forces herself to do exams but won't sing at recitals).<br><br>One work term, I put the folders in a tray with the folded edge out. I've tried that since then, and realize that that term was unique in the low level of paper generated.<br><br>RM, I can't seem to use mind-maps, either. Some of my notes get close to them, but I prefer lists with lots of space to the side for extra notes. I like to clearly see what order to read them in. (In museums, I work around the walls in order, and read all the labels. I try to let the art draw me in and guide me, and love it when it works, but those labels feel important.)<br><br>Check out FlyLady's systems. She's a big fan of checklists, flexibility, and routines. She's also a fan of little actions done often, doing things "well enough", and adapting her system to fit your situation. I don't follow it exactly, but I've incorporated many of her suggestions.<br><br>I usually contact people as soon as I realize I'll need their help, even if I won't need it for several weeks. With my luck, they'll be in Florida that week.<br><br>I put notes on my calendar for follow-up, usually in one of the blank days. (Now that I'm trying electronic again, I need to have a different system. I don't see that un-crossed-out box every day of the month.) I use the blank pages at the end of the book for the next several years.<br><br>There's a note in January to look into the annual Community Calendar, even though the deadline is always around February 21. It takes that long for me to review how many words and the type of ad, and confirm with the storytelling group what we'll do over the next year. I have a note this month to contact the psychologist about her waiting list (sometimes 18 months) about tests my son needs in two years. When a doctor tells me to follow up I write a note for about 6 months before, "ears, 5yrs, last Jan/09". Yes, I make appointments 6 or even 12 months in advance. I can always move it as the date approaches. If her schedule is so tight I can't move it, then if I'd not made the appointment early I wouldn't have one at all.<br><br>Even though I look far ahead often enough (next year's notes are still on a single page, so it's fast), I need to see "do this now" rather than "and for this deadline, I need to count back 6 weeks, which...nope, not this week...and for the next deadline..."<br><br>As the date approaches, the note moves to my week or day page.</div>

<div class="content">A note on calendars and tickler lists:<br><br>They are useless unless you have two habits. One habit alone is not enough.<br><br>1. Write things in it immediately. Carry it with you if at all possible. Get a size that fits your pocket or purse. Don't wait until you can get next year's at the dollar store, in December. Write next year's months on a sheet of paper if necessary, and have it with you now. If you can't carry it with you, at least carry a folded paper and move the notes to the calendar ASAP.<br><br>2. Check it often. Each day, look a few days ahead. Each week, look a few weeks ahead, each month, season, year....<br><br>If you aren't confident you've written everything down, you won't have a feeling of relief and confidence when you check the list.<br><br>If you don't check the list often enough, there's no sense writing things down.<br><br>Another tip is to make it fun. My former boyfriend never carried a date book because the ones he used in school were too big for his adult life. I gave him one that fit his pocket, and wrote something fun in every week (including some private jokes). He hasn't missed a date since, including the wedding!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>I agree on most counts but I don't carry my calendar or diary with me.  I write my out itinerary/agenda on an index card and my brief case if necessary. If I KNOW that I'm going to make another appointment, then I might job down the next few free days.  Otherwise, I simply tell them that I'll call them to confirm when I get home.  The less I carry with me, the better off I am.  The index card directs me and there's space to jot notes if necessary or paper in the brief case. <br><br>Each morning  I review and plan my day. I don't care about tomorrow while I'm out. LOL!  My calendar usually is reserved for hard deadlines and appointments or important events.  I use ticklers or lists for most of the other reminders and timelines. I usually time box my work outside of the calendar.  <br><br>I do understand the benefits of writing things down but because I can't trust my brain, I lean toward hypergraphia. I'm always shredding copious amounts of notes. I really shouldn't be as afraid. OTOH, my notes serve as excellent proof when people try to hoodwink me.  It adds credibility when I can say "At 1:32pm on Tuesday, February 04, you said.... Do you remember me having you slowly repeat what you said?  I wrote it verbatim!" That usually cuts the crap quickly.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">I often have to plan far in advance. My dentist makes follow-up visits 9 months away. Several groups schedule meetings two months away. It's faster for everyone to pull out their calendars and communicate at once than to email schedules over the next few days. If people are waffling and I want to move on, pulling out my calendar and asking for a date brings things to a head nicely.<br><br>Thinking I can remember something raises a red flag for me, that my brain isn't working too well at the moment, and I'll forget whatever it is I think I can remember. So if I think I can remember something, I immediately reach for the notepad. (Unless, of course, I'm too out of it to see and respect the red flag, in which case nothing will help.)</div>

<div class="content">Maybe (okay, probably) I need to let go of my definition of a visual thinker - I use lists the way you do, Cricket.  The list is effectively the visual that lets me get things done.  Flylady's in-depth stuff is overwhelming for me, but I do find her ideas to be extremely helpful.  <br><br>I once switched doctors because I needed a once-a-year checkup but the office wouldn't make appointments more than 3 months out.  I HATE and procrastinate making phone calls to make appointments, even for un-fraught stuff like an oil change.  I was only seeing that doc once every 18 months to two years because I procrastinated making appointments.  But an appointment made standing there after my last visit always gets attended or properly rescheduled.  <br><br>That may be part of why I have issues with following up at work - we agreed that someone else would finish a task and come to me, and I drop it from my mind because I hate dealing with approaching people.  I don't forget things I have to deal with or wait too late for them to do their part - my issues are always with people who know what they're supposed to do and haven't finished or gotten back to me.  I'm fussy, I'm anxious, and I'm afraid of nagging people who are helping me, so if I can make  getting in contact into a task that someone else initiates, I'm very happy.  Unfortunately, that's not the effective way to handle it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi R.M. Koske<br>re: you last paragraph...I know of what you speak! My sympathies are with you and anybody else who gets roped into working with apathetic or unqualified people.<br><br>Having to chase down an excuse making do not is far worse than most jobs!  I'd rather spend 10 -12 doing a report than spend 5-10 minutes once a week for weeks chasing down somebody who's either messing me up because they aren't doing what they're supposed to or politely assuring me with sugary lies or weak, lying excuses!

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Maybe the doc's assistants can't book too far ahead because the physician hasn't yet decided how to break down and book his 2 months in vacation time.  LOL!  The first year our family went on vacation together was when Dad left the military.  He NEVER took off work.  As a civilian surgeon, they FORCED him to take off 2 months a year.  At first, he was like a fish out of water but we loved having him on vacation with us.  They said it was for his well being and job performance.  (The truth was probably that the other docs didn't want to look bad on the company's books.)</div>

<div class="content">I don't like following up with people, but it's something I've learned to do. One of the few times "I'm the only one who can do things right" mentality actually helps. I'm the only one who can keep this project on schedule, and to do that I have to manage other people's time.<br><br>There's a difference between checking in every day, and checking in at key times. Calculate when they need to start working on it in order to keep you comfortable. Include their vacation, time for them to get sick, and time for you to get more from them if needed. On that date, ask them if there's anything they need and judge their reaction. Tell them you need to plan your month, and ask them when you can expect their part. Tell them why their deadline is shorter than they think. "I need it by Monday, because I'm traveling Tuesday and can't work on it then." (I was caught by that. He told me the deadline for the paper, but not that he needed two months to analyze the data I was collecting. In hindsight, I should have asked earlier.)<br><br>That works with unorganized or overloaded people, not apathetic.<br><br>Stever Robbins at Quick and Dirty Tips describes an issues log<br><a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/project-management/tame-your-projects-with-an-issues-log" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/project-management/tame-your-projects-with-an-issues-log</a><br>that makes status meetings much shorter. The format forces the team to assign an "owner" to each issue, and give very short report on each open issue at each status meeting. The challenge I found as a young employee, though, when asked for short status reports, was I didn't want to admit to anyone, including myself, that I didn't have everything under control.<br><br>As for doctors who won't make appointments a year in advance, I ask the receptionist when I should call, and that goes on the "far future" section of my purse calendar (aka the back cover, if the printer doesn't include a page.) "ears, 2yrs, last Jan/09." If I don't see the specialist every 2 years, I go on the very long waiting list for new patients, or have to find a specialist with a shorter list and transfer my file.</div>
