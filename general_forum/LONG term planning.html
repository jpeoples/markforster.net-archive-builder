<div class="content">I thought I would query the AF "hive-mind" about your experiences/recommendations regarding long-term planning. <br><br>Have you made a long term plan?<br>What term? (5 yrs? 10 yrs?)<br>How did you do it? What tools did you use?<br><br>Does anyone have any recommendations for reading material, links, or tools that might help in this department?<br><br>Any and all advice and/or observations will be appreciated! Thanks!<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">This is THE book to read on the subject:<br><br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Control-Your-Time-Life-Signet/dp/0451167724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1252590664&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Control-Your-Time-Life-Signet/dp/0451167724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1252590664&sr=8-1</a><br><br>As to tools, use pencil and paper and take a long time doing it.  My first plan took a week before I was half satisfied with it ... then I polished it over the next year or so.  But it has lasted a lifetime.<br><br>Don't look for sexy "tools" for this.  It is a dialog with yourself best conducted in quiet solitude.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Thank you for the book recommendation. I will check it out.<br><br>Re: avoiding tools, point well taken. I think I am more in the market for a guide or description.<br><br>How about it? Anyone else make a 5-yr plan? Any resources out there to help?<br><br>Thanks all,<br>Joseph</div>

The best advice I was given was to just acknowledge that when you are thinking about your mission and your goals, it can  sound really inflated, but just  accept that as part of the process. You not only can think big but should think big. Just that intention, aiming for something important, will bring very many benefits and as you achieve goals the next steps or stages will become clearer.

Why we sometimes accept it at "work" but resist it in our own lives is a mystery.</div>

<div class="content">This is a topic I have given a lot of thought to this year and in doing so have read several books, articles, blogs, etc as well as journeled, made lists, re-wrote lists...I found it is indeed a process! <br><br>One book that really helped me was written in the mid-80's and that I *accidently* ordered off Amazon. It is called: Time Power by Charles R. Hobbs. It really helped me identify my real values and how to translate that into goals. He just explained it in a way that no one else had. (I thought I was buying Brian Tracy's book by the same name--who, btw, also has some great material on this and related topics).<br><br>Here is the url to Time Power on Amazone: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ljjefv" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/ljjefv</a><br><br>I especially enjoyed that this was written pre-internet/electronic age as it somehow felt more "pure". Don't know quite how to explain that. Btw, he was a major early advocate of Day Timer and I believe his endorsement of the system is part of why it was such a success, at least initially.<br><br>One other thing. The 2nd part of the book is about his approach to time management and I didn't find that quite as valuable as the 1st part about life goals and such.<br>~Beth l</div>

<div class="content">I have actually been working on an ebook on this, as it is another thing like time management where I find I need to develop my own system and then get to work. <br><br>I do recommend Brian Tracy's book Goals.  He has you do an interesting exercise where you write 10-15 of your goals in a spiral notebook every day for 30 days.  The key is you do not look at the prior day.  By the end of 30 days the ideas is that your true goals are then firmly planted in your mind.   There is also advice as to how to achieve goals which was pretty basic, but I found this to be a unique method of identifying what is important in your life.  <br><br>I think i actually got a free pdf version of the book from his site, but it also available at libraries if you want to see this part.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Joseph,<br><br>You will find  reference to the book "The Best Year Yet"  by  Jinny Ditzler  in past comments in this forum. BYY works for me.   <a href="http://www.bestyearyet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestyearyet.com/</a> They offered the program online for years, now you have to pay. I also bought the book.</div>

<div class="content">Hello people,<br><br>Thanks for your ideas.  I have not yet made my own mission statement, or at least made one a few years ago in my 7habits time but lost it ^__^.  However I realized that I do need long term life direction on reading this thread, so I made one again.  Thanks Liz for the link, it was very helpful.  And thanks y'all for all your ideas.</div>
