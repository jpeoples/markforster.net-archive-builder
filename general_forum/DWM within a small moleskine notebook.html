<div class="content">I went through AF1 to AF4 using the moleskine pocket book (about 9 X 14 cm). I liked it: very small, can be carried everywhere, and it's a pleasure to read through the tasks. <br><br>With the appearance of DWM I was quite reluctant to switch because I had to move to a calendar. After some time I gave it a try. For a couple of month I used an A5 calender with one page per day. After some time, I noticed that I used it less frequently than I should. It didn't feel as "intimate" as the small book, it had a lot of empty or rarely filled pages between full pages, and it was too big to be carried with everytime. I started a try with a A5 ring binder with  4 sections for the coming 4 weeks to avoid the many empty pages - but it didn't feel right.<br><br>Thus, a couple of weeks ago I started again with a moleskine pocket book. Problem: How to deal with the expiry dates and the two entry points (one-week-from-now, four-weeks-from-now)? And how to avoid leaving much space which is not filled in the end?<br><br>My solution is as follows:<br><br>At the 4-weeks-from-now entry point I only fill the pages by half (or less). The top part of each page is used, the bottom part is left open. Tasks which go at the 1-week-from-now entry point fill the bottom part of the pages. If a page has been completely filled, its expiry date is set to 7 days. Thus, a task entered at the 4-weeks-from-now entry will get its expiry date only when the 1-week-from-now entry has reached and filled the page.<br><br>And I found a very easy way to deal with days without activities: I start every active day with adding a bar to each active page which is completely filled. All those pages which get the eighth bar are subject to dismissal. On days where I have no or almost no time to work from the list, no bars are added to the filled pages - thus they can live one day longer.<br><br>As a result, I have my compact notebook back, and I am working according to the basic princeples of DWM. Works great for me and brought me back on track.</div>

<div class="content">Correct me if I'm wrong...<br>Does it mean you use 4 pages for one month?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Wowi, <br><br>I also like using that size of Moleskine pocketbook.<br><br>When I was using DWM, I wrote bthe date in the top RH corner of each RH page, work tasks from the top down, personal from the bottom up.  Every day the first thing I would do would be to enter the latest 28th day (once I'd entered the first 28 from scratch).<br><br>I also ran into the problem of mainly empty pages.  The LH page of the current date was used to jot down tel numbers, email addresses, petty cash spent etc.<br><br>I've now returned to AF4, but using an element of DWM - see my reply to Erik's thread on 28 day months.<br><br>This time my AF4 book is an A6 ADOCS (like Rollabind) notebook with the advantage of being able to move pages around.  The pocket book has some nice coloured dividers in which reside my checklists, LTBW, Grasscatcher etc.<br><br>But I still have my Moleskine pocket notebook.  Although my AF4 notebook is usually with/near me, I'm experimenting using the RH page per day for MITs (Most Important Things), with work from the top down, personal from the bottom up.  In between the two sections - I try to keep MITs to 3 or 4 to retain focus (the AF4 checklists will look after some of the other stuff!) - I write any tasks done that came out of the blue.<br><br>I use the LH pages again for various notes as before, maybe even an item to go into the AF4 notebook if I don't have it with me.<br><br>And it's all using pen and paper except for Outlook appointments, task time blocks and some reminders - only Outlook has a backup though!</div>

<div class="content">Erik:<br>No, I used one section per week - but I could add pages if necessary. Normally that means 3-4 pages per week. In my new setting, there is no weekly section any more, I just move with the two entry points into the future and give any full page behind the 1-week-from-now entry point its expiration date. Depending on the ratio of tasks entered at the end and at the middle entry point, I sometimes skip a page at the 4-weeks-entry point to keep roughly the 3-weeks distance between the two entry points.<br><br>Roger J:<br>I have not really understood how your system works, but it seems that you only enter tasks at the end of the list (then identifying the date of dismissal - that's what I have understood from the other thread). My problem was to keep the entry point for active tasks in a fixed notebook without sticking to fixed pages per day. But what is true: if there is a possiblity to move pages around and to add pages in the middle of the book, then the situation is much easier to handle.</div>

<div class="content">Wowi: yes, I enter new or rewritten tasks at the end of the list.<br><br>The only 'break' comes with the start of each day which is when I write the date plus the dates for 21 and 28 days afterwards.  This is an attempt to know when tasks have entered the last week of their 'validity' a la DWM.<br><br>When the actual date gets to the oldest 21 day, I highlight it and have a look at any tasks still open from the original entry date,<br><br>A bit of a hybrid, but I don''t have fixed pages per day and my list is no longer scattered over several pages..<br><br>Apologies for any typos, power outage here in Damascus, I'm finishing this off via  pen-clip torch with small flexible LED to light the keys.  Yes, I am a bit of a gadget geek, bet I'm not the only one on this forum!</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>@wowi:<br><br>You have a very interesting DWM implementation there! I like it.<br><br>I like it so much, in fact, I am going to steal, err, borrow your method to make an AF tweak ^__^<br><br>Thank you so much!<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Wowi,<br>Your "non-fixed pages" tweak for DWM on moleskin pocket book is a keeper. Thanks. I added it to my <a href="http://www.delicious.com/sabre23t/dwm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.delicious.com/sabre23t/dwm</a> list. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Wowi - <br><br>Your system sounds intriguing but I'm not sure I understand it.  I've tried to re-state it in my own words, below.  Did I get it right?<br><br>(1) Don't date any pages<br><br>(2) Enter "new" tasks at the top of the first page that has some empty space in the top half of the page.  This is equivalent to the DWM "Today+28" entry point.<br><br>(3) Enter "recurring/repeat/continuing" tasks at the bottom half of the first page that has some empty space in the bottom half of the page.  This is equivalent to the DWM "Today+7" entry point.<br><br>(4) Every day you are actively using the system, the first thing you do is add a "bar" (a mark at the top of the page?) to every full page.  Eight bars means the remaining tasks are dismissed.   This would seem to mean that the "Today+7" tasks get a few more than 7 days, on average, before dismissal, but the "Today+28" tasks would have a widely variable amount of time to get dismissed, depending on your rate of filling up pages.<br><br>(5) You then cycle through the book, processing tasks.<br><br><br>Is this more-or-less correct?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br>Yes, you understand the system correctly (and explain it possibly better than I did). And you describe exactly the "lifecycle" of the tasks: The life of today+28 tasks are dependent on the rate of entries at the today+7 entry point: As soon as their page is filled by today+7 tasks, their expiry date is set. This date is not known from the beginning. Therefore, I have to observe a little bit the distance between the two entry points and add more or less tasks on one page at the today+28 pages.<br><br>The bar is a vertical line at the top of the page, the fifth line crossing the four previous ones. <br><br>sabre 23, nuntym: Thanks for your kind posts - I would be interested in your experience if you actually use that method. I think it's the first time that somebody bookmarks me at delicious ;-)</div>
