<div class="content">So while Dynamic DIT (find it at <a href="../general_forum/Dynamic DIT (DIT + SMEMA).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2110482</a> ) is still running great, these days I need to do a lot of online work - namely, building networked relationships, applying to jobs, and so on for my job hunt.  Problem is, it saps my energy immensely, especially with protracted research or applications.  How might I combat this so I can do what I need to do?</div>

<div class="content">Speaking about difficult or energy-draining tasks, never underestimate the power of timeboxing. There are many technics available - from Mark`s Get Everything Done to Pomodoro. Principle of timeboxing is so simple and powerful, that you can surely invent your own methods/implementations...</div>

<div class="content">I've realized that all tasks use a combination of 4 resources. Time, Money, Mental Energy, or Physical Energy.  Time is a resources thats always draining and can't be regenerated, whereas the other 3 can.<br><br><br>Time Resource Management:<br><br>I use decremental timeboxing for energy draining tasks or projects. I've written about it here:<br><a href="../fvp_forum/Timebox table- bursts of action and chain lengths etc..html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1842252</a><br><br>Physical energy resource management:<br><br>There's a time in the day that you have high physical energy. This is the best time to do tasks that are physical actions (obviously). For me, my peak time is usually 8am-lunch. then this resource feels like it drains really fast (probably the type of lunch I had, maybe I'm just not a pumped up anymore etc)<br><br>You can regenerate this resource by many ways. i.e. coffee, nap, sleep, water, healthy snacks, energy drink,vitamins, excercise etc.<br><br>Mental energy resource management:<br><br>Similarly, theres a time of day you have high mental energy/ high capacity to plan/think/ create/ brainstorm/be strategic etc. For me, my peak time is at night, 11pm- sleep, or when listening to music.<br><br>You can regenerate this resource by coffee, napping, sleeping, meditiation, walking, clearing your mind/ wrting everything on a sheet of paper etc.<br><br><br>Money Resource management:<br>I suppose a budget but generally you wan't to use the least amount of money to provide the highest impact towards the completion of an result/outcome/project/goal/task etc.<br><br>In all of these, I think the key is to identify where your tasks fall, determine your peak times for these resources and do the tasks requiring the most of it at those times.<br><br>Example:<br>workout--high physical energy<br>clean kitchen-low physical energy<br>organize files-low mental energy<br>rebudget household monthly mpayments-high mental energy<br>buy toothpaste-money (cheap)<br>buy treadmill-money (expensive<br><br>Obviously, I'm not saying to write this out, I'm but I'm saying to overcome energy-draining tasks, its a good idea to identify what is draining and what do you really mean by 'energy'.<br><br>I say this, because often, a task may take very long  or boring and because we are working on it for so long and its not fun eventually we are exhausted. But exhausted how? <br>Example: If you are studying for an exam, you'll be mentally exhausted (not so much physically)<br>If you are gardening for a long time, you'll be physically exhausted.<br><br>Anyways, thats it. I have a bad habit of wanting to write something short and end up rambling for a page.</div>

<div class="content">When I'm on a deadline and am pushing really hard, I use a "mindfulness bell," which makes me stop and take a breath (or three), then push on There's a great one at: <a href="http://www.fungie.info/bell/#" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.fungie.info/bell/#</a> I use the random one. Good luck to you in your job search. This is indeed one of the most energy draining of activities. Don't forget to network with friends, family, and everyone you know, because oft times, this leads to something that's not posted anywhere.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Maureen.  I'm focusing a lot on networking these days.  And me being reminded to shuffle those really big important tasks to early in the day helps generate momentum and energy.</div>
