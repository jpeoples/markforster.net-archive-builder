<div class="content">This is just a test post to see why my recent posts on a few topics never made it over the past few days, two weeks into a work assignment here in Damascus till end of April 2011.<br><br>Is the Syrian Big Brother stopping my posts, like it prevents FaceBook (not such a bad thing to ban?), new Skype etc , until I can find a working proxy here?  Is there a moderator on the forum who doesn't like me referring to Norman U as Stormin Forum Norman?  I can't imagine that!<br><br>If this post does appear, i will try commenting on it myself.</div>

<div class="content">You have to wonder about the degree of narcissism of someone who would start a thread and post a handful of consecutive comments without any word from someone else.</div>

<div class="content">Ben,<br><br>Norman did not do that.  He was just having fun with Andreas over his script that colored Mark's post green.</div>

<div class="content">Sometimes the Norman in Black option is good too.  Each of the best sense options has had it's moments.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I know he was just having fun. And I know he's just having fun now and his comment here is referring to his own massive solo thread he did earlier the same day. I'm just having fun too. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Stormin Forum Norman: thanks, for some reason I'm now able to post comments again.  You're lucky I was still having problems yesterday, I tried to reply about your magnum opus with its long sections giving no-one else chance until your creative juices dried up.<br><br>Who's the Narc now, apart from your neighbours? ;-))))))))<br><br>Syria a is great, I was here for a month this time last year, my wife and I agreed Damascus is the safest city we've visited, anywhere.  The people we've met are very friendly and now that I have a year ahead of me here, I plan to explore more of the region over weekends and holidays, IF the ash cloud over Europe goes away and lets my wfie join me next week.</div>
