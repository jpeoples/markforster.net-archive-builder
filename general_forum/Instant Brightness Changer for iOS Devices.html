<div class="content">If you use an iOS device late at night you likely dim the display and brighten it again in the morning. This can be tedious and repetitive and is easily remedied by the app linked below (which is free today).<br><br>You set your day and night brightness and whenever you tap on the app it opens quickly, toggles your screen's brightness and exits. I've since stopped using a jailbreak app which shortened the adjustment process but nowhere near as efficiently as this app has — and this app doesn't require a jailbroken device. Useful for working at night with white-background list apps that tend to act as a searchlight.<br><br><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quick-brightness/id523486711?mt=8" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quick-brightness/id523486711?mt=8</a></div>
