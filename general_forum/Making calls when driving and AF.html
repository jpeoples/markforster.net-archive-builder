<div class="content">When using GTD it was easy to make calls when driving. All my calls were grouped under @Calls context. With AF it's easier to DO but when you have all resourses by hand. Now when driving I feel I loose the time (4 hours daily minimum). Is there anyone like me? How did you solve that issue?</div>

<div class="content">You're still allowed to have a special @Calls list - and put "Calls" or something like that on your AF4 list.<br><br>A completely different and maybe a bit extreme example: I have "personal projects" on my AF4 list - and a list of these projects on my computer's wallpaper. When "personal projects" stands out, I pick whatever I want from this list and work on it - and I pick the next until I think it's time to go back to AF4.<br><br>Note: these projects don't contain external commitments, it's more of a scanner's list of stuff currently going on (see refuse to choose - I think it works similar to the rotating priorities board, but I didn't fully understand her explanation).</div>

<div class="content">People who are on the phone while driving should be locked up. Nothing you are talking about is that important.<br><br>Rethink the concept of "wasting or losing time".</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Norm.  I've seen quotes that cell phone usage is comparable to drunk driving in terms of the rate of accidents.<br><br><a href="http://www.cartest.ca/cell_phones_and_driving_late.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cartest.ca/cell_phones_and_driving_late.htm</a></div>

<div class="content">Another vote for concentrating on driving.<br><br>Any work while driving should be strictly subconscious. You can feed your subconscious a nice juicy problem before setting off, but then leave it alone while you concentrate on the road and your fellow road users.</div>

<div class="content">Use of a cell-phone while driving is illegal in the UK, unless it's a proper fixed carphone. But even then it's reckoned to be just as distracting.</div>

<div class="content">To summarize, if AF makes it harder to make calls while driving, that's not a bug, it's a security feature. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">As I don't drive myself, I don't think it would be appropriate to say anything about phone calls while driving. Therefore: please don't read my answer as an encouragement to do anything distracting while driving.</div>

<div class="content">It's also illegal to use a mobile while driving in Ireland unless it is a properly installed 'hands free' system. I have such a system, as I spend six hours driving on Monday and Friday. I HATE having to make calls while driving - I much prefer listening to podcasts, audible books and relaxing music.<br><br>I often make short lists on my blackberry for those times when I am away from the desk and not easily able to refer to my A4 notebook - shopping lists - lists of calls to make - list of things to bring from A to B etc. My AF pages are always the authorative 'master list', so I update them later when I get back to my notebook.<br><br>I also use my blackberry to note items that occur to me while in transit - adding them to my notebook later. The voice recorder on my phone is very handy for capturing tasks and ideas while driving.<br><br>What has NOT worked for me is putting the entire AF list on my blackberry - the moment the list becomes electronic I seem to spend more time sorting and slicing the list instead of actually doing anything. The inflexability of the written list seems to be a boon to me instead of a hindrence.<br><br>Respect<br>Paul</div>

<div class="content">Hey, come on people! Driving for four hours a day and NOT making any phone calls is criminal. Of course you should have proper hands-free equipment when doing it - which also makes it perfectly legal, at least here in the Nordic countries.</div>

<div class="content">Hands-free systems have not been shown to be much safer than your typical cell. <br><br>There is no reason why you cannot pullover and make a phone call.<br><br>Other than safety, I think a larger question is why do we feel we have to constantly be in contact with others and unable to focus on a single task, especially one as potentially dangerous as driving.</div>

<div class="content">Here in Russia we can make calls while using hands-free when driving. So I appreciate your inputs regarding dangerous moments it could cause and again request any tips and advice of how to use AF for making calls on the road. :)</div>

<div class="content">I remember reading somewhere that there are two types of people when it comes to using a cellphone while driving. There are those who visualise the person they are speaking to - and their likelihood of having an accident is greatly increased. And there are those who don't visualise the person they are speaking to - and they are no more likely to have an accident than they are when not using the phone. It doesn't matter whether the phone is hands-free or not.<br><br>Unfortunately I can't quote a reference to this. But the message seems clear. If you tend to visualise the person you are speaking to, you shouldn't use a cellphone in a moving vehicle under any circumstances.</div>

<div class="content">Eugene:<br><br>According to the article, if I remember right, it's a question of personality and not easily changed. Basically you either are or you aren't a person who visualises during phone conversations.</div>

<div class="content">I find talking on the phone (using the hands free system) is no more distracting than talking to a person who is in the car with me. In fact - on a very long journey I fond having a conversation every now and then HELPS me stay alert and focused. Several hours on the motorway with nobody to talk to can make me tired.<br><br>Maybe I am rationalising. I do prefer to listen to music or an audio-book but notice that I am more alert after a lively conversation.</div>

<div class="content">As Mark says, it is a function of the kind of person you are.  If it helps ...<br><br>I'm a very visual person.  My internal experience of carrying on a conversation while driving is a little like going blind.  My vision switches from external to internal and while I am internally visualizing I can't use my external visual sense properly.  I takes a close call or something to snap me out of it.  For me, this also applies to talking with my wife sitting next to me.<br><br>We have had numerous debates on this issue (let your imagination run wild here ;-) as she talks on her cell phone for almost all of her 2+ hours/day commute.  She is better able to drive than I, but I'm not convinced that she does not also suffer some degradation.<br><br>After thinking about it it seems as if it is a particular kind of conversation that causes me (at least) trouble.  It is one in which I must solve a problem.  I can chit chat about things with my wife but when she asks the best way to get where we are going, I'm in trouble.  My mind constructs internal maps and I start working on the problem and go blind.  The trouble is that I'm driving when I go blind.  No biggie if we are on a highway cruising, but if I need to make turns or am in stop and go traffic, it can be dangerous.  It drives her nuts ;-)  And for me, the ONLY time I am on the cell phone is when I am solving a problem.  I don't get on the phone for fun ... I HATE it ;-)  Like as not it will be my wife calling to ask what's for dinner and that takes thinking ... or my neighbor asking me to pick up some things while I'm at the big box store ... and then I'm memorizing a list.<br><br>It turns out that we are all able to work in all modes of thinking.  I am more extremely visual, but I am also somewhat auditory and a little bit kinesthetic.  You may say that you are primarily kinesthetic, but you DO visualize to SOME degree and when you are doing that, you are detaching (to some extent) from the external world.  It is probable that the auditory and kinesthetics also do, even when NOT visualizing.  My reasons for saying that are speculative but they comport with my personal experience.<br><br>As to "hands free" phones, it turns out that holding the phone is only a small part of the distraction and so there is a small movement here in the US to stop ALL cell phone usage while driving.  The thought is that the carriers could disconnect the call and refuse to allow new calls (send or receive) when it detects that the phone is in motion (via GPS or cell tower triangulation).</div>

<div class="content">"The thought is that the carriers could disconnect the call and refuse to allow new calls (send or receive) when it detects that the phone is in motion (via GPS or cell tower triangulation)"<br><br>For the passangers, too? Or like when sitting in the train? And what about people walking and talking; they tend to bump into things when doing that, don't they? Hey, I just realised that there's a solution for all this - it's called a landline phone.</div>

<div class="content">Eugene, I found out that the strict Autofocus system didn't work for me when trying to make calls while driving. Nowadays I use a combination of Autofocus and GTD where basically GTD takes care of the project planning part plus provides some necessary contexts (like 'calls', 'errands' etc.), and Autofocus provides the main 'working environment' in the form of a one list, which I work through in AF4 fashion.<br><br>This all is brought together by OmniFocus which allows me to have projects and contexts for the GTD part and a custom perspective for the Autofocus list (only next actions in chronological order like they would be on a written list). So, while sitting in front of my Mac I use the Autofocus list, where the calls are just normal tasks to be dealt with when they stand out, but when I'm out and about (or driving) I have my iPhone with the synced data from the Mac and I can just select the 'calls' context and work from there. Best of both worlds, methinks.</div>
