<div class="content">It fits well with AutoFocus too. The conventional wisdom to work one thing until it's done contrasts with this article which says work as it feels right.  It's a helpful reminder to relax. Instead of nose to the grindstone, it's nose 2 feet back from the grindstone as you continue working. Awareness of yourself and everything around you is extremely important both to decision making and working effectively. <br><br>Thanks for sharing!</div>

<div class="content"><<The conventional wisdom>><br><br>Unfortunately my interest in his matrial took a nosedive after listening to a podcast, where he describes how he conceived of Stillpwer. The gist: <br><br>My life was falling apart, I contacted Richard Carlson (Don't Sweat the...), he was too busy to see me, so he recommended his teacher/guru. After a few meetings with said teacher, I healed my marriage, emotional state, etc. I now believe you don't need medication or therapy, simply Stillpower to transform your marriage, mood, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Another case of drastic overstatement.  The article itself seems sound even if the rest of the work is outlandinsh.</div>

<div class="content"><<... it's nose 2 feet back from the grindstone as you continue working. Awareness of yourself and everything around you is extremely important both to decision making and working effectively.>><br><br>I once tried to convince someone very close to me that they needed to come up for air to actually get the job done.  I used the analogy of Newton's law:  The mutual forces of action and reaction between two bodies are equal and opposite.  My plea was for him to quit pushing against the wall so hard, because it is just going to push back (i.e., time to step back).  <br><br>The nose-to-the-grindstone-until-it-is-done method (especially if self-inflicted by procrastination) can just plain wear somebody out if they overdo it.  I believe that this can adversely affect some people a lot more than others, even make them sick.<br><br>Even if the Big Thing actually gets done, the benefit can be overridden if too much time is required afterwards just to recover and re-focus on everything that had been dropped or ignored.  <br><br>Thanks for this reminder.</div>

<div class="content">As in all things, either extreme is bad.<br><br>If you keep your nose to one grindstone, you'll wear yourself out, and all of the other grindstones will suffer -- especially those that only need a bit of work on a regular basis.<br><br>If you have too many grindstones and keep changing between them, you'll never finish any of them. Sometimes you need to focus on just a few and let the others sit. Some can be ignored for a long time, others need regular maintenance.<br><br>We also need to step back and look at the grindstone. I tell my husband to stop beating his head against the brick wall. There's probably a door just around the corner. Even if there isn't there's probably a window. Look through the window. Maybe it's not worth the effort of going inside in the first place.</div>
