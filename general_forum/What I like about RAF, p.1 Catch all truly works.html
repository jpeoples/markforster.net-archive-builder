<div class="content">I'll try to notch down all the things I specially like about my favourite TM-system, which is the one I am using: Real Autofocus? - Yes, please.<br><br>With RAF, catch all truly works. Prior to that Coming from a GTD background, I always liked the idea of "catch all" fundamentally. <br><br>It just was a problem for me in practice. I did manage to keep Autofocus lists short or GTD lists organised. But it still felt like a burden to manage all that. When "no list" appeared on the map, I was all for that and it really helped. But it also led me to have some other lists to manage, well, something. For instance a list of projects…<br><br>I also liked to plan ahead when using DIT, but this was always on a per-project basis and I was never quite sure when I had crossed the borders into cheating-land.<br><br>With GTD you had the "Tickler", essentially the same idea.<br><br>With RAF this is IMHO regulated the best way. I now look forward to checking out the calendar first thing in the morning after I drew the DDD line.<br><br>What RAF does so well, is to mitigate days were I had a lot of new ideas. On those days my list tends to get filled, but unlike with other systems, this doesn't lead to an ever growing list.<br><br>Instead, when DDD comes along, all those good ideas get nicely scheduled according to a perceived order of urgency (or better: ripeness, if that is a word) and that works quite well.<br><br>And off I go to another day with a list that caught it all and remained blazingly slim!<br><br>Ehr.<br><br>Yeah.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Christopher.<br><br>You've inspired me to stop fiddling around with other ideas - none of which have worked out - and go back and give RAF a real long-term trial.</div>

<div class="content">Christoper,<br><br>Thanks for your post<br><br>I want to ask you how you RAF:<br>Are using pen paper or digital / application?</div>

<div class="content">Glad to hear someone else is sticking with it. I'm about 50 days in, and haven't been tempted to change systems or even tweak the rules.  (Using pocket notebook & pencil.)</div>

<div class="content">Christopher,<br><br>You wrote: "When 'no list' appeared on the map, I was all for that and it really helped. But it also led me to have some other lists."<br><br>I used several of the no-list methods - mostly SMEMA - for considerable time, and I think the experience trained me to relax and not fret about always putting everything on the list (i.e. 'empty your head' in GTD parlance). After relative success with SMEMA, I realized that important things mostly get remembered and actioned at the proper time. But I also kept side lists - e.g. checklists for daily routines - and notes/reminders in a Tickler file. I still use the Ticker instead of a calendar when a rare Defer decision is made, but I prefer Delete or Do, knowing that I'll probably remember to reenter a Deleted task later, and that I can Do just a little if I want to then reenter immediately. <br><br>So although I'm really satisfied with RealAF, I wonder if AF1 or other earlier systems would've been more effective if I had tried them after the training experience of no-list. <br><br>Sorry to hijack your thread. I'll shut up now!</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Christopher, this is my favorite system. And like Ubi I've been using it non-stop for eight weeks. I still like it and look forward to using it each day. Here's a list I made a month ago:<br><br>	1. The list isn't growing 'uncontrollably' because I Do, Defer, or Delete every day. The list almost always only two days old.<br>	2. Defering makes me look at, and use, a calendar. I have to look ahead & think about how much can be done.<br>	3. It is helping me focus on doing one thing (project) at a time.<br>	4. What needs to be done is right in front of me, not strung out across pages.<br>	5. Weeding is routine and easy to do because the list is not overwhelmingly long.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster:<br><br>Thanks! You can imagine to receive such a feedback is somewhat thrilling to me.<br><br><br>@Nanda: <br><br>I am using a Moleskine or similar, I buy what I find fun at that moment. I use cheapish fiber pens. I find they flow best on that sort of paper.<br><br><br>@ubi:<br><br>Yes, the no-list schooling improved my handling of other systems, no question about it.<br><br>The thing is, with no-list you have a concentrated moment when you refill the list. With catch-all this is missing, so you tend to write more stuff down just in case.<br><br><br>@Zane:<br><br>Yes, I agree with some of your points, in fact I wanted to write about them in further installments of this min-series. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">@ubi: <br><br>A separate projects list of some sort as well as a catch-all list can denote when you split a project in several sub-projects that can be worked on simultaneously or whether you want to deal with the sub-projects sequentially (maybe turnwise).</div>
