<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2019-03-3 17:44</div>
<div class="content">The book "L’art de la Liste" <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lart-Liste-Simplify-organise-enrich/dp/1409182916/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lart-Liste-Simplify-organise-enrich/dp/1409182916/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8</a> ) by Dominique Loreau has broadened my ideas of what could go on myAF-style list(s) beyond a productivity focus. The author suggests that a semi-Buddhist model of simpler living can be encouraged by creating lists such as "what I'm drawn to", "my heroes", or "simple pleasures". I liked the minimalist approach to personal development via list-writing. It seems to offer an approach to mindfulness that may appeal to users of Mark's systems.</div>

<div class="content">Just received simplicite from the library, looks like good read. She keeps lists and note books.</div>

<div class="content">Contrary to the titles, these books are in English, albeit translated from the original. Until Erin responded I assumed Michael was being multilingual.</div>

<div class="content">About three quarters through L'art de la Simplicité: How to Live More with Less. Good ideas for those who want to pare down. It reads a bit odd, I attribute that to the translation. She sets a high mark for minimalism, ie. a few pots, eating from a small bowl and clothes that fit in a couple of suitcases. Sounds wonderful but I doubt I can/want to pare down that much.  The exaltation of Eastern thinking over Western is over done. Overall I’ve learned some good things. <br><br>I’ll check out Lists next.</div>

<div class="content">The “list” book is good. Two lists I made from it so far are “what I spend the most time on” and “me time”. So many ideas for lists. I can see she wrote the book from her lists.</div>

<div class="content">A list I recently made, in response to watching a TV-program on "bullshit jobs" was a list of activities that add value to my and other people's lives, and that I would like to do more of. Very motivational!</div>
