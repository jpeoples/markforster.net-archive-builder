<div class="content">While we're all debating the relative merits of DWM, I thought we needed a little levity around here.  <br><br>So... what's the task on your list that might look the strangest to an outsider?<br><br>Mine right now is probably "get up and move" because I pulled a muscle in my lower back and it gets really REALLY stiff if I stay in any one position (i.e., sitting) for too long.</div>

<div class="content">Mine would probably be:<br><br>"Standing"<br><br>"Hermeneutic"<br><br>or <br><br>"Bara Brith"<br><br>All recurring tasks.<br><br>P.S. Though the non-recurring task "Sort Out Phoenix" might take some explaining!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>In my freshman year, I took a literature course entitled something like "Interpretating the Bible as a Literary Work"  Would that qualify for putting hermeneutic on my DWM if I had one back in the Stone Age?<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br>ROTFL!  ROTFL!  ROTFL!  You made my day!  I could never do your job!  I guess there are many examples of bag of sh** excuses, hypotheses, pontificating throughout a typical day of campus life!  I tip my hat off to you!  I wonder if the guy at the tower on the Texas U. campus wasn't a frazzled thesis advisor or department head who's also on the panel reviewing grant proposals.  ROTFL!  (The actual tragedy wasn't funny..I'm simply using wicked humor....*blush*)<br>My hat's off to you for all that you do while managing to refrain from becoming a serial killer!  ROTFL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">These do all lead to entertaining speculation.  The ways that we abbreviate things might lend itself to some armchair psychoanalysis as well!</div>

<div class="content">I put a rather strange item onto my DWM list yesterday:<br><br>   "Don't let islands grow."<br><br>Yes, this really is something I need to do for work -- I'm currently manipulating GIS (map) data, and have to deal with polygons representing land masses and cities.  So it's not quite as insane as it sounds...<br><br> - Erik.</div>
