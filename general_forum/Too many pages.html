<div class="meta">2009-01-15 5:40</div>
<div class="content">I am finding that I am getting a large number of open, active pages.  I am up to 30 right now.  The first pages have about 25 items, but now I'm using 40 items per page.  It's a good mix of hard items, easy items, misc thoughts, one-off tasks, project tasks, work and personal.  <br><br>I can still move pretty quickly -- if I have all day to work on AF tasks, then I was going through the whole thing two or three times.  Yesterday and today, I only go through a few pages, since I was in meetings most of the day.<br><br>It does "feel" somewhat slow, however, and I definitely don't have a feel for the whole list fresh in my mind.  Besides that, however, it's actually working pretty well.  I guess I just have lots to do.  :-)<br><br>Any ideas on how to make it "move faster", or deal with the sheer volume of tasks?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Actually I have the same problem. Yesterday for example I was going round on the same page over and over again, since so many items stood out (and some of them were urgent actually). Sometimes I "force" myself out of a page to avoid leaving items on other pages untouched.<br><br>Mark, do you have any recommendations?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim<br><br>If the system is working correctly, the bulk of the "action" should be at the end of the list. The early pages are where slow-moving tasks are either picked off or sifted out.<br><br>I suspect that you are not using the "little and often" principle enough. In other words you are tending to work too long on an item before crossing it out and sending it to the end of the list.</div>

<div class="content">Christian:<br><br>if you have an urgent item which you need to leave the strict sequence of the list for, it is better to take action on it as an exception and then go back to where you were. If you "force yourself" out of a page to get to it, you will be reducing the power of the sifting effect of the system.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Re: Little and often.  Is that your "rule" for operating in this system, or a way of dealing with procrastination.  Seeing that last comment I'm now not sure.  My own preference is to work on an item until done.  In fact, I see working briefly on items and moving on to the next only to return later as a "problem" to be overcome.  Being a victim of ADD (or ADHD or whatever they are calling it now), focus has always been a problem for me ... since childhood.  I struggle to force myself to focus as much as possible so as to not degenerate into some kind of bug flitting from flower to flower.  I am always willing to drop what I'm doing in favor of the next shiny object.  So, for me at least, other than as a way of dealing with procrastination, "little and often" is not medicine, but rather poison.<br><br>Comments?  (And you might want to think seriously about this situation as I've noticed that those who look for these systems have a much higher incidence of ADD than is seen in the general population.  And what could make more sense?)</div>

<div class="content">Mike, interesting post.  I've had a few discussions re ADD/ADHD over the past year or so and have suspected for some time that that could have been part of my Time Management issues since childhood.  I have never been diagnosed with ADHD so that was/is pure subjecture, but I think the way I have always struggled with TM fits into that mindset (and why some of the ADD specific "solutions" have helped in the past.<br><br>I wonder about your comment "I see working briefly on items and moving on to the next only to return later as a "problem" to be overcome." Is that comment how you see things now or how you used to feel about tasks? It sounds like a "rational" comment and I can see from your other posts that you are experiencing the intuitive nature of AF. For me, the ability to break tasks down to smaller and less threatening entities, has always been a major key to progressing projects, although I have never managed it so effectively as under AF.  The advantage was/is that progress *can* be made in short burst, which has been great when I could not keep attention on things for an extended period.</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>Your comments above re where the bulk of the action should be, and forcing yourself out of lists are really helpful.  I am starting to experience those very things but my "AF intuition" was only just beginning to highlight that to me.  Your experience of what happens, and why, from the perspective of a longer time using AF is really valuable.  I fell that your insight has helped me to move forward in my understanding - and be even more productive :-)  Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>Well, the comment is rational as that is the only mechanism I have for thinking and writing ;-)  You are right about the intuitive nature of the system, and that is a big plus.  However, ADD has to be looked at in broader context.  IOW, it is not so much what works this minute, but what helps or worsens my ability to cope overall.  For those without focus problems, there is no "danger" in working on snippets.  But for those of us who DO have such problems, it is crucial to enforce discipline to keep focused or things just get worse over time.  Meditation, for example, has helped me tremendously as it is the hardest thing imaginable to sit still for three hours while keeping the mind from "moving".  And over time, the effort is rewarded with an increased ability to concentrate.  And obviously, that can't be effectively done in snippets.<br><br>As to an interest in time management systems in general, I think that it can almost be defined as a symptom of ADD ;-)  As I child I was much worse ... I could not even sit in my seat in school, my teachers just gave up and "sat" me at the back of the class so I could stand next to my seat as I needed to.  Over the years, I have developed many coping mechanisms.  Time management principles are just one (memory training, speed reading, speed math, meditation, aerobic exercise, etc. are others).  I got a huge bump in productivity when I started to simply write things down!  It sounds obvious, but the payoff for me was astounding ... and that is a direct result of ADD, as I see it.<br><br>My internal experience is that I live in an inner world (E5) and watch it go by.  In order to participate I have to "engage" and to do that, I have to exercise an act of will.  The problem is, that if I see some shiny object and am distracted, I often can't find my way back ... unless I have a LIST.  The whole point of a list is to help me know what I want to do.  Sounds crazy for those non ADDers, but we can get lost and forget to eat.  (I don't actually write "Eat Lunch" down ;-)  but I do have to remind myself that I've not eaten and if I don't eat now I'll be too hungry to last until dinner time then I'll eat too late to share dinner with my wife and go to bed too soon after eating and get acid reflux and ...  OY, what a mess ;-)<br><br>And this illustrates the flip side of the focus problem ... hyperfocus ... which is also part of ADD.  That is one reason I forget to eat lunch.  And we can't control when we lack focus and when we are in hyperfocus ... at least I have not found a way.  So I'm cautious of anything which disturbs my attempt to improve focus -- which the "little and often" principle can.<br><br>In fact, for me, the AF system helps keep me focused on what I have decided I want to do.  And it also helps me when I'm in hyperfocus mode ... there is some place I can go to shake it off and find something else that needs to be done.<br><br>I could say lots more, but I think this illustrates the main point about the sacredness of focus.  I'm all for breaking down tasks to make them "doable", but not to make them "short" just for the sake of shortness.  For me, that way lies madness.   ;-)</div>

<div class="content">That's a really helpful, insightful post Mike.  I guess the key to using AF to it's full extent for you lies in your last sentence "I'm all for breaking down tasks to make them "doable", but not to make them "short" just for the sake of shortness."  The trick will be in identifying where that defining point is for you .........<br><br>ps Like the meditation illustration - meditation in short bursts - hmmmmmmm.............. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Well I'm not an ADD person myself - I would have no problem sitting in meditation for 3 hours with a completely empty mind - but I have always regarded it as a plus that people with ADD find my various systems helpful to them. I don't think that brings the corollary that the systems are more suitable for people with ADD than those without. My experience with coaching, giving seminars, etc to literally thousands of people, frequently without preselection, is that just about everyone suffers from problems with managing their time in some form or another. There are exceptions and very often they are people at the top of the tree because of it.<br><br>To answer your specific question about "little and often":<br><br>No, this is not primarily a strategy for dealing with procrastination, though it is very effective at it. It is the way the mind and body prefer to work. We can see it with things like weight training. If you do a vast amount of work with weights once a week or less, you will be in serious danger of crippling yourself. It is much better to do a smaller amount three times a week. (I should say here that "little" is a relative term).<br><br>Another example is learning a musical instrument. If you have a once a week piano lesson, the teacher will tell you not to save all your practice up for the evening before the lesson, but to do a bit every day.<br><br>We can see it in language learning. It has been shown that per hour of working on the language it is more effective to do an hour or so a day than to attend a concentrated course. The learning here must be purposeful of course - just flitting around for an hour won't accomplish much.<br><br>If you work in this way, you get the advantage of "maturation". In weight training the increase of strength does not take place when you are doing the exercises, it takes place afterwards when you have stopped. Similarly in piano practice or learning French the learning is consolidated in the gaps.<br><br>You have probably noticed that if you are writing an essay or report that if you leave it overnight and come back to it you find that your ideas have advanced. We talk about sleeping on a problem to get a new perspective. That's "maturation" in action.</div>

I have habits of routine so that I don't have to decide over and over again. Plus, being responsible has been engrained in us since childhood.  Sometimes it's easier to get things done and stay current rather than having to refer to a list....at least for me.....<br>I only break things down to aide me or to effectively use some stray time.  (i.e. I'm dressed and ready to be picked up 30 minutes early. Rather than just sit, I'll knock out something I want to do.<br>i.e.  If I want to pay my bills all at once, where's the harm?<br>i.e.  Why should I have to take the time to write things on a list that are normal habits of living.  i.e.  Awake:  Make bed, personal care, walk dog to relieve herself.  Sweep and Mop floors, erase meds pad, start my Todo List (around my calendar and routines) or start my Day's routine  (I have most of my ongoing life matters broken down into routines similar to Flylady's Method )  Therefore, my day's list is usually only 1 to 5 things.  The rest is habitualized.  I also do the worst stuff (dictated either by pain load or lazy streak) first to get it out of the way.<br><br>This method leaves my mind free to be creative and at peace.  When I compose my daily short list, I'm aiming for completeness where I can, or little and often where I must.  With short term memory loss, decision making uses lots of mental energy which I'd rather use on creativity, gratitudes, social gratifications, etc...<br><br>People don't realize how much mental energy is used when making decisions.  Especially to be effective despite hard pain and soft memory (*blush*), I rely HEAVILY on habits.  My version of Autofocus would be my weekly review and composing my daily short list.  The rest is habitualized into my normal lifestyle.  (Being raised by a miliatry officer/surgeon might explain my comfort with ongoing order.  LOL!)<br>gsdsmiles</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I agree with the tasks you have listed there: language, music, etc.  However, all of those examples are building proficiency ... IOW, training.  Even weight training, a physical activity rather than a mental one, is in that class.<br><br>The one example you gave which matches the kind of "task" I was thinking about is writing an essay.  It is bounded and has an end point.  I also agree that the maturation process, as you call it, works to our benefit there.  But I think that it may come down to how we define "little".  I know from experience that writing an essay (say a four hour task) is best done in a "few" sessions, not "many" sessions.  IOW, it is useful to work at writing the draft until it is completed and then let it "simmer", come back to it, then start  writing a second draft.  I have not found it useful to pickup and put down my work on the draft a dozen times.   Beside the consideration of the overhead involved in starting up so many times I get a sense of frustration and confusion.  "Oh no, back to this!  Will it ever end?"  and  "Crap, where was I here ... what was I thinking of last time?"<br><br>So I don't know if we are talking at cross purposes, comparing apples to oranges, or just have different work styles -- or techniques which work best for us.<br><br>But I am now clear about how you envision the AF process working ... small efforts on tasks helps in getting the tasks done.</div>

I use "little and often" all the time, and have found it exceptionally effective at breaking down difficult tasks.  <br><br>It's always something of a shock to come back to the beginning of the list and see those few remaining "old" tasks that I first wrote down just a few days ago.  But when I read through them, they are still pertinent, one or two of them still "stands out", and I do some little action, and copy them forward.  <br><br>But it's still slow going overall, since I have so many tasks.<br><br>I must say that this is the first system that has allowed me to manage this volume of work at all.  With every other method I've tried, including DIT, GTD, and a variety of software packages (Toodledo, Remember the Milk), the "less important" tasks never made it onto my daily radar screen *at all*.  Now, I do see them all, at least once or twice a day.<br><br>I just wish I could make it move faster somehow.  <br><br>Any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>You seem to have mastered the art of getting the unpleasant tasks out of the way - that was something I could never manage to achieve.  I always felt that somehow, if I could just get those things done, I would suddenly be free to enjoy myself.  However it never quite worked - I was always "nearly there" with just a few more things to do - "if I can just get this and that finished   ..........."  except that they never got done and I found myself in a position where I resented anything that took me away from just struggling to do "stuff". I even started to resent leisure time as it was taking me away from my goal to clear "just these last few problems" (I had gone way past just common old guilt over leisure time......)<br><br>Like Seraphim I am to a degree struggling with just the volume of stuff I have outstanding, but it really is getting done and enjoyably!  Very little of my time since starting AF has been unpleasant (there have been a few "have to do nows" which "had to be done" but that is the result of my having created a major backlog pre AF).  I would love to have more of my backlog gone but having created a mammoth (nothing so petite and mundane as an elephant!) if I try to eat too much at one time all I will end up with is indigestion!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>Mark bailed me out of a nasty backlog a few years ago.  I think the article was called "Muddy Field".  I can never forget my gratitude to him for that.  He not only explains how to chip at the backlog as a current initiative, he also explained how to sort it out first.  He also wisely stated that one must adapt to means of staying current so that won't happen again!  LOL!  I don't ever want to go through that again!  LOL!  Perhaps you could search backlog on this site.  I seem to remember that he wrote more than the one article....but that was the one that he recommended for me to start the processes of both setting up the backlog and learning how to master staying current.  He also has articles about setting up files, composing checklists, how to break resistance.....lots of rich ideas!  <br><br>If he could successfully guide me with all my impairments, you'll surely do well also.

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Christine, a secret......mundane tasks are an ongoing aspect of daily life.  Much as I don't enjoy doing them, I also realize that they aren't going to completely disappear.  Even celebs have tasks they don't like to do!  LOL!  My solution:  LIMIT the amount I'm willing to do....silt it down the lowest common denominator of your personal pride and tolerance level....no more or no less!  (I even tracked them too see how often they needed doing and how long they took.  My personal limit is 90 minutes a day unless I add more to free up a future day.  <br>I also follow Mark's advice about limiting my office hours.  I don't limit myself to certain hours if it's work I love to do....some work is more pleasurable to me than standard leisure activities.  But.....having normal work hours gives me a time frame to work in and to play in after I'm done!  I only allow these lines to be blurred if it's something I would do anyway without getting paid....I'm after the experiencing more than any money.....you know what I mean......I won't be working on my ledgers unless I had a national inclination towards that......everybody get their thrills differently!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I think one reason this system appears to be moving more "slowly" than DIT is because you have a bigger goal in mind. DIT's goal was to get yesterday's work done today. AF's goal is to work systematically through all your tasks--many tasks that never even made it to the list in DIT. I'm afraid it's easy to fall into the trap of expecting this huge backlog of tasks to disappear over night when for many of us, it's taken years to accumulate them all! <br><br>I think with AF, you have to come to trust that the tortoise will win the race. I'll be delighted when I've cleared my first few pages as it means I've completed or at least started on projects that I've wanted to do for months and years. One thing I do to motivate myself is to calculate how many tasks I complete daily on average. I then determine how many are still outstanding and use that to determine how many days it will take me to clear the outstanding tasks. It's pretty incredible really! Certainly, new tasks will be added, but I'm not adding them nearly as quickly as I was to begin with. <br><br>Another approach that may help you to view your progress as being acceptable is to remember that you're also (I hope!) including leisure tasks. These tasks are meant to restore you and add to the quality of your life. They certainly shouldn't be rushed! <br><br>That reminds me, Mark, that one thing I like about AF as compared to DIT is I don't have to choose one project to work on to completion. The decision about what that "one" should be made me crazy! I always have so many balls in the air and truth be told, I LIKE it that way. I find life a lot more exciting than if I only have one thing to do.</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>Many thanks for that - I found the article which is great (but I would expect no less!)  I have always found Mark's tips tricks & techniques to be immensely valuable and they have formed a core of my own personal Time Management for many years.  I have used varying systems over the years, produced by various people, self included.  Many of the systems I used had a significant impact on my backlogs BUT they never felt effortless.  there was always that element that "I must do this".  Discipline is important, nay essential in life, but that does not always mean that it is easy.  For me AF answers that elusive quest for the effortless way to manage my time/life etc.  <br><br>Mel<br><br>You are absolutely right - I am finding my lists are growing very quickly BUT that is not a problem.  I know it is partly a result of my previous backlog (which has to have an impact, as, for most of us, those backlogs still need to be addressed) but also as a result of feeling more creative, having more ideas, and knowing where to put them.  The fact that I use my list for anything is so freeing - if it needs to go somewhere else later it will do so automatically.<br><br>I can really echo your point about working on more than one project at a time.  The logic of the current initiative is inescapable but if I had a major project (normally of the "home grown, organic, backlog" variety) I could not just work on it to the exclusion of other projects. AF answers all of those concerns.<br><br>Interestingly this week I have noticed a reluctance to actually put some items on the list.  It was very natural for me then to question why and so identify the reason for that resistance even before the item got into the system (which I have of course disciplined myself to do :-) - can't say that part is effortless yet!)</div>

I've always been in close relationship with my intuition.  <br>I was thinking of continuing my habits, my normal checklists, and to try a totally discretionary autofocus list......Because I tend toward action, maybe I'll add to the list only at day's end or day's beginning......I haven't found a way to circumvent my short term memory loss issues  (remembering and deciding.....memory is VERY critical to deciding) and pain......broken focus, forced will.....all against autofocus rules.......<br>I wish I could experience what you all do with this.....*sigh*  I'll find a way...even if it's quite modified.....These posts you all write have me inspired to keep trying....because I don't find pleasure in work I hate.  To be frank, I'm aghast when you all say it's pleasant to do menial, boring and distasteful tasks because of the structure of autofocus.....But then again, when I'm in enough pain, I have to soft-soap myself plenty to even bother with anything....and yet I do.....because when the pain and/or meds abate......I want to feel at least current so that I can joyously and gratefully re-engage in the life matters that I'm most grateful for......pain makes almost everything more wonderful when it abates....I suppose there's good to almost everything in life if one can find the advantageous perspective to view it from!  LOL!  (Sorry to be maudlin....last few days have been hard...better days to come round....soon, I hope!  LOL!  Now to bundle up and allow dog to relieve herself in sub zero weather......don't think about past skiing.trips ...don't begrudge the cane.....DO enjoy the gradeur of the scenery and DO focus on how the dog loves the experience.....(my ongoing soft-soaping myself  to keep on...*blush*)<br>learning as I go<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi, Mel<br>Me, too!  I like having options that allow me to massage a great feeling and also to preserve my sense of pride.  If I only had one choice and I wasn't capable at the moment, I'd be literally stuck!  LOL!  I feel much better when I can be proactive and choose projects that match my abilities at the time....The only things I use a stick for and not a carrot are NECESSARY items.  I'm eligable for free care, but I made a decision that I prefer independence........That provides a GREAT IMPETUS TO ACTION.  If my home is clean, my dog and myself properly cared for, and my finances current.......then nobody can claim to be in charge of my affairs........LOL!  LOL!  LOL!  Preserving my pride is part of it....but preserving my personal freedom always keeps me jumping ahead of the stick!  LOL!  (Loving people can and DO get waysided by temptations.....I'll do whatever it takes to not give the courts a reason to give over my personal authority and freedoms to ANYBODY other than myself.......You'll keep things in order when so much is riding on it!  LOL! .......meds are really kicking in now!<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">@Mark:  You wrote "If you are dealing with everything that needs to be dealt with, does it matter how slowly the system is going?"<br><br>Moving slowly increases my anxiety level.  I don't have a good feel for what's on my list.  I feel pressure to jump forward, in case there's something "more important" on the next page, rather than focus on the items that stand out.  <br><br>If I could move through the list more quickly, I'd have a better general idea of what's on it, and not worry so much that I'm missing something urgent.<br><br>For example, those "same day" items...   If I don't hit them fast enough, then they slip to the next day.  And if that next day is full of meetings, it means they slip to the *next* day.  But, I can't remember what they all are, so I can't just say "Oh this one's urgent, let's make it an exception and do it now".  <br><br>If there really is a hard deadline, I've been putting it into Autofocus, but also blocking out some time for the task on my calendar.  That does help.  But it's more fun when Autofocus handles it.  :-)<br><br>Generally, I *am* finding that trusting the system does work...  But I am tempted pretty often to follow my anxiety instead.</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>Your posts are a real inspiration - whilst I have been through a period where various things that occurred, including health issues, got my stress levels to a stage where I could not concentrate on anything, including things I enjoyed such as reading or watching a movie for even 15 minutes that was ultimately short term (thankfully!) I can't even begin to imagine how hard it must be to know that there will always be days when you can't do what you want, regardless of outside influences.<br>  <br>All I can say though - is LOVE your duplicates - don't kick them out, just take into account that each time you find one you have another item to cross off your list!!!  That is a GOOD thing :-)<br><br>You are obviously doing great and I really admire your ability to focus</div>

<div class="content">I just read through my entire list quickly as I ended my work day, to make sure I hadn't lost track of anything essential for the day. Earlier in the week I forgot to do a couple of things because I hadn't made it all the way through the list one last time.</div>

<div class="content">Sort and scan by eye, I'd say ... duplicates will follow each other.  (In fact, if you were to write a program to remove duplicates (and I have written my share of them over the years), that is how you would do it: write a sort algorithm and compare each item to the previous one as you go.)<br><br>But with regard to AF, what does it matter.  If I think of something to add and it is actually already on the list ... what is the harm?  I'll do one and then when I hit the second one I'll realize it is already done and just cross it off.  Paper or electronic, it takes care of its self.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>You're probably correct.  I might be interpreting my seeing so many duplicates as proof positive that my brain injuries make me a "less than"  *blush*  Maybe I should find a way to have a more merciful response........It takes lots of focus to try to hide my disabilities from others.....even more to attempt to hide them from myself!  *blush*<br>Thank you.....I don't know where it will take me, but I'll try to gain from your perspective.<br>learning as I go<br>p.s. I've already learned much from your various posts.  You seem to have a knack for finding the more advantageous perspective to think and act from.</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>Thanks for the kind words.  I don't have a brain "injury" (that I know of) but I do have  some mental processing ... ummm ... well, let's just say that I do things in my own way ;-)<br><br>For me, it is all about accepting who you are and learning the best way to accomplish what you want.  I don't know what it would be like to have a different way of functioning, but I can tell you that every time someone suggests that they have drugs for what ails me, I thank the gods that I was not born in the last 20 years or so when those would have been forced on me.  I am not interested in having my mind altered ;-)  I am fine with using what I have any way I can.<br><br>In fact, I can't imagine what it would be like to be "different", even if that seems as though it might be "better".  As Popeye said: "I yam what I yam."  ;-)<br><br>As to how to use AF, just follow along and don't try to perfect the system make helpful changes but don't go for perfection... the cost is SO VERY LOW, to rewrite things that it makes sense to just go with it.  If you have "Take out the trash" on your list a dozen times because it keeps occurring to you and you are not yet ready and you forgot you thought of it before ... what's the harm?  You'll just have a dozen reminders each time through the list and the list will nag you to do it ;-)<br><br>As to brain injury ... it is an expanding field, but it seems as if the brain will often "rewire" itself to bypass areas that don't function.  Other areas of the brain will take up the task.  One interesting aspect of this is the observation that blind people have other senses that are sharper.  Actually, what seems to be happening (as shown by studies of cat scans) is that the part of the brain devoted to processing visual images is very large and when one is blind, there is all of this unused brain which goes off looking for work ... and it will often find it by helping to process hearing and other sense.<br><br>It was once thought that the brain had all of these areas of specialized processing.  While partly true, it seems as though processing is very distributed as well ... and things are continually changing.  So the advice seems now to be that if you are limited in some way, look for a "work around" and that will cause your brain to rewire itself in helpful ways.<br><br>Just some thoughts and FWIW ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>Your knowledge is totally correct.  I had well over a YEAR of cognitive reconstruction therapy and I continue to do my exercises!  The results were nothing short of miraculous.  I used to have to follow embarrassingly basic cheat sheet to eat, hygiene, etc and log in the time.  If I forgot to log in the time, I'd do things like going to shower and see that the tiles were wet .....same thing with the toothbrush.....I still have to write my clothes, meals, etc...........Thank You.......I'm so busy covering up.....I forgot how much I've improved.......THANK YOU!   Yes, I have much to be grateful for....and even though my doctor said my window for cognitive abilities has mostly expired, I still do the exercises faithfully.  I was worst hit with oral comprehension and memory...( I couldn't even follow a conversation at ALL or follow a TV show)  A few of my friends have told me that my memory and conversational skills have improved much......Of course, I still get  thrown at me with consternation...."I already told you"  I used to CRUMBLE when I heard that......Now I simply state to friends/loved ones...."You know I'm trying my best" and laugh................To others......"sorry" and that's the end of it!  LOL!<br><br>Again..........THANK YOU for the great perspective.....I sometimes forget how far I've come!!!!!  Of course, I'll always be grateful to my surgeon and my other doctors!  I owe much gratitude.....<br>learning as I go</div>
