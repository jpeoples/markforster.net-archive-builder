<div class="content">Just so you don't move from HERE!  ;-)<br><br>But I marvel just a bit ... did you really go through all that analysis to arrive at the conclusion that you might increase your level of stress (to say nothing of your longevity) if you moved to a safer part of town?  I'm living in Gaithersburg, MD, a fairly typical suburb of D.C.  It is not dangerous by any stretch, but I'm semi consciously been noting the increasing police reports of theft and other such "smaller" crimes.  I've already decided to move ... it is only a question of where and when.  I did not find it necessary to perform a statistical analysis ;-)<br><br>Stay situationaly aware and save, Norman.</div>

<div class="content">"Preview post", Mike! <rolls eyes><br><br>Yes please remain and safe Norman.<br><br>Slightly off topic, in Detroit they found a solution of sorts: Expropriate the worst neighbourhoods and make everybody move away.  Then they tear down the mess and build expensive housing.  <br><br>The theory is that by separating the people from their enemies, breaking up drug channels, moving people to more hopeful locations, everybody improves their lot.  I'm not sure if it's long-term effective (and not sure if mayor/criminal Kwame Kilpatrick personally profited from these transactions) but I can tell you those particular neighbourhoods became much safer.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe I will take up my example of using AF to discern whether or not to move in this thread as continuation of the thread where I failed at conveying how AF can inform morals, values, judgements, etc.<br><br>In any case, the concern is appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">But, speaking of which ...<br><br>My loony tunes brother kept a wall map of the area in which he lived and he'd put push pins in the location of every crime.  I mean, talk about missing the point!  (Pun intended ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I live in the most dangerous neighborhood. Used to run wild in Detroit. There parts of Detroit which are really crazy.<br><br>NYC is pretty much a Hollywood creation as a high crime area. <br><br>Baltimore, parts of Detroit, my neighborhood are places where you don't want to get involved in nonsense.<br><br>Recently in Chicago and near Hyde Park (just south I think), some serious drama happens. So you can toss Chicago in there.<br><br>Florida always has a lot of press about the violence, but it is so gang-involved it is no big deal, if you have nothing to do with the organized crime. Where there is not a strong organized presence and where you have a lot of young men constantly trying best each other, things don't go well.<br><br>Under the best of circumstances, young men engaging in machismo is never a good recipe for happy-endings. Add in guns, money, and drugs, and well without adult supervision, it can be chaotic.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>With google maps integration with the local law enforcement agencies, you basically get the same thing your brother was doing with more info. My neighborhood is just completely covered. Most pins represent dozens of crimes over the last few years.<br><br>The funny thing is that if you were to visit me, you would find my street charming and my neighborhood quite interesting and wonderful at certain times during the day. (My street is always quite wonderful.)<br><br>The city I live is a sociological anomaly in the US. It is a city made of distinctive neighborhoods and in each extreme affluence and poverty lie right next to each other. And it has remained in this strange stasis for some time.<br><br>When living in the city, people actually choose where to live based on which half of the block they are looking at. One street is "good" the other is "terrible". And those streets are adjacent. With staggering differences in property values.</div>
