<div class="content">This post is an instruction to myself.  I have this worry that things will get lost and disorganized, and so I'm studying the system and how to make sure this doesn't happen.  This is taking too long, so here's my solution:<br><br>Add to my list the following tasks:<br>1. Tweak<br>2. Scan areas I think I might be forgetting something.<br><br>Now following the little and often process, I can forget about getting it perfect, and be confident it will get work.  If it doesn't work, the Tweak task is there to fix it.  Now with any luck eventually Tweak will get ignored because I can't think of a specific problem to fix.  Tweak will migrate to the backlog and get dismissed because practically speaking there won't be any more problem.<br><br>Thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">I like the title of this post! I have used many todo management systems over the years.They are engaging and productive at first as I "move in" and place all my todos in the right buckets and process them in the right way. But soon I start spending more time on the process itself than actually getting my work done. It is much more fun to move the todos around than to actually deal with them. Soon I have lots of subtasks and categories and nicely prioritized lists...that I never act on. The beauty of AF is that your tasks have nowhere to hide. The only thing you can do with them is to get them done.</div>

<div class="content">I think in all areas of time management including tweaking there is a point of diminishing and even negative returns.  The reality is every minute spent organizing is a minute not spent doing.  Complexity is in my opinion a negative force that must be fought against.  Complexity usually takes time away from doing in time management, which is why I like simple systems with low overhead.  <br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">Yes, organizing is overhead.  <br><br>But there is still that difficult matter about whether or not you can trust your system.  If you can't rely on your system (or you DON'T KNOW whether you can rely on your system), there is always something in the back of your mind, nagging you.<br><br>In my experience, that's what drives the tweaking.  You keep finding edge cases that the system can't seem to handle.  So you create a tweak to address that edge case.<br><br>Pretty soon you lose track of the tweaks and have a monster system that requires 24-hr care and feeding.  <br><br>Another approach (which I learned from doing AF and from watching Mark), is to follow the given system for a time, until you learn to trust it.  During this initial trial phase, you can use a safety net, like using reminders OUTSIDE the system that address all your edge-case worries.   The idea of the safety net is that it is temporary and doesn't change the mechanics of the actual system.<br><br>E.g., you have a deadline coming.  A really important one.  If you miss, it will be a significant loss of revenue or whatever.  So, you put it into AF and work it as normal.  But also put a series of reminders on your calendar or Outlook or whatever -- "Deadline coming!  Everything OK?"<br><br>The reminder gives me plenty of warning, in case AF somehow didn't deliver on time.  It gives me time to recover. <br><br>But Autofocus ***DOES*** deliver...   So eventually I totally forgot about the safety net reminders and rarely even think to use them.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Actually, I think any reasonably "closed" and consistent and complete system works.  I'm quite sure if I followed GtD it would work ... it is just that the cost is too high for me ... it is not high for others, it seems.  Likewise the very simple basic prioritized ToTo lists (a la Lakein) work ... they worked for me.<br><br>I think the main reason we end up tweaking is that the systmes don't "fit" our style of working.  i.e. it all comes down to what makes us comfortable given the way we are and the way we work.</div>
