<div class="content">One and a half hours to subscribe to a journal? Hmm....</div>

<div class="content">Mark - the entire ritual (according to the author) should take 5 minutes.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>The ritual may take 5 minutes but it leads him to allocate 1.5 hours to the task.<br><br>I would think that allocating a single 1.5 hours block to a task like researching, selecting and subscribing to a journal (assuming it really needs that long) is not the best use of the time, because:<br><br>1) To have a block that long with that type of task would encourage too much rambling around. It's a discursive type of task rather than a sequence of actions and a series of shorter bursts would suit it better.<br><br>2) Doing it in one block does not allow for any maturation, i.e. subconscious processing of the information received.<br><br>For a better way of doing it see my forthcoming book. It doesn't involve any rituals.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><<It doesn't involve any rituals.>><br><br>Why is that a good thing?<br><br>I was quite moved by Steven Pressfield & Twyla Tharp's description of their daily rituals. To each his own I guess.<br><br>I'll still devour your book though ;)</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< Why is that a good thing? >><br><br>I didn't say that not having any rituals was a good thing. What I said was that the method in my book was better than the method described by Cal Newport and didn't involve any rituals, which is not quite the same thing. You could use my method with a ritual if you wanted to and it would still be better! <br><br>Personally I find the concentration comes out of good work practices, rather than out of a ritual - but if you find having one helps then by all means use it.</div>

<div class="content">He's not subscribing to a journal, he's deciding which one to submit a paper to.<br><br>There's a lot involved in submitting a paper, and if you pick wrong, your paper doesn't get published, or doesn't get seen by as many people as possible, who are doing similar research -- which is very important as a PhD student.<br><br>The ritual takes 5 minutes, and sets him up for a productive 90 minutes.<br><br>I agree with Mark about needing to let the decision mature. I'd split it into one day actually make a list, set a schedule (so this phase doesn't take the entire term), and order an issue or three of each. After that, depending on how many there are, either spend a few days weeding out the obviously wrong choices, or knuckle down and read a few issues a day.<br><br>For some, the ritual might be finish lunch, wash up, go upstairs. I often find writing a list of what I want to accomplish during the session helps me settle in.</div>
