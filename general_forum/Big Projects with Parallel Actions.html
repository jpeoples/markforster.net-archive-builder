<div class="content">How would you suggest handling projects that are big enough to have multiple actions that can be executed in parallel? Or that have enough sub-actions that you might forget some of them?<br><br>On my list (I'm thinking FVP or AF1), is it better to add a single entry for the whole project, picking one piece to work on at a time, or is it better to enter everything separately? Or does it make sense to keep a single entry in my main list, while maintaining a separate list just for that project?<br><br>What has worked for you?</div>

<div class="content">I'll just have a key task "Project X, more planning needed?" and action that task via the normal AF routine.<br><br>Additionally I just would write down any task (pertaining to project X) I can think of on the AF list and work from there.<br><br><br>You may find project X to be even more complex than that, in which case I would produce a detailed project plan with checklists and what not. I would consult this document if need be, also update regularly. But, I still would note single tasks on the AF list and work from there.<br><br>Of course I also would add key dates onto my regular calendar. But, I still would put anything I had to work on on the AF list and work from there.</div>

<div class="content">I think Mark has counseled in the past (and written in his book) and you can do either.  Try them both out, and see what you prefer.  <br><br>I tend to put all sub tasks on my lists, but just because I've never tried the other way.</div>

<div class="content">Handling "next actions" for concurrent multiple projects -  there doesn't seem to be an easy, foolproof, perfect way of dealing with these.  David Allen estimates that one might have 30-100 open current projects (if my memory is correct), and suggests in the weekly review that you make sure that all of them have a next action.  He also suggests organizing the next actions by context, and dealing with them in that way.  All of this requires a lot of organization.  If the project is moving forward quickly, the next actions keep on changing and getting updated.  <br>Some software programs do not allow for subtasks below a task.  Some allow for projects, and subtasks, but these can get so complicated, they are difficult to use.  Most projects don't need this much organization.  <br>The advice that has been given in the previous posts is good. <br>If the project only requires a few steps, it might be easier just to write the few steps down on the AF list.  If a project has many steps, one could have a sublist for the project, and put the project name on the AF list. <br>One could limit the number of projects, and keep an eye everyday on these.  <br>If one has finished a next action, one could ask "what's the next action?" and then write that on the list. <br>I have been hoping that others will comment on this thread, as I could use more improvement on handling this. <br><br>There is a book: <br>https://www.google.com/books/edition/To_Do_Doing_Done/JHBz3JZoYuEC?hl=en&gbpv=0<br><br>that has some good cross-referencing suggestions using a dayplanner, between the project plan, calendar, and daily to-do list, and files.  Perhaps on projects that don't move fast, and are long-term this might be good.  But on fast-moving projects, it requires so much updating.  <br><br>Perhaps on these next actions, it is going to be somewhat messy. (?)</div>

<div class="content">In my little spiral composition notebook where I keep my day-job tasks, I occasionally dedicate a back page to a specific project and brain dump tasks there, if they're on my mind. It helps to calm my overheated mind down in the moment. When I see the project name pop up in the AF list, then I can check that page and remind myself of tasks to add. <br><br>But it's messy, yes. I don't always do this, only when the spirit moves me.</div>

<div class="content">I moved to an electronic list that allows tagging. If it is part of a project, it gets tagged with that project name. . I work the list and when I get to an item with a tag, I can click on the tag, see all the tasks related to that project and do more than one if the spirit moves me. <br><br>I vacillate between Workflowy, Dynalist and Microsoft To-do, they all have this tagging feature. Other apps do too, I am sure.</div>

<div class="content">Cameron:<br><br><< I think Mark has counseled in the past (and written in his book) and you can do either. >><br><br>I think what I have actually counseled in the past is that you can do both. In other words one method may suit one type of project and the other suit another type of project. Or you can use both for different bits of the same project.<br><br>Also see what I have written about Dynamic Lists:<br><br><a href="../blog/Types of Lists VIII - The Dynamic List.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/1/types-of-lists-viii-the-dynamic-list.html</a><br><br><a href="../blog/Dynamic Lists.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/13/dynamic-lists.html</a><br><br><a href="../blog/Dynamic Lists v.
