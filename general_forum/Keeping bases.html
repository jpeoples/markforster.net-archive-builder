<div class="content">How is Mark doing?<br><br>I know I don't regularly look at all the threads here but I can't help but notice that Mark didn't reply for a while now.<br><br>I was wondering if things went well and if you are still working at your latest system.</div>

<div class="content">Mark largely lurks these days.  I've seen him comment recently ... so he IS out there ;-)  You might recall that he has threatened to retire several times in the past and so perhaps he now has actually done it.  Time will tell ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I don't blame him :)<br>So, since this thread is about touching bases, how have YOU been doing Mike?</div>

<div class="content">He deserves a break! He has given us so many useful resources that have truly changed my life! Thank you Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Maybe Mark is having a break from us(!), and time management, and just does what he feels like doing when he wants to ;-)<br><br>I too am grateful for what Mark has done, though what I use is like a bidirectional to do list, with elements of AF and DIT.<br><br>Maybe I'm a bit like one of these indiginous people that only half listens to what the missionaries say, then weave some of it into their way of thinking.</div>

<div class="content">I think that it is quite healthy to look at any kind of system even if you don't use it per say. It helps you identify what works for you and why :)</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>I'm doing well, thanks for asking.  I'm not so much messing with time management systems these days.  My year+ fooling with the various versions of AF taught me that I needed to get back to the fundamentals.  I have a prioritized To Do list with certain tasks scheduled (time boxed).  I have gotten back to the reality that no time management system will make a nasty task appealing.  Some things just have to be tackled head on no matter how much I don't want to do them.  In the end, if I took all the time I have spent trying to make tasks palatable and put it into just DOING them, I'd be much farther ahead of the game.<br><br>I think that the quest for the perfect time management system, the coolest notebook, the slickest pen ... all of that ... is as pointless as the quest for El Dorado.  Empires were planned on the back of envelopes, after all.  Too much focus on the means and not enough on the end.</div>

<div class="content">Mike - very nice. However I believe this:<br><a href="http://www.epicwinapp.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.epicwinapp.com/</a><br>will tap into my inner geeky 14 year old, motivating me to do tasks I'd prefer to avoid. <br><br>I'm still using ZTD (1 Goal, 1 Habit, 3 Projects, 3 MITs) with success.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum ... nice ;-)  I'm happy you have found something that is working for you.  Are you still doing the OPA method, or did that not prove helpful in the long run?</div>

<div class="content">@Mike<br><br>I like nice tools myself, they put me in the "mood" to take on stuff but I, like you, think that the concepts are far more important then the looks ;)</div>

<div class="content">@Avrum<br><br>"I'm still using ZTD (1 Goal, 1 Habit, 3 Projects, 3 MITs) with success."<br><br>Could you fill this out just a little? Is this a daily/weekly/general way of keeping on track? What are MTDs? etc.?<br>A short explanation would be great for those like me who don't have the time to research or can't recall if this has been covered before here.<br><br>Thanks in advance.</div>

<div class="content">Robina,<br><br>ZTD is "Zen To Done", Leo Babauta's version of GTD (David Allen's "Getting Things Done").<br>MITs are Most Important Tasks.<br><br>The minimalist version of ZTD goes like this:<br><br>The Four Habits :<br><br>1) collect. Habit: ubiquitous capture. Carry a small notebook (or whatever capture tool works for you) and write down any tasks, ideas, projects, or other information that pop into your head. Get it out of your head and onto paper, so you don’t forget it. This is the same as GTD. But ZTD asks you to pick a very simple, portable, easy-to-use tool for capture — a small notebook or small stack of index cards are preferred (but not mandated), simply because they are much easier to use and carry around than a PDA or notebook computer. The simpler the tools, the better. When you get back to your home or office, empty your notes into your to-do list. <br><br>2) process. Habit: make quick decisions on things in your inbox, do not put them off. Letting stuff pile up is procrastinating on making decisions. Process your inboxes (email, physical, voicemail, notebook) at least once a day, and more frequently if needed. When you process, do it from the top down, making a decision on each item, as in GTD: do it (if it takes 2 minutes or less), trash it, delegate it, file it, or put it on your to-do list or calendar to do later. <br><br>3) plan. Habit: set MITs for week, day. Each week, list the Big Rocks that you want to accomplish, and schedule them first. Each day, create a list of 1-3 MITs (basically your Big Rocks for the day) and be sure to accomplish them. Do your MITs early in the day to get them out of the way and to ensure that they get done.<br><br>4) do (focus). Habit: do one task at a time, without distractions. This is one of the most important habits in ZTD. You must select a task (preferably one of your MITs) and focus on it to the exclusion of all else. First, eliminate all distractions. Shut off email, cell phone, Internet if possible (otherwise just close all unnecessary tabs), clutter on your desk (if you follow habit 2, this should be pretty easy). Then, set a timer if you like, or otherwise just focus on your task for as long as possible. Don’t let yourself get distracted from it. If you get interrupted, write down any request or incoming tasks/info on your notepad, and get back to your task. Don’t try to multi-task. <br><br>The minimalist implementation:<br><br>First the tools: A small notebook and a pen. That’s all.<br><br>1. Use your notebook to write everything down as you think of it. This allows you to get things off your mind and not forget them. <br>2. When you get to your desk or home, add those new tasks to your Master To-do List, which you can also keep in your notebook. <br>3. At the beginning of each day, review your list, and write down 1-3 MITs that you’d like to accomplish for the day. That’s your whole planning system. You don’t need any more than that. <br>4. Get your MITs done as early as possible. When you do each task, clear away all distractions and focus on doing that one task only. Do not multi-task. When you’re done, move on to the next MIT. <br>5. If you complete your MITs, go to your Master List and see what’s the next most important task on the list. Do it as in Step 4 above. Repeat as needed. <br><br>More info at <br><a href="http://zenhabits.net/minimal-ztd-the-simplest-system-possible/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/minimal-ztd-the-simplest-system-possible/</a><br>and<br><a href="http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/</a><br><br>My personal experience with ZTD has been that it works quite well in combination with an Autofocus list, esp. AF4. <br>ZTD as described above and AF4 for all the "loose ends" at work and at home, AF4 List = Master List.</div>

<div class="content">@mike indeed agree witv you  ! I have spent too much time looking for the graal of time management. Now my credo is just will i ? And if yes how ?<br>@rainer what a great summary of ztd thanks<br>I bought leo's ebook it is very helpfull. For me it w<br>Was just the light version of gtd i still use it.<br>About my personal experience i still use gtd basic principle for thinking and control  and af4 for doing actionable tasks. It just works. But i think leo is right for short time acts such as daily/weekly tasks.<br>All methods has suitable things for some.<br>Little by little exchanging tips we find what is suitable for us. This is why mf forum is interesting because of different experiences which make us better little by little.</div>

<div class="content">@ Rainer<br>I agree with Jupiter. Great summary - and summary of summary! Thanks for your clear, simple, comprehensive and prompt response. <br><br>It's useful to see how you combine it with AF4 and gives me the idea I can use it with my DWM month process in a similar fashion - as I've already been edging that way anyway....<br><br>Cheers!</div>
