<div class="content">Hi All,<br><br>I work from home so do everything from one location. I wanted one list but also wanted a way to keep my work items a bit separate. I have an idea which I believe is an improvement over the Mark's suggestion of splitting the page in advance e.g. 2/3 Work, 1/3 personal.<br><br>It's very simple. For me I list my personal items from the top of the page (which were the majority over the weekend when I had the idea), but for my work items I start at the bottom of the page and work my way up. When and wherever the two meet, I draw a line in between.<br><br>I think having the line be dynamically adjustable depending on work-load and day of the week is very useful.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>Jon</div>

<div class="content">So why not just add items to the list as they occur, paying no attention to personal v. work?  I mean, I have one life, after all.  If you fix the number of work and personal, you are at least balancing.  If you just add the personal ones from the bottom-up, it is more a case of grouping than balancing.<br><br>I guess I'm saying that any process of selection is more in the top-down planning area than the bottom-up execution area, no?  On my planning day, I look at my goals and decide which ones I will do something on this next week.  For those I wish to advance, I pick some activities and add them to my list.  The order in which I add them to the list seems irrelevant to me.  They are just added in whatever order they come as I review my goals.  The AF process manages them after that -- they are bound to get shuffled around.</div>

<div class="content">I will try, I think it is a very good idea!</div>

<div class="content">Really glad most of you seem to like the idea! :)<br><br>Mike,<br><br>There's a couple of reasons why it's helpful for me to group the tasks:<br><br>Although I work from home, I am employed, so have certain times when I'm supposed to be working (although I will do the odd personal in between work sessions).<br>Also, when my boss calls me and wants to know what's on my To-Do list, it's much easier to look at the bottom of all my pages, rather than go through every entry on every page.<br><br>Most of my tasks are in fact personal items. But a lot of the personal items are routines which can be done very quickly. I have a lot less tasks listed for work items, but these are usually more time-consuming tasks.<br><br>So you see, to set the size of the split in advance does not give me any balance, because balancing the number of tasks in work/personal is not the same as balancing my time in work/personal.<br><br>Jon</div>

<div class="content">What awful spelling in the thread title by the way! :P I obviously meant 'Dynamically' ! It must be time to cross off that 'take a nap' item..</div>

<div class="content">I remember reading about the Top-down/Bottom-up approach in Bill Westerman's Getting Sh*t Done system (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davegray/145761460/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/davegray/145761460/</a> or <a href="http://www.utilware.com/gsd3.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.utilware.com/gsd3.html).</a>  The Flickr page has notes that indicate the same method.  A good idea for either system! <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jon,<br><br>I see your point.  I had not thought of that situation.  It is rather like having to produce a report and setting up the system to produce that report.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for reminding me of such a simple solution to the problem. In fact, I did this on my daily planner pages for DIT -- work from top down, personal from bottom up. Why I didn't think of doing this for AF is beyond me.<br><br>I'm trying out this solution now. I prefer a single-notebook solution, if possible. And spring classes started today, so I've got a whole raft of tasks to throw at AF! Will be interesting to see how/if it helps me manage my school and home responsibilities (which have to be separate from my office-work responsibilities).<br><br>meb</div>
