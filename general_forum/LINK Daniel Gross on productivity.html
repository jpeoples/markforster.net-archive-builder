<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Gross appears to be an investor of some kind; I don't know him or his background. But this post swam up from the depths: <br><br>Improvising for Productivity | Daniel Gross<br><a href="http://dcgross.com/improvising-for-productivity/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dcgross.com/improvising-for-productivity/</a><br><br><br>It's a fairly short post; he suggests skipping midway to the subhead "To Dos". As I read it, I was mentally comparing his theory and method to Mark's theories and methods. I can understand his reasoning, but I'm not sure if it mirrors my thought processes or not.<br><br>His last line is "...I try to make my actual work appear as interesting as a new idea by minimizing the cognitive state buildup I have until I am ready to fully accomplish the task at hand." That is, don't engage with a task until he's ready to fully devote his full thinking and awareness to it.<br><br>He does not mention the subconscious or how tasks are brewing/composting in the bandwidth of our subconscious; his focus seems to be that tasks only exist or are being worked on when he is *consciously* engaged with them. That strikes me as a major difference to Mark's theories, if I'm reading this right.</div>

<div class="content">Read this article just as I was trying out using a schedule, calendar, rather than lists. That’s the trouble with a “plan”, lack of inspiration. Thanks for link Mike.</div>
