<div class="content">Mark closed the last thread (good move I think, it was too big.)<br><br>About getting children to do what you want, I'm a complete ignoramus.  But I thought this was interesting:  In response to the question "What do you want to do when you grow up", a child (who seems to like arts and music) said "Whatever they want me to do", and the question to the group was, how do you encourage this child to pursue his interests when he doesn't want to work at it.<br><br>Here's my ignorant thinking: You can decide the child's response (I'll do what I'm told) is good, and say "Okay I want you to practice music".  Or you could decide it's bad and get the child to grow into expressing and pursuing his/her own interests.<br><br>Personally I think a combination of both is best.  Listening to instruction, and taking initiative are both valuable skills.  How you do that, I don't know.  I think Covey's approach of delegating responsibility [get your child to accept responsibility for the quality of his/her work] has merit.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, good summation of the last thread. :-) That was me with the son who has that I'd-rather-you-told-me-what-to-do personality. Even within homeschooling circles, there is much confusion about how directive to be with a child. On the one hand you see the virtuosos and you just know that it isn't just the kid's self-discipline that got him there. On the other hand you see kids doing only what they're interested in doing at any given time. As in most things, I agree with you, Alan, that balance is best. What I try to do with my kids is ask them what they are interested in doing and then I try to keep them accountable to working on that for a specified time period. For example, if they're committed to a sport or lesson and then decide they don't like it, they have to finish out the season. Works for me.<br><br>Mike, great idea about the Spanish radio/TV. I haven't been doing that and I need to. I also like your notion that we needn't be slaves to holidays when it comes to gift giving. I had a friend who was extremely peeved about Valentine's Day for that very reason. He was hilarious and discussed the "pressure" that the whole thing put on him every year. lol So instead of feeling like I'm getting gypped of gifts on holidays I'll think about the fact that I celebrate lots of times during the year. Thanks!<br><br>Yes, we have a Wii. I thought I would use it more. I think I've only played a few times! That might have something to do with the fact that I get creamed when I play and I don't have a burning desire to get better at it. lol That's why I thought the fitness game might be good for me. I have a guy friend who is obsessed with Wii and will play until 2 or 3 in the morning. It was a riot watching my 13yo shake his head listening to the guy. My son said, "In some ways I can relate, but in other ways, that's just weird." LOL!<br><br>To bring it back to productivity/goals stuff (to the relief of the purists here), I recently found myself revisiting a goal I had a year ago. I think one reason I haven't been excited about goals is because I'm still working on a big one--finishing my novel. I have 7000 words to write in 2 days, so must fly. Hope everyone is having a great Sunday!</div>

<div class="content">Hey Mel,<br><br>>>>  What I try to do with my kids is ask them what they are interested in doing and then I try to keep them accountable to working on that for a specified time period. For example, if they're committed to a sport or lesson and then decide they don't like it, they have to finish out the season. Works for me.  <<<<br><br>Makes good sense.  It teaches responsibility and follow-through.  If they get stuck with something, they will think more carefully about future commitments.<br><br>>>>  Mike, great idea about the Spanish radio/TV. I haven't been doing that and I need to. <<<<br><br>It will be fun learning the idioms.  When I was in Panama (on a contract) for about a year, I got a giggle when someone told me she had a headache and had to drink her pills.  Thinking about it, that really is what you do, no?  I also learned that the idiom for "etc." is: ... [a burger] ...  "with fries, mustard, ketchup and all the rest of the stuff."  (Loosely translated, of course ;-)  Language is so much fun.  It gives you a different take on the world.  Enjoy your radio.  Trouble is that there are lots of kinds of Spanish ... each country has its own way of saying things.  Panamanian is very fast and clipped ... Cuban even faster.<br><br>>>>  I also like your notion that we needn't be slaves to holidays when it comes to gift giving.

Thanks!  <<<<br><br>You are quite welcome.  It is a better way to see things in any case.<br><br>>>>  Yes, we have a Wii. I thought I would use it more. I think I've only played a few times! That might have something to do with the fact that I get creamed when I play and I don't have a burning desire to get better at it. lol <<<<br><br>Some of those games can be a workout.  My wife really worked up a sweat playing tennis.  The better you get, the more difficult the game becomes.<br><br>>>>  That's why I thought the fitness game might be good for me.

<div class="content">I have less than 2900 words to write in a day so I'm feeling confident that I'll make it. <br><br>I wonder if Wii tennis would interfere with my real tennis skill development? Right now my ankles are so wiped out, I may need to make Wii tennis my sport. :-) I also need to pick up some REAL tennis shoes. Maybe my ankles will thank me. <br><br>Unfortunately, the holiday weekend is over! Back to productivity city, right?</div>

<div class="content">Well I object to closing the thread since Mike got the last word!  And more than one post with the last word too. :-)<br><br>Mel, I don't know about this:<br><br>"if they're committed to a sport or lesson and then decide they don't like it, they have to finish out the season." <br><br>Although that's always been my philosophy as well for both my kids (and myself), I'm starting to question if this is a good thing.  (It's also kind of back to the process vs. outcome thinking - do you value that kid loving the process or getting the certificate/putting in the time?)<br><br>Following this for work has at times kept me in a job when I could see in the first 2 weeks that it wasn't the right environment.  But I would tell myself to finish out the year, then better make it two because you don't want to look like you're hopping around on your resume.  Although it has been a pattern that 18 months has been as much as I could stand before giving myself permission to quit.  That's 17 1/2 months of my life I will never get back.  <br><br>But more than that, by continuing to force yourself into a situation where you are not naturally good at the sport or the job and don't like it means that you will not perform well (yet you try to force yourself), which is like dying a little inside.  Then your self confidence goes, and so on...  <br><br>Oh, I've made the same mistake in relationships too, not questioning my gut that something wasn't right and it was ok to be a quitter.<br><br>With just the sports / arts thing:  After having an extremely independent little guy, I realized that more progress was made and less frustration for everyone involved if we focused on individual instruction where possible for non-team activities.  Classes in general are taught at the median level so if someone is exceptionally talented or not at all, they lose out.  Particularly if they are exceptionally good as the less talented ones usually get more help.  I've had a session of skiing lessons regress him 2 years in ability and create fears that were not there to begin with.  What a waste.<br><br>Also making them stick with soccer (which pretend they doesn't like - and both of mine didn't) means that they don't have the time/opportunity to participate in baseball or karate or whatever.  And kids will rebel and show their displeasure in having to do something they don't want in the most maddening of ways.  For both my kids, they would drag their heels, not put any energy into it and basically make it obvious that they would not participate no way, no how.  There in body (barely), but not in mind.  (They get this from me.) LOL<br><br>I did the same thing with piano lessons as a child.  Both sisters took years of lessons and one had a minor in music in University.  I made my mother let me quit after 4 or 5 years of lessons. Years later, when we all moved away from home and would come home on the weekends, I would be the only one that would play.</div>

<div class="content">I know what you're saying. Most seasons are short though and we've given the kids the chance to try it out when possible. We just let the oldest try boy scouts and he said no after the first meeting. That's fine. <br><br>As I've blogged about, I asked to quit lessons and finally enjoyed playing. I also took lessons for a year as an adult and loved it. For everything there is a season, right?</div>

<div class="content">I did it! 50,000 words in 30 days. The novel isn't done, but I'm at least 2/3 of the way there. On to the next goal of getting ready for Christmas.<br><br>Mike, I forgot to answer you about the game systems. We have a PS2, no PS3 or XBox in addition to the Wii. The PS3 is so multi-functional that I almost bought one to use as a computer/Blu-Ray player for my HDTV. Because I am not wanting to emphasize video games as much in our house, I ended up buying a Blu-Ray equipped laptop instead. So glad I did. I love it. We can do research for school as a family and everyone can see it on the big screen. If I had to choose one game system it would be a Wii. I just bought one for my mom today. She will love it.</div>
