<div class="content">Jason (in the now locked Count Me Out thread) asked for clarification of rephrasing tasks so here is my offering in the hope that it may help .......<br><br>In going through the lists I have found, as Mark describes, that certain items jump out as somehow ready to be done and I can then do those tasks without resistance (or procrastination).  However other tasks still leave a feeling of resistance but are such that I cannot allow the system to reject them, maybe things I have to do for someone else, backlogs that have been hanging around that need clearing, or just necessary evils such as tax returns.<br><br>In examining those tasks they seemed to fall into definite categories<br><br>1) Items that be changed by rephrasing.  This works for items that somehow carry a resistance by assocation, i.e. where the wording of the task itself somehow links to a memory of feeling of resistance.  As AF works intuitively it may not always be obvious to spot because we tend to work in the way we are used to and so can perpetuate that feeling without meaning to.  It's a bit difficult to explain but a specific for me was a task simply stated as "clear list 1".  List 1 related to one of my backlog lists generated under DIT and I knew contained things I did not want to deal with.  As soon as I read "clear List 1" I had a feeling of resistance because it represented (a) backlog and (b) a sense of fear/uncertainty because I did not know exactly what was buried in it.  By rephrasing the item to "review List 1" (a very minor change!) the fear element evaporated.  That review then enabled me to list the contents of my nebulous List 1 as individual tasks, removing the uncertainty (because it defined what was in List 1) and I am totally confident that each of those "new" tasks will be actioned or perhaps ultimately rejected if appropriate.<br><br>2) Items that are so large that the thought of them creates a feeling of overwhelm, for example projects.  Listing the task as "complete project x" or even just "project x" can create a feeling of resistance because it naturally raises the question "but how?....."  By simply rephrasing to, for example, "review project x" it gives the sub-conscious the ability to freely brainstorm (for want of a better word)  the project, and the next steps will start to flow automatically from that review, leading to more intuitive tasks.<br><br>3) Items that just have to be done.  Some may be things that we really find to be chores but need to do.  For example, household chores, administrative items (filing or scanning for example), things for other people (bosses etc) or statutory tasks like Tax Returns.  Rephrasing doesn't do much for these type of tasks and they can't be rejected without consequence.  However, what I am finding with AF is the ability to identify those types of tasks and ask whether is a way that they can effectively be rejected by perhaps delegating them, employing someone to do them, creating a new filing system, or in the case of work delegated to you you might even consider changing jobs!  Resistance to a task is an intuitive indication that something is affecting us in a negative way and AF gives the "freedom of thought" to ask why rather than just do what we have always done.<br><br>4) The final category relates to items resisted for no obvious reason. In other words my rational mind said the item was easy but I had a heavy resistance   This has only happened for me on one item so far but the intuitive nature of AF caused me to question why, rather than grit my teeth and just do it.  The answer I came up with was that the reason for the resistance was not the item itself but what it represented.  I realise that anyone reading this is probably wondering what on earth I am talking about so I guess the only way to explain is to be specific so here goes ........ The item was "pay storage fees" (for my off-site storage unit).  It is a very simple item - requires 5 minutes to access my on-line banking, select the company to pay and enter the transaction.  Not difficult!!! So why am I resisting? Asking that question identified that it is what the unit represents that is the problem - the storage unit contains mainly my parents' possessions from clearing their house earlier in the year and there is not surprisingly an emotional barrier to clearing it.  Each time I pay the fees my sub-conscious is reminding me of that fact and that is what is causing the resistance.  Interesting huh?  What AF has identified is that I need to put "review strategy for clearing storage unit" on my list (NB not "clear storage unit")  :-)<br><br>Sorry folks - another long post I'm afraid but hopefully it may help someone.  I realise a lot of that may sound a bit airy-fairy but it is precisely because AF works intuitively rather than rationally than these things come up.  A rational approach would just say "well you shouldn't resist these things - just do it"  but AF gives the freedom to ask "why am I resisting and is there a better way?"</div>

<div class="content">Christine, thank you for your post. You've helped me clarify a few things regarding resistance. It hadn't occurred to me to rephrase things; I will give that a try.<br>After two days of AF, I have completed about 50% of the tasks on my list (23 out of 47), which really makes me happy. I didn't add as many new tasks today as I put on in the first day, but I'm sure I'll keep finding things to add.</div>

<div class="content">Christine, your comment on rephrasing is spot on and something that I have also identified and used to great effect yesterday on several items. I think that the system does because of its intuitive nature also allow me to question why the procrastination around an activity or task and actually (as you did with changing the emphasis on the storage unit) understand what is actually the issue which is often not the task itself but our emotions around it of perception of it.<br><br>Have only tried with Work so far and am starting on Home today, so am interested to see what is generated when I pull this list together today.</div>

<div class="content">I find it useful to first write the topic, then the action e.g. "Project A; consider" or "Article B; review". In this way I can read through a list more easily and the subject stands out more quickly. The action can be rephrased to suit one's temperament and preference.</div>

<div class="content">Christine<br><br>Thanks for your posting here and throughout the other threads.  I don't always agree, but they've helped structure my thinking about the system.<br><br>Ah, the system.  Working well for me so far.  I started with a 3-page unprocessed GTD inbox from the past three months, very organic.  I've been adding new items organically, and crossing things off like a madman.  I'm saving the rest of my review until I've used the system for 7 days, but I'm happy.  Very happy.<br><br>I have the Quick Start instructions posted on my desk and I'm resisting reading the full instructions or "thinking" about the system until after the first week of use.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br><br>Yes, I've found the same sort of thing.<br><br>One of my favourites is "plan xyz" or "think about xyz" since either of these is extremely non threatening and so I feel no resistance to them. Then I invariably come up with some first actions after a planning or thinking session which gets me started on what had previously been a highly resisted task/project.<br><br>Another favourite is "start xyz" since that again allows for not having to finish something in one go and so also lowers resistance.<br><br>Thanks for your recent posts, they have been most enlightening.</div>

<div class="content">I'm really encouraged after just three days how well the system has been working for me.  I have never tried GTD (I could tell from my initial review that for me my own procrastination would still get in the way) but have used a number of Mark's ideas over the years as well as writing a few mini systems of my own.  I had certainly found DIT to be the best overall system but had some difficulties in that I had a fairly constant level of "stuff" coming in each day but only two days when I could work all day.  AF eliminates the frustration (and guilt) of not completing a will do list.<br><br>I think I was also fortunate to have had something of a head start in that I have tried working intuitively before and found it to work well, so for me that part of the system was a concept I could grasp and slipped into that mode relatively easily.  Mark has brilliantly managed to create a system which automatically enables that side of us to kick in to play, something no other system I have looked at has ever been able to do.  Trying to explain how to "work intuitively" is not easy to do - AF's simple instructions do just that.<br><br>Life is becoming fun again!!   :-)<br><br>And thanks everyone for your kind thanks - much appreciated :-)</div>
