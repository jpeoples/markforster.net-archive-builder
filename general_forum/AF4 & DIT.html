<div class="content">Hi all, well after a very busy month of house moving and settling in of family I am now back in the the groove. I love AF4 working much much better than the earlier versions for me as the list is cycling more quickly, no stagnating middle pages - hurrahh!!<br><br>One question, as Mark previous mentioned to me in a reply to an earlier post, he felt the one aspect I would still struggle with is that of not having the "structured" daily list that you get with DIT. He was (of course) right, and I find I have started to pull out certain key items the day before and put them into a next day list including my daily do's, and once completed I then pick up with AF4 and work in pure AF4 mode. It seems to work well for me and I wondered if anyone else is trying anything similar.<br><br>This is the only change I have made, otherwise the system works great for me just as Mark has instructed. Makes me wonder if the need for the DIT style list is actually just me needing to have a bit of "control"...</div>

<div class="content">I also carried some rules over from DIT to AF4 : Every morning, I highlight a few checkboxes (I draw a checkbox in front of each task) :<br>- In yellow for due-today tasks<br>- In blue for want-to-do-today (I limit myself to one or two, following the principle of current initiative : the projects I really want to push forward today)<br><br>Then I start the day with those highlighted tasks before switching to AF4. I find it quicker than re-writing the items in a daily list (where would I write it anyway ? I don't want to clutter the notebook with AF and Daily lists alternatively)<br><br>I feel the same need to put a few priorities up the pile before I plunge into what I feel like doing (which usually is NOT priorities...)<br><br>Can't help tweaking, can we ?<br><br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br>what I do (with MLO, but it works also with paper) is to work with a daily tasklist as mentioned in Marks' book (Do it tomorrow):<br>The list could looks like this:<br><br>     CI: Current Initiative<br>     -------------<br>     Paper<br>     eMail<br>     Autofocus<br>     --------------<br>     Backup<br>     ==========<br><br>So I work according to the list. I work on Paper from yesterday in batches (DiT), on Email from yesterday in batches (Dit) and on my Autofocus (v4) list - each when the time feels right.<br><br>If new stuff comes up which have to be done today i append it to the daily tasklist.<br>If i find an item on my AF list which i commit to do tomorrow i plan it for the next day, thus it's on my daily task list for tomorrow.<br>If a new task don't have to be done on a specific day it goes at the end of my AF list.<br><br>It's like to wed DiT w/ AF - and works very well...<br>Bye, Jens</div>

<div class="content">Those key items or priorities mentioned also match the concept of MIT's (Most Important Tasks) to be done first each day, as recommended by Leo Babauta on his Zenhabits blog and in his book "The Power of Less". I tried this combination MITs first, then AF(1) a few das ago, but it didn't stick. I'm intending to try again with AF4 one of these days...</div>

<div class="content">Marc,<br><br>don't try it, but do it ! <br>Combination of ZTD's MITs and AF4 works great for me.<br>The only thing I have to take care of (regarding this combination) is to weed out all the someday-maybe-stuff that accumulates in my AF4 list. So the weekly review is still necessary.</div>

<div class="content">Rather than make a new list, how about just marking the urgent items with a highlighter or pen.  If necessary, have a counter handy so you know how many urgent items are left.  <br><br>Then you can do AF, and if you know what's urgent you will make sure to get to them.  I do see the value of what you're doing, and myself I would be strongly inclined to sneak these tasks into the AF4 Closed list so it will iterate me over these guys.</div>

<div class="content">Using OmniFocus, I put a flag against those things that MUST GET DONE today, ie have a deadline of sorts against them, and leave the rest to instinct. You have to be careful not to override the system and flag the things you would merely LIKE to get done, otherwise it all falls apart.</div>
