<div class="content">I guess I'm directing this question at Seraphim.<br><br>I'm liking using serial No-list for work and home. I'm starting to mentally stutter though, when I'm at a committee meeting or when we meet with our financial planner and I'm given lots of tasks to accomplish: some with deadlines, some not.<br><br>Where do you park those thoughts or tasks so they get actioned? For myself, I have a piece of paper from our meeting with the planner and there are 3-4 tasks I need to do before we meet with her in 2 months' time. <br><br>In a Long List, I'd simply transcribe those tasks and toss the paper. <br><br>For Serial No-list, I'm guessing that I could still transcribe those tasks on today's page, and then the notebook remembers the task for me. All previous lists that are NOT today's No-list becomes a Long List, in effect.<br><br>You may have already worked through this in previous posts, but today it got real for me :) so now I'm more interested.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike - <br><br><< Where do you park those thoughts or tasks so they get actioned? ... For Serial No-list, I'm guessing that I could still transcribe those tasks on today's page, and then the notebook remembers the task for me. All previous lists that are NOT today's No-list becomes a Long List, in effect. >><br><br>Yes, I just write them directly onto today's no-list. <br><br>Then as I work the no-list, I may move them into a Outlook reminder for the future, or something like that, if I really don't need to see it for a while.<br><br>If I don't take any action, it just rolls into the "archive" of old pages, as Mark called it. I would tend to pick up those items again pretty quickly:<br><br>-- If they are somewhat urgent (due same week), then they will keep niggling at me for at least a day or two, even if I don't see them. Even if I can't remember the details, I would generally have a nagging feeling that I captured something recently which must be reviewed. So that prompts me to go scan the "archive". I see those tasks again. I can then take action on them if they are ready. If they *aren't* ready, and I am afraid I might forget about them, I can always add an Outlook reminder.<br><br>-- If they aren't especially urgent, then I would tend to pick them up again pretty soon anyway. I generally review the archive at least once or twice a day, which keeps those items in my awareness.<br><br>I really don't think any other kind of special handling is necessary. This approach is really simple and gets the job done.<br><br>Hope that helps!</div>

<div class="content">Yes, thanks. My days have been so busy lately (backlog of work following the government shutdown, plus extra committee work responsibilities) that I have not moved off today's page for the past week. It just hasn't occurred to me!</div>

<div class="content">I'm experimenting with putting deadline tasks in OmniFocus (an electronic planner with reminders) or on a calendar.  Then I can see an ordered list of all of my do-or-die commitments and dates.  This is the only thing that will calm my brain.</div>

<div class="content">For work I’ve been using an outliner to maintain an electronic logbook of my work as I do it. For my kind of work it’s often a lot of thinking and writing helps organize that thinking to either read and clarify in my mind, or make sure I don’t forget details. It’s a great place to write questions “how does this work?” And using the outline features I detail exploring the answer underneath it.<br><br>On-topic I make this  fit the SNoLi pattern as follows: Each day I start a new entry for all the days tasks. I write in a task, write meeting notes, and develop these tasks as described above.  When any task or detail of a task is done, I cross it off.  If I continue a project from a previous day, I don’t move that outline down, but I make a new entry for today, in order to preserve the logbook nature of the outline. <br><br>I have very few deadline tasks so all of them go into one list ordered by date and otherwise not connected to any of this.</div>

<div class="content">I've stopped using an outline, a deadline sheet and anything else other than my Bounce list, a calendar and project reference files. For too long I was worried about missing a deadline and second guessing my intuition, which often resulted in periods of nonconstructive procrastination time, leading to more stress and less production, etc. <br><br>Now deadlines are met, more work gets done and less stress overall. Note this is all new to me (see my Embracing Intuition thread) but so far I have been really happy with the results.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Guessed. I tried to link to it, but squarespace wouldn't accept...<br><br>Basically you write everything down, start from the top pick a task, work on it and then scan in the opposite direction. Work on a task and then scan down again. It really works in making sure all different types of work gets done.</div>
