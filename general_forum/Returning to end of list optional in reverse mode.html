<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I have been working in reverse mode with the requirement of returning to the end of the last after each actioned task being optional and so far I love it. Here's why. Whenever I feel I *have* to work in a certain way, I have a natural resistance to it. Being told, for example, in AF1 that I cannot do something on my last page if I am not there yet makes me want to work the last page all the more. In AF2, my natural desire to do the current tasks on the last page has been indulged but using that mode, I *have* to return to the last page each time. Of course, being that it's an obligation, I don't WANT to. I now have a burning desire to keep moving backward through the list without returning to the end of the list unless I really want to. Giving myself that permission seems to give me a better balance of current tasks and just getting to work. <br><br>So, Mark, do you see any problems in NOT returning to the end of the list every time you've actioned a task in reverse mode but only when I desire to do so?</div>
