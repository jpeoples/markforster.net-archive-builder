<div class="content">Since this is a time-management message board, I wonder if anyone could tell me whether reading Seth Godin is a good use of one's time?</div>

<div class="content">Two things:<br><br>1.) Useful feedback generally follows helpful questions. Broad questions get broad answers. <br><br>Here are the two answers you will probably get:<br><br>Yes.<br>No.<br><br>Being more specific, might be helpful for others to give you better advice.<br><br>2.) Such broad questions, mentioning simply a name or product (often not much of a difference), come across as spam. <br><br>If this is just crawling code then make some attempt to pass the Turing Test.</div>

<div class="content">Norman, why so snarky? It was a simple question. And you, of all people, who can elaborate upon a piece of straw!  Surely you can either a) let me know how you feel about Seth Rodin, or b) bugger off.</div>

<div class="content">Norman - <br><br>How is it possible, with all of your Eastern enlightenment, that you're such a jerk?</div>

<div class="content">Steve, I'd check out his blog first.  It's really good and he's incredibly prolific.<br>My favorite book was "The Dip".  <br>He says in there something like "winners quit, they quit often and they quit fast" - kind of applicable to dismissing I guess.<br><br>Here's a list of his top posts if you want a feel for some of his books.:<br><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/seth" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/seth</a></div>

<div class="content">Gary V. <br><br>"Eastern Enlightenment?"<br><br>Project much?<br><br>Have you ever spent anytime in serious "Eastern" practice with someone who did not come to the practice while passing flowers out at war protests and airports?<br><br>Those old guys who sit long enough that their lower body fall completely asleep, have little time for nonsense. Reality and truth. In fact, they sometimes hit you and call you all kindsa bad names. Really, they do.<br><br>If "snark" is troublesome, God does reality going to really bother you.<br><br>But that is aside the point. We are talking simple netiquette here.</div>

<div class="content">I recently skimmed through the Linchpin book and found it was a good read.  I am not sure if I would buy it.  But it had a few interesting ideas and points.</div>

<div class="content">I find it best to read Norman's responses for content rather than tone. Though in this case I disagree with the assumption that a broad question is necessarily a bad question. You just need to be ready for people to read it different ways:<br>- Is Seth Godin any good?<br>- Is it worth spending precious time watching marketers discussing marketing with marketers?<br>- Other stuff I can't think of right now.<br><br>I would say yes to the first question and "maybe" to the second. It's always good to read good writing, so long as you don't spend more than x minutes a day.</div>

<div class="content">I really enjoyed "Permission Marketing". Always think that stretching your brain is a good use of time !!</div>

<div class="content">The most remarkable thing about these criticisms is that have nil to do with what I say, tone or not.<br><br>Take my advice or not. But your post looked like spam. <br><br>And expecting your reader to fill in blanks you either have not or cannot elaborate is a bit rude and probably not helpful for yourself.<br><br>Ignore the fact I am right regardless of my "tone" or take it and receive more serious treatment of your questions in the future whether here or elsewhere, where such questions would just be pruned or ignored.</div>

<div class="content">I didn't think the question sounded like spam.  I think the problem is that there are so many writings one could read, it is difficult to figure out the wheat from the chaff.  We all have limited time - goodness knows I have loads of books I have bought and just not got around to reading (business reading is going onto my AF list!).<br><br>I've read some Seth Godin and really enjoyed it - but I have a great interest in marketing. Could you see if there are any of these writings in the library that would mean you could skim at no cost?  Otherwise the blog idea is great - many books end up being a round up of blogs.</div>

<div class="content">There's a good audio clip of Merlin Mann interviewing him on 43 folders. Worth listening to.</div>
