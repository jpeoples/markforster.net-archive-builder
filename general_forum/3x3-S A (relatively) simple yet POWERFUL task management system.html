<div class="meta">2011-04-5 5:37</div>
<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Sorry for the absence guys, was lying low for a while ^___^ <br><br>This is a new system I have been using for the past week, and man it ROCKS! I would even venture to say that it may be BETTER THAN SFv.3, IMHO.  No kidding.  So here is the obligatory story, followed by the instructions, and finally my observations.<br><br>-/-<br><br>BACKGROUND<br>Three weeks ago, because I am SO forgetful, I started using a 3"x5" memo notebook as my task list holder so that I can always place it in my pocket instead of forgetting it in a table, shelf, or desk somewhere...*ahem* Anyways since the space in a memo notebook is limited I have to abandon SF, and started using Gerry's USGTM.  <br><br>Now using this TMS opened my eyes to the power of the "Write everything in one place" rule: I have now not lost nor forgotten any important information since then.  A flaw in all of Mark Forster's systems that I learned from this experience is that the AFs in all of their incarnations are not true "grass catchers": you most of the time have to format what you write in the notebook so that the information will fit in one line.  What will happen is that you have to write some information in the AF/SF/DWM notebook, and some in other notebooks, pieces of paper, or electronic devices.  The result: either a laziness to write, or the losing of those pieces of paper, both resulting to loss of information.  USGTM in my memo notebook eliminated that.<br><br>USGTM, however, has one flaw: it is too unfocused.  The three-task system (3TS) can be used to compensate for that, but I found it to be too slow and rigid most of the time, especially when the tasks take time to be finished (as observed by Mark in his review of systems). Besides, I was a bit spoiled by SFv3 with its flexibility and power in finishing tasks.<br><br>Then I wondered: is there a way to improve 3TS? Can I make a 3TS-based task management system that retains its focus on finishing tasks, but at the same time make it more accommodating for urgent tasks like SF? I thought about it, then I tried applying what I have learned in paper-based TMS over the last couple of years...and by golly I think I have done it, a system that's simple, compact enough to be used in a 3"x5" memo notebook, yet as powerful as SFv.3 in handling urgent tasks, even more powerful than SFv.3 in finishing tasks, and much more flexible and dependable.  I call it 3x3-S for "Three times three system," or "Sazan-S" (for the Japanese word for 3x3, as in multiplication), because it applies the "Rule of Three" espoused by the US Marines in three areas: daily goals, tasks, and dismissal.<br><br>Next: Instructions for 3x3-S<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>OVERVIEW OF RULES<br>As I had mentioned earlier, there are three main rules for 3x3-S.<br><br>Rule I: 3 Goals a Day<br>These three goals will help you guide and motivate your actions throughout your day.  These goals are important (for example, when you accomplish these goals, you have done roughly 60-90% of your work for this day; or, these goals may be to catch up with backlogs for the past days) yet doable, able to be finished within the day. <br><br>Rule II: (At Least) 3 Tasks at a Time<br>This is the core of the system. You accumulate at least three tasks at a time to consider for your next tasks to do, and you replenish when only one task is left.  However, I have made some changes so that (1) urgent tasks can be done when needed, (2) distractions from work are minimized, (3) "little and often" is enforced, especially when Rule III is put into play.<br><br>Rule III: 3 Strikes Means Dismissal<br>There is one dismissal rule, which is closely tied to a unique re-writing rule: You can never re-write a task unchanged into 3x3-S, only redefine, and you can only redefine a task 2 times, after which it is dismissed. <br><br><br>DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>Rule I: 3 Goals a Day<br>1. Use the front pages of the notebook as a Capture Section to capture notes, tasks, project plannings, miscellaneous info, doodles, etc.<br><br>2. Use the very last page of the notebook as the 3x3 Page/Section.  Use a new page every start of the day,<br><br>3. On the clean last page, write at the top 3 goals you want to do today.  Close with a double horizontal line below the last item.<br><br>4. Anytime, you can cross out goals that you feel you have done for today. There is no need to replenish these goals until the next day.<br><br><br>Rule II: (At Least) 3 Tasks at a Time<br>1. From your Capture Section, write down three tasks that you feel are ready to be done now, preferably guided by the 3 Goals you have written, on your 3x3 Page below the 3 Goals.  Close with a "cut-off" horizontal line below the last item.  From hence, this is called the Active List.<br><br>2. Anytime, you can write new tasks below the cut-off line.  These tasks are either urgent tasks or "next" tasks.<br>    * Urgent tasks need to be done right away.  You may do it right after writing it below the horizontal line, or even do it without writing.  Just cross it out after doing and return to the Active List.<br>    * "Next" tasks need to be done after closing the current Active List.  They will be added to the next batch of Current Tasks (see Rule III below).<br><br>3. Pick one task in the Active List and do it. <br>    * If the task is done, cross it out with a line.  If there is a next step to be done after completion of the task, you may either note it in your Capture Section or write it below the cut-off line as a "next" task.<br>    * If the task is not done but you have to work on another task within the Current Section, then leave the item as is, do the other task, and return to it later.<br>    * If the task is not done but you have done a task that is neither urgent nor listed in the Current Section within 10 minutes of starting your current task, then <<cross out all remaining tasks in the Current Section and redefine them as detailed in Rule III.>> (NOTE: This penalizes distractions while not neglecting the fact that sometimes we DO need distractions to recollect ourselves during work)<br><br><br>Rule III: 3 Strikes Means Dismissal<br>1. You replenish the Active List in two situations:<br>    * If there is only one task or none left in the Current Section<br>    * (As detailed in the last part of Rule II above) If a task that is neither urgent nor listed in the Active List is done within 10 minutes of starting a task in the Active List.  Example: your current task is "Check Email." While you are checking your email, you decided to look at the Mark Forster forums for a sneak peek 5 minutes into looking at your emails.  Realizing that you have done a non-urgent non-current task within 5 minutes of starting your current task, you cross out ALL your remaining tasks in the Current Section and follow the steps below.<br><br>2. Replenish the Active List.<br>    * Redefine the undone tasks in the previous Current Station and write into the bottom of the list of "next" tasks. (NOTE: Redefine means you change the goals of the task, usually by making the goal more specific or breaking the task into more manageable goals)<br>    * Cross out the remaining tasks in the previous Current Station.<br>    * If there are at least three tasks already listed in the Current Section you are building, close the "next" task list with a cut-off line; this becomes your new Current Section.  (NOTE: Yes, there could be more than three tasks in you next Active List because of the addition of "next" items previously)<br><br>3. Redefined tasks have a number before the listed item, indicating the number of revisions done to it.  <<If you redefined a task 2 times already without finishing the task, and it is again about to be crossed out in another Replenishing of the Active List without being finished, then it is dismissed.>>  Dismissed items may be highlighted, marked, or listed in another part of your notebook, and may be re-entered into the 3x3 Page only after the next Replenishing of Active List.<br><br>4. Return to Rule II step 2 above.<br><br>5. At the end of the day, tear out your 3x3 Pages, then start again from Rule I for the next day.<br><br>Next: Some observations on Sazan-S<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not understanding how that will fit into that size notebook but SF will not. Is it because you can't have 2 side by side columns? You wrote "What will happen is that you have to write some information in the AF/SF/DWM notebook, and some in other notebooks, pieces of paper, or electronic devices." I'm not seeing how your new way avoids that any more than SF. Maybe because you're capture section isn't limited to one line? It still seems that if that was your issue, you could have done what many do and keep that stuff in the back of the notebook, if it fits in there now. <br><br>I like hearing about all the ways people tweak things.</div>

I indent the following lines so it's clear that they're not separate tasks. (still thinking over the rest of your message, this line just caught my attention)</div>

As the USMC will tell you, a mission must be clear and short, e.g. capture Hill 209. <br><br>All the rest of the stuff like enemy intelligence, the timing for food and ammo replenishment, the location of the DZ, timings, the artillery fireplan, etc, goes in the supporting documentation.<br><br>What memories writing that last paragraph brought back!</div>

<div class="content">nuntym,<br><br>Glad you found the usgtm helpful in developing something that works for you.  The rule of writing in one place, has been great for me.  I need to know I have one simple tool with all of my "stuff" in it.  As I recently wrote, for me if I get three important tasks done in a day, I am pretty happy and then can noodle through my notebook cherry picking other tasks.  I would not use goals but tasks when discussing 3T, as I write things I know I can get done in a day.  So I would not have learn to be a great blues guitar player, but improvise the minor pentatonic scale for 15 minutes.  Also please note in the usgtm, you would also have an a-z filing system, so to Mark's comment as a project gets more complicated, you may need files, but you can still use the system to keep you focused on moving the project forward. <br><br>The pdf files for my two ebooks are free on my blog if anyone would like to read them.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>malisa, <br><br><<I'm not understanding how that will fit into that size notebook but SF will not. Is it because you can't have 2 side by side columns?>> <br><br>Not just that.  SF is based on AF1, which requires that you must have at least 25 lines per page.  My narrow-ruled 3"x5" notebook has only 15 lines per page.  To implement SF in this case would mean I have to, let's say, write in two columns at the left hand page for Column 1, and write in two columns at the right hand page for Column 2.  And with such a narrow space for writing, let me tell you: I tried it, and it's not pretty =(<br><br><<You wrote "What will happen is that you have to write some information in the AF/SF/DWM notebook, and some in other notebooks, pieces of paper, or electronic devices."

However, what I found with how I am doing now, my to-dos mingling with notes, info and stuff, is that (1) entering information becomes more spontaneous, and (2) the relationship of the different to-dos with the other stuff becomes clearer, i.e. it is easier to see WHY, WHEN, WHERE, and HOW I have to do those to-dos due to the relationship of the entered information in the notebook.  Planning becomes easier, compared to when I was using SF or any other of Mark's systems.  I remember how I was so bothered with the incorporation of projects into the different incarnations of AF/DWM/SF because somehow planning becomes out of whack for me in using them.  In 3x3-S, I have no problems.<br><br>Or maybe it's due to my personality.  I am one of those people who is never bothered with chaos as long as it was MY chaos; I can still find my stuff in a mess, as long as it was MY mess.  In fact, I think I am more comfortable when my things are in a mess ;p<br><br>-/-<br><br>Lillian,<br><br><<why? I indent the following lines so it's clear that they're not separate tasks.

As the USMC will tell you, a mission must be clear and short, e.g. capture Hill 209.>><br><br>Yes, but from my experiences now, it seems to be better to gather all the supporting information you need before stating the mission, which 3x3-S forces me to do.  You know, maintaining the time delay from stimulus to reaction and stuff ^__^<br><br>-/-<br><br>Gerry,<br><br><<Glad you found the usgtm helpful in developing something that works for you.

Thank you.<br><br><<As I recently wrote, for me if I get three important tasks done in a day, I am pretty happy and then can noodle through my notebook cherry picking other tasks. >><br><br>Exactly! That's why I have Rule I: Although I could say that it is not an absolutely necessary part of this system, the 3 Daily Goals takes advantage of the fact that I rip off the 3x3 Pages every night, and also gives direction and motivation to the formulation and picking of tasks.<br><br><<I would not use goals but tasks when discussing 3T, as I write things I know I can get done in a day.>><br><br>Well, I was thinking of daily goals.  Daily goals are objectives that I want to be done by today, which may be done by one task, or by multiple tasks, but still doable by today.<br><br><<Also please note in the usgtm, you would also have an a-z filing system, so to Mark's comment as a project gets more complicated, you may need files, but you can still use the system to keep you focused on moving the project forward. >><br><br>Actually my choosing of 3x5 notebook size was not accidental: I have filing boxes and tabs for 3x5 index cards that I used in other systems before.  I am using these now to file the papers I have ripped off from my notebook =3<br><br>-/-<br><br>God love you.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>OBSERVATIONS AND MUSINGS<br><br>I. Advantages<br>I have found many advantages of 3x3-S in the week I have using it over other systems that I have tried over the years.  In the following discussions, I will regularly compare it to SFv.3 (sorry Mark) because, honestly, SFv.3 is the best paper-based task/time management system I have ever used until 3x3-S.  <br><br>1. Simplicity and intuitiveness<br><br>3x3-S of course cannot be compared in its simplicity to USGTM or 3TS, but in my opinion it is as simple as SFv.3, and I think it can be made even more simple once the rules have been reexamined and tweaked.<br><br>Also, in my opinion it is quite intuitive once you understand why the rules are there.  Alan Baljeu once wrote that certain systems feel more "natural", more "sensible," because these systems can be explained quite readily to ordinary people without sounding weird to them.  3x3-S in my opinion also applies here.<br><br>3x3-S: Know what you want by the end of today, then take notes, then focus on at least three things at a time from those notes that need doing right now, guided by the goals you've set for yourself earlier, while not neglecting the urgent tasks that come your way.  If you find you cannot do those things, simplify until either you can, or dismiss them as a waste of time.<br><br>Sensible, isn't it?<br><br>2. Complete, portable, flexible, spontaneous, and intuitively and objectively focused<br><br>USGTM ensures that you have complete relevant information on your fingertips everytime, and is completely portable when you use it with a small notebook.  USGTM, in my use, also is a good way of knowing your progress, of where you are exactly in your work, because of the relationship of information you have written in the notebook.  Lastly, since there is not much need to format what you write on your notebook (heck, you can doodle and make poems in the notebook, if you like), you can be more spontaneous in making notes.  However, the tasks are all jumbled up and you need some way of focusing on what you need to do like 3TS, yet 3TS is too much of a blunt instrument.<br><br>SFv.3 and the other AF systems are, true to their names, superb in focusing oneself on what intuitively needs to be done next, but sometimes you need a way of overviewing your progress, and with SF/AF this can be hard to do.  Proof of this is the felt need by probably more than a few SF/AF users, like myself, of incorporating projects and project planning into AF/SF with mixed results.  Intuition, you see, needs the guidance of knowledge.  And of course, you need a certain size of notebook for AF1 and SF to work, and you have to format what you write for your list to fit, lessening spontaneity of input.<br><br>Classic time management systems like 7 Habits are superb in giving direction to one's tasks, but at the expense of portability and spontaneity.  <br><br>GTD tries to combine completeness, flexibility, and spontaneity at the expense of intuitive focus and portability.<br><br>Surprisingly, 3x3-S has achieved the completeness, portability and flexibility of input of USGTM, flexibility in handling urgent tasks and intuitive focus of SF, and direction of the traditional TMSs.  It is quite impressive.<br><br><br>3. Powerful in finishing important tasks<br><br>But what is most impressive about 3x3-S is its power in forcing me to finish tasks that NEED to be finished.<br><br>First of all, the three daily goals of Rule I guide me in intuitively picking the tasks I need to do.<br><br>Secondly, Rule II helps me handle urgent tasks as well as plan the tasks I need to do next.<br><br>Thirdly, Rule III forces me to do "little and often" and ignore distractions.  Let me discuss this one further.<br><br>The rule of "3 Strikes means Dismissal" forces "little and often" because it penalizes me for stating a vaguely worded task that takes too long to finish, yet also helps me in redefining it to be easier, shorter, and more defined.  In essence, 3x3-S hates unfinished work: I must either finish it, make it easier to finish, or dismiss it.  As you may imagine, this is powerful in finishing any task or project.<br><br>Finally, the rules of replenishing the Active List (Rule III #1) forces me also to ignore distractions while not neglecting the fact that I DO need distractions to recollect myself during work.<br><br><br>II. Disadvantages<br>There is no such thing as a perfect time management system.  Each system will have its own advantages and disadvantages, the question is whether you are willing to accept the disadvantages in exchange of enjoying the advantages.  For me, the advantages of 3x3-S far outweigh its disadvantages.<br><br>1. Chaos<br><br>USGTM will always have the disadvantage of being a bit disorderly compared to other TMSs, which naturally was transferred to 3x3-S.  In fact, this is worsened by my choice of size of notebook: USGTM calls for the use of "logical groupings," which means to group information by their rough type, for example projects, telephone numbers, notes for a particular meeting, etc.  This is easily done in a larger pad or notebook by devoting one page per type of information.  However, due to the small size of a 3"x5" notebook, this is trickier to do, which is why I more or less abandoned grouping. <br><br>And yet, I never had any problems with it, probably because, as I said in the posts above, of my inherent personality quirk of quickly finding what I want in a jumble of things, as long as it is MY jumble of things.<br><br>2. A bit slower<br><br>A disadvantage directly related to the above one is the slowness in replenishing the Active List.  Because the Capture Section is most assuredly chaotic, choosing the next tasks to be considered from it can be quite slow, especially compared to SF and AF, in which you just skim over the laundry list of tasks.  Add to that the task of redefining unfinished tasks, and it may take a few minutes to replenish the Active List.<br><br>However, I actually find this to be an advantage.  Autofocus is based on respecting the time between stimulus and response: you write what you need to do, then keep it out of sight for a while, then determine whether you need to do it or not later.  This gives the brain some time to digest the over all situation.  3x3-S's replenishing of Active Tasks acts also the same way: it clears the mind of what you have done before, and gives you a little bit of reward for doing a job well done by giving you a breather.<br><br>God love you.</div>
