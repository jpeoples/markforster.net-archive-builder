<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-7 16:14</div>
<div class="content">I'm trying to really simplify things and the one elusive issue I have is what to do with repeating tasks that are date-specific.  For example, I want a reminder to backup my website every Friday.  I don't really need to make an appointment on my calendar for it because it's pretty much a 5 minute job to click through the web page and start the backup.  But if I don't have a reminder somewhere, it will be a month or so before I remember to do that - eeek!  <br><br>On the flip side, putting it on my AF list doesn't work out so well because I am cycling through my entire list in about 3 days (AF2 helped me to get caught up to where my earliest tasks are only about five days behind).  So the backups task actually goes on the chopping block for dismissal about 2 days before it is needed.<br><br>I thought about using another app that does repeating tasks like Toodledo or RTM, but the thought of yet another tool to keep track of is not appealing.  I like the simplification of my calendar and my notebook.<br><br>I am thinking maybe I should put it as an untimed event on my calendar, but not let it repeat...just move it forward to the following week when it's complete.  That would reduce clutter on my calendar (Google Calendar) but still leave the reminder.  I'm just afraid if I actually implemented this that I'd have a lot of "all-day" events scattered through out my calendar that make it cluttered anyway.<br><br>Anyone have any thoughts on this?<br><br>And while I'm thinking out loud...I've been experimenting with blocking off time on my calendar for specific projects.  I've been tagging tasks in my work notebook with a 3-letter client code in all caps so if I have a client file open, I can quickly scan the list for their code and find their tasks.  This works well in theory, but scheduling the project doesn't seem intuitive to me.  <br><br>Yesterday, for example, I had planned to work on project ABC for 3 hours in the afternoon but before that time block rolled around, I ran across something that needed attention on project XYZ so I just went ahead and worked on XYZ until I came to a stopping point and then I worked on ABC for 2 hours or so.  So I feel like I did the right thing by altering my schedule to accommodate XYZ, but the scheduling part seemed like a waste since I had to change it anyway.  I guess what I like about the schedule is that it gives me an idea of what I need to focus on and it keeps me from overbooking (all my projects are based on estimates that I provide the client so I know about how much time I need to block off per project).  It also helps for billing purposes to see the time blocks on my calendar for each client and it is helpful for estimating when I will complete a project.<br><br>Anyone have any thoughts on this?</div>

<div class="content">Doable, for example: Use a secundary google calendar that is not displayed, put the task on it with a reminder to the mailbox.</div>

<div class="content">Damien - great idea! I hadn't thought about the email reminder...  Perfect solution for my tasks. :)<br><br>Now...to schedule or not to schedule...</div>

<div class="content">For scheduling, I use my 'weekly grid'.  This is a tasklist with 7 columns to mark the days of the week.  <br>- Exercising is on it,  I expect 5 sessions a week (I don't care when).  So at the end of the week I expect to see five marks. <br>- Other activities are marked with planned and done half hour blocks (pommodores). <br>- Even AF is there,  to indicate if I worked on my list that day.</div>

<div class="content">Damien,<br><br>Yes, that is exactly the what I would have suggested!<br><br>Gretchen: <br><br>Note, too, that if you make a calendar and have it "hidden", I.e. not highlighted, there is an added bit of functionality that really saves time. When you click on a day to add a task to YOUR calendar just as you normally do, there is a selection box for WHICH calendar to add the even to! Thus you can specify the other hidden calendar to add the event to, it will never show up on your calendar view, and it will email you at the proper time.<br><br>Of course you do need to change the "Reminder" settings on the new calendar. Perhaps a default 30 minutes by email. One more thing. . . it might be useful to give the new hidden calendar a evocative name: <br><br>simple, "tasks" ;<br><br>aristocratic: "butler"; <br><br>passive-aggressive: "nag"<br><br>obscure: "finger string"<br><br>-- Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the tips.  I already use google calendar extensively and I was thinking at first that the work tasks would go on my pre-existing work calendar, personal tasks on the personal calendar, etc.  The idea of creating a single "tasks" calendar that I could hide hadn't occurred to me until Damien posted.  I've already set this up and am adding in tasks to it now.  I think this is going to be a very workable solution.  It keeps all my tasks out of site but not forgotten since the reminders are set and my appointment calendars are visible.  :)<br><br>I'll check out the grid idea, too.  ;)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gretchen<br><br>Low tech. does it for me.<br><br>I just use the tickler file.  An A6 card (or an A4 sheet) for every task that recurs less often that every 3-4 days.  (AF deals directly with more regularly recurring tasks.)<br><br>This way I can just reinsert the card every 5, 10, 15, 20 days, monthly, bi-monthly, yearly etc.  (This is especially useful if I want to do something on about the same day in every month).  I can reword the task whenever I want.  I can include instructions on the card as to how to do the task.  I can throw away the card whenever the task is no longer required.  I can include addresses, phone numbers, personal details.  Some of my cards contain everything that is relevant to a small project.<br><br>"Empty Tickler" is a part of my daily routine. Usually more than half of the items are done on the spot and the rest are entered into AF.  <br><br>I rarely use my calendar for any tasks that are not time specific.<br><br>I have never found a higher tech. solution that serves me nearly as well as my tickler.</div>

<div class="content">For a complete description of the system Jim is describing, read that Sidetracked Home Exectuive's book.  Basically they describe a 3x5 card system in a box with 43 dividers, colored cards, and lots of stuff like that.  But Jim's description captures the essence of it.  Pretty simple and efficient.  And if you HAVE to use a computer, you could easily implement the same idea in just about any program you have: ListPro, Word, Excel, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mike<br><br>If anyone does not know about tickler files google can help.<br><br>I would not be satisfied with a something that restricts me to 3x5 cards.  A system that allows A4 size offers much more flexibility.  (And I would not worry about coloured cards either).

<div class="content">For me 43 folders are the better mouse trap: it doesn't work for me and I always want to improve it. <br>- 43 folders needs daily caring<br>- 43 is too big: What's in there? I can lose track of much paper in 43 folders.<br>- 43 is too small: In August I need a folder for next August,  so maybe thirteen months and 32 days.<br>- 43 folders never heard about weeks and weekdays.  <br>I came up with 20 folders:  this and next week weekdays (14), this and next week -month - year (6).  But I only used it for 3 weeks. <br>Maybe a sequential list, using a spontaneous sticking out system, I could call it AF, Auto Folder ...! Wait! ... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Damien<br><br>Just a couple of points:<br><br>1. In August, do not forget you have a folder for next August because you ran this year's August folder into the daily folders at the beginning of this month.<br><br>2. You are absolutely right about it's need for daily caring.  If you forget to empty it every day, you could miss something and if it were important you might stop trusting the system and it is useless to you.<br><br>3. Mostly you do not need to keep track of what is in the 43 folders.  If you manage it carefully, the items will only come up when you want them.  You just file and forget.<br><br>4. You can cater for weekdays in the following week simply by having a "bulldog" clip with the day on it facing you at the top of each file for the next 7 days.  (There are pictures of this in some of the photos of tickler systems on Google.)</div>

<div class="content">One can also do a list to keep track of things, no?  I mean, what is really the advantage of filing the actual paper in so many places.  Why not file the paper in its proper home (in the folder for the XYZ account, for example) and just keep track of due dates in a tickler LIST of some kind.  This basically comes down to a reminder system.  I'm just playing with the notification feature of Google Calendar it so far it seems to do a nice job of sending SMS messages to my phone for things due.<br><br>I have this beautiful 3x5 card system (lots of nice colors and all) that I set up about 20 years ago which I don't use.  I also have a "bin" of 43 folders I set up at the same time that I don't use any longer.  I have not been moved to set up a 43 system for anything in some time simply because reminder systems abound and seem to work so well.  I'd not bother looking into Google except that Google seems to becoming the center for all things computing ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Ooops, I guess the original poster was asking about a completely paper method.  I can't fathom why anyone would want to ignore alarm clocks in this day and age (and that is really what tickler's are, in essence) but ...<br><br>All one needs for a tickler list is a sheet of paper with dates on it.  If it gets so long that it is hard to scan for the right date, one can begin to break it down a bit to keep the dates sorted.  This gets a bit into the 43 system but one would have to have a lot of ticklers to need to do the whole 43 thing.  I mean, you'd have to be running a retail business that books appointments or something ... then you'd use an appointment calendar.<br><br>But I REALLY suggest that ticklers be handled mostly by electronic reminder, with some key notes on paper.  Personally, I just write them on a sheet of paper in my book and as soon as I'm near the computer I put them into the reminder system. That gives me backup.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>If it works for you, then that's great.  But let me tell you how horribly wrong it CAN go.  My brother was a lawyer.  He felt that if something was "due" he had to have the physical file in a pile for that day.  Well, his desk, his credenza, his office couch, all of the chairs, the floor around the desk and all over the office was piles and piles of case files.  Of course, when paper came in, his staff wasted lots of time searching for the files to file the paper.  It was just awful.  When I suggested a list of dates and the files back into the cabinets where they belonged, he turned white.  He felt that if he did not have the physical file right in front of his nose he would miss a filing deadline.<br><br>So, that's where I'm coming from.  What you need in a tickler system is a reminder of what is due, not the physical thing that is due.  It is my old refrain, I guess .... systems should have integrity of purpose. Files are for filing, lists are for reminding.  (At least tickler lists are ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>Your brother sure had a crazy system, but, of course, his system had nothing to do with a 43 folders tickler system.<br><br>You ask why not put things where they "belong" and in their "proper home".  But there are numerous things for which the 43 folders is the "proper home".  I think of things that are hard to classify and find a more suitable home for.  Things that you are pretty certain that you will not want to look at until the folders bring them forward on the appropriate date.  Things that have bits of information on them that would not be available if they were transferred to a list.  In all, I found, a little time back, that I actually had some 200 items in my 43 folders.  There is no way that I could devise a "list" that would serve the purpose of representing all these items and the information contained in them.  <br><br>Other people leave these kinds of items <br>-on the fridge door<br>-on their desk<br>-on pinboards around the office or home<br>-on the computer desk<br>-on their dressing table   <br>or anywhere else where they can make sure they do not forget them.<br><br>I have to agree with you that sometimes it is an inappropriate decision to bury an item in a 43 folder file system if it is more efficient to always file it in a particular and predictable place and to have a separate reminder to point to that place at the appropriate time, but I found after experimenting with the 43 folders for some 6-7 years that there is a surprisingly large number of things for which the folders seem to be the best place.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Your brother is not unique - I used to do a lot of work with law firms in the UK and in the US and immediately recognised the description of your brother's office.  It was not unusual to turn up for a meeting and for every chair to be piled high with nearly toppling files and for the lawyer to be hunting for a patch of floor space to move them to!!<br><br>Now if there was ever a totally non-paperless industry ..............<br><br>It was when I used to have to work on or inspect case files that got me - there I'd be in a nice conference room and be presented with box after box after box of files ........ ugh!!  And if there was ever a problem of UK English vs US English - well ..........<br><br>I can never quite believe some of the words that have stayed in US usage but have to say that my favourite word ever is American - although I have heard it used here recently ......... DISCOMBOBULATION!  Great word - sums up a lot of my pre AF days perfectly :-)</div>
