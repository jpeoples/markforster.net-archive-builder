<div class="content">Let's say I am working on Page 1.  I stop working on a task.  It is unfinished.  So, I need to re-enter it on page 2, column 2.<br><br>But, page 2, column 2 is already full.  <br><br><br>This is a problematic situation, obviously, and is a likely indication that I have been abusing Column 2.  But in the meantime, while I learn to treat Column 2 with more respect, I need to know where to write things.  <br><br>Perhaps a rule addendum could be made: <br><br># if the task is not finished, delete it in the same way. Re-enter it in Column 2 on the next page.  If Column 2 on that page is already full, then you must rewrite the task in such a way as to allow you to enter it on Column 1 of the last active page.<br><br><br>Or alternately (with a little more concession to the Column 2 abuser):<br><br># if the task is not finished, delete it in the same way. Re-enter it in Column 2 on the next page.  If Column 2 on that page is already full, then re-enter it in Column 2 of the next page that still has room in Column 2.  If NO pages have room in Column 2, you must rewrite the task in such a way as to allow you to enter it on Column 1 of the last active page.<br><br><br>In other words, you really must reconsider the way you are breaking down your projects and how many tasks you allow to be called "urgent".  These rule addenda force you to do that, if you are a Column 2 abuser.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I'm not sure what you think is wrong with the present rule that you enter the task on the first page on which Column 2 is not full. <br><br>If you are saying that, due to the Column 2 abuse, *all* the Column 2s are full then I think the new rule should be that in that case you have to start your list again from scratch and use the list more sensibly in future.</div>

That rule appears to have been omitted from the February 10th summary of the rules.  ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html</a> )<br><br>If that's the rule, then I like it.   <br><br><br><<<If you are saying that, due to the Column 2 abuse, *all* the Column 2s are full then I think the new rule should be that in that case you have to start your list again from scratch and use the list more sensibly in future. >>><br><br>Yeah, I was trying to address that situation also.  That's a good approach, too.  <br><br>My addendum (namely, "if the task is not finished, delete it in the same way. Re-enter it in Column 2 on the next page. If Column 2 on that page is already full, then re-enter it in Column 2 of the next page that still has room in Column 2. If NO pages have room in Column 2, you must rewrite the task in such a way as to allow you to enter it on Column 1 of the last active page.") would accomplish nearly the same thing after a short time.  Since all your Column 2s are full, each of your active pages will get processed only ONE more time before all the column 1s are dismissed and column 2s are completed, and you'll effectively start over with a new book (and some dismissed stuff).</div>

<div class="content">How can no pages have room for column two? Is there an end to the list somewhere? <br><br>There clearly comes a point when you have broken the system because you can no longer rely on getting to a column 2 task quickly: when making meaningful progress on the column two tasks prior to your last page of column 2 entries is going to take longer than your working period (say half a day). <br><br>If you ever get to that point, everything urgent needs to be done at once according to the common sense rule and because there is nowhere to park it. I guess one urgent task is renegotiating your commitments. <br><br>But even I haven't got there yet.</div>

<div class="content">There's only 2 pages of column 2 entries: the current page and the next page. On the next page are only those that you just recently worked on. So there's no such thing as urgent tasks you can't get to for half a day.</div>

It part and parcel to the fact that the pages live in a closed RING of Page 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 ......  I'm not sure the wrap around nature of the ring is clear in the condensed instructions and was going to point that out.<br><br>If Pages 3 and 5 are full then the ring is ....<br><br>Page 1 2 4 6 1 2 4 6 1 2 4 6 <br><br>I've also taken to one habit; If I do a recurring task that is a roughly weekly item; I will renter it on column one of a NEW PAGE even if the last page isn't full. I however will not use column two on that page until column one on the proceeding page is full; That seems to keep my active pages more lean and moving along.<br><br>Also being a sloppy writer I'm using $2 spiral StenoPads for this system; that keeps my columns 1 and 2 nice and neat; when I dismiss a page if I choose I can tear it our of the book if that makes sense....</div>

<div class="content">I was just thinking steno pads would be perfect because they already have a line right down the middle. I'm not liking the moleskine I got. Too small and the gel pens I use smear on the smooth paper.<br><br>As for weekly recurring tasks, I put them in Outlook so it pops up, and then I write them in column 2 as an urgent task.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Don,<br><br>Using Outlook is a fine idea.  However, it seems odd to consider a weekly recurring task as urgent.  What if the time isn't good to act on it when Outlook chimes?  I'd instead add it as a new non-urgent item.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br><<<it seems odd to consider a weekly recurring task as urgent.>>><br><br>I have been doing this, too.  For example, every Monday I run a team meeting and need to send out the agenda on Friday.  So I set up a recurring Outlook reminder, "SAF 2c: Agenda for Monday".   When the reminder pops up, I write the task in my current second column.  That way, I MUST get the agenda started before leaving the page.<br><br>Mark's definition of "urgent" for the purposes of column 2 entry is "if you want to get to it before you would in the normal processing of your list".   That's definitely the case for me here.<br><br>I worried about overburdening Column 2 with this kind of stuff, but so far it's working great!<br><br>(Note that I also have some recurring reminders that trigger me to enter things into the first column -- but sometimes the second column works better, as in the case I described.)</div>

<div class="content">I do the same but on ical (my diary) I put a recurring task and report it on C2 asap.<br>I also have a little morning process ie check my emails, have a look at my diary (on 3 weeks) and i report everything which must be on SF then i read the all list without intention of doing and after i rush<br><br>anyway if C2 is full i report it on the next active page C2</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>The examples I have are turning in a timesheet and status reports on Friday. I really want to do them on Friday because that is when they are due and if I don't, I end up worrying about them all weekend.<br><br>So I have Outlook popup each Friday with those items. I actually used to use Outlook reminders as my "urgent" list. I would just keep postponing them, and then finally dismissing the reminders when they were done. As you can imagine, I'd get in the habit of letting the list grow without taking action. So now I just use the reminders to remind me to put things into SF.</div>
