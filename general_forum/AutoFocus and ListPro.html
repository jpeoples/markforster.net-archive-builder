<div class="content">Mark F stated at the start he is also interested in electronic approaches.  After using a manual notebook method from 6 January, a very brief foray with MLO sucked me into trying to make it perfect (one of the reasons, I think, for my own procrastination) until I realised I was spending too much time on it.<br><br>I have to say that I am very happy with my early efforts with ListPro.  As fellow ListPro user/recommender Laurence mentioned, it IS easy and quick to use and I recommend it to others Interested enough to try the electronic avenue.<br><br>What I really like is the ability to hide my checked/completed tasks (which include those I have copied to Outlook to remind me later or set up a hard due date in the Outlook Calendar) so that only the outstanding items are on display on my screen page (24 per page because I increased the size of the default font).  This visible shrinking feature has been mentioned by other testers as a nice sign of progress.  Using a Status column helps identify those items I "Defer to Do Later" usually because of my current Context/place, but I have to watch this category in case it's used to procrastinate unduly!  The contexts help me with batching and focusing; my contexts are: @Assignment/Client, @Home, @Home Office, @Travel/Airport/Lodge.<br><br>I haven't yet decided to set alarms in ListPro as I still like Outlook for some other facets of trying to be more effective and efficient.  The reminders and scheduled tasks from ListPro which I copy to Outlook means that I can check them off in ListPro (thereby shrinking the page) and know that I will be reminded so that they can rewritten into the last page of AF, if required.  I still use features of Michael Linenberger's Total WorkDay Control in my Outlook configuration, mainly for the MUST DO on/by a specified date tasks.<br><br>So my current AF hybrid is:  ListPro on my Toshiba notebook, synchronised with ListPro on my Pocket PC Phone (an HTC P3600), and a pocket notebook to scribble tasks in if I have neither the Toshiba nor the HTC to hand.  I'm going to try to stay with this for some time, but a possible future hybrid may include the upcoming Asus 8.9" Tablet NetBook which could see me using it as the primary device (size and form factor great for meetings and travelling in cattle class).<br><br>See <a href="http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/lp/listpro.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/lp/listpro.php</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger<br><br>Guess you're on you way back from Zambia now so will be looking forward to busy but unstressed AF week!<br><br>It's interesting reading your and other's comments regarding the electronic options for AF.  I know that if I tried to make something fit with a handheld device I would definitely have spent too long on it, hence my love affair with OneNote in that it mirrors my paper option.  One thing that strikes me from the various postings is the wish to show only outstanding items on a virtual page.  I can certainly understand the wish for this on a handheld with it's small screen, but for me, part of the benefit of the "physical" (or full screen duplicated) page, is the fact that when you scan that page you are automatically recognising that there are a number of completed tasks.  It seems to me that that in itself increases the motivation and that therefore this aspect could be lost in such a virtual adaptation.<br><br>The more I work with AF the more the "hidden" attributes of the system's working become more evident.  Much as I love the concept of structure - and even aspire to extreme levels of organisation :-) , that type of system has always had it's drawbacks for me and consequently increased my levels of procrastination.<br><br>I think it is clear from the forum that as individuals we thrive on various levels of structure, some requiring a high degree of structure and others for whom that very structure creates the problem.<br><br>It makes me wonder how much of our desire for structure is natural, how much is  learned and how much comes from a sense that we "ought" to have structure.  I have no idea as to the answer - just a few thoughts to throw into the pot ............. :-)<br><br>Hope you have a good trip back, Roger</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>Still a week to go, only leave on Friday, lots to do with or without AF!<br><br>I have a ton of stuff to sort out at home due to various family issues, so my Personal list is filling up fast so i don't forget.<br><br>Also, if I do tire of electronic for whatever reason, I know my manual one also works.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Roger J.: Would you mind sharing your AutoFocus ListPro template? I'm using ListPro as well, and would happily share but maybe your template is more useful? If you don't want to publish it, then maybe you could send it to me by mail (I'll give you my email address)?<br><br>Anyway it's nice to see another happy ListPro user :)</div>
