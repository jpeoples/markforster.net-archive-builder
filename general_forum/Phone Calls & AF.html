<div class="content">As a salesman, every night I check any new leads that my Asst. has sent to me via the CRM Salesforce.com. My plan was to jot those names and numbers in my AF notebook and work on them the next day. If I call a lead, but go into voicemail what would I do next in AF? Rewrite the same information at the end of the list? Put a "waiting for return call by X " on the list? Or should I keep all calls separate?</div>

<div class="content">I think the question is, do you want the system to prioritise amongst your leads (so put them each into AF) or to prioritise the time you spend on leads in total against your other priorities (single task, "work new leads" + a list of leads).<br><br>As I'm not a sales professional, I'm not sure I can answer that question as well as you can. <br><br>You might also want to prioritise between 1st calls, chasing voice messages and other types of call. (references in AF to different lists. But then it's beginning to get a bit clever...<br><br></div>
