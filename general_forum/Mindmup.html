<div class="content">I would like to draw attention to an app I have recently discovered.  Perhaps it's old news.<br><br>It's called Mindmup (sic), and it runs in a tab of Google's Chrome browser.  Versions are also available for iOS and Android, though I haven't tried them.  Your information is stored on the Google drive, but the software can run without internet access, resynchronising when a connection becomes available.  There are options for more than one person to use it collaboratively.  It's free.  <br><br>It provides a very intuitive way of producing a mindmap, with shortcuts that make it rarely necessary to take one's hands off the keyboard.  Subtrees can be folded (collapsed) and expanded by pressing F.  <br><br>It has a few embellishments, one of which is directed at making an outline for a presentation.  Pressing S splits the screen to show a storyboard; pressing + adds items from the mindmap to the storyboard, and - removes them.<br><br>I use the program make a hierarchical to do list.  I then move a handful of nodes to the story board and make those items my focus for the next day or so.  I find it simple and rather effective.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you!! I'm new to AF and I've got a lot of ideas flying around in my head. As much as I appreciate the simplicity of a linear list, right now I think a mind map would be more helpful in keeping some of my ideas in context until I can organize them better.</div>
