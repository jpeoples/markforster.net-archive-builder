<div class="content">I really believe that an immense amount of credit must go to Mark for not only identifying the need for a system like AF but being able to produce it, and not just as a system that works for him but to a degree that is entirely replicable among so many.  How many beta tests of anything have resulted in such overwhelming appreciation, where it seems that the only changes will be to the instructions as opposed to the system itself?!<br><br>I have been very appreciate of the nice comments I have had through this forum, but the only way I have been able to do any posts - or felt any wish to become involved in a Discussion Forum - is purely down to the fact that AF *has* enabled me to focus, and my participation has definitely arisen out of the incredible excitement generated by the realisation that actually, there really is a solution to *my" Time Management issues.  Participation in this forum has been, for me, an incredible part of the learning curve; I am learning as I go along, and the credit has to go to Mark for producing a system that can have such an effect.    <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Christine<br><br>I second that.<br><br>These days when so much os over-engineered (yes, I work in IT) I think the strangth of the system lies in the simple implementation.<br><br>The concepts behind this are certainly not simple (I had never heard of structured procrastination!) so credit Mark for identifying the issues with existing time management systems, the underlying causes of those issues, and coming up with an elegant solution.<br><br>Rgrds,<br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>As I say at the beginning of the instructions, this system is the result of everything I know about time management. But one of the things I know about time management (and other things as well) is that the best motto is "Simplify!"</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I always remember a bushcraft instructor repeating something that I've heard the military hold dear, KISS - "Keep It Simple, Stupid". That's always stayed with me. So much in this world is overcomplicated and so something as simple and elegant as Autofocus is a joy to receive.<br><br>Many thanks Mark</div>
