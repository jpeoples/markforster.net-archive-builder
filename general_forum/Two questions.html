<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-7 17:52</div>
<div class="content">I have two questions about AUTOFOCUS.<br><br>1) What if there is an item on my list which I don't need to do today or even this week but that I won't on my list (i.e. I have to call my accountant next week and I have to pay my credit card bill next week).  Does these items have any place on the list and if so where , and what happens if I get to one of them and I realize -- "this can wait until next week"<br>2) what about "hard items" on the list.  I have to make a phone call at 4 p.m. Obviously I can't do this item until 4 p.m.  What if it's 2 p.m. and I'm already done with every other item on the page.<br><br>I'm sure I'll have more questions later but any help with these would be most appreciated.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>The instructions cover both these points:<br><br>1) You need some form of diary or reminder to enter these types of tasks. <br><br>2) You should not use Autofocus for tasks which have specific times.</div>

<div class="content">I was prompted by Autofocus to redesign my method of scheduling as it was a little haphazard.  If a new timed event comes up, or if I recall an event that I had previoulsy forgotten to schedule, I write it on my list as "schedule [event xxx]"  The scheduling of it then not only completes a task, but also ensures I record everything in my new designated scheduling location, and also helps to fix it in my mind.  I also have a task "check schedule" which gets done and re-entered periodically.</div>
