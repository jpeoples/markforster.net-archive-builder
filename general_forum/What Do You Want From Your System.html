<div class="content">The title of this post is taken from a question Alan Baljeu recently asked.<br><br>My answer is twofold. I want my system to be a system, that is, to organize my tasks. And, I want it to motivate me to do those tasks.<br><br>In this post, I will assume that the "system" requirement of the system is noncontroversial.<br><br>From Norman's "intuition" thread, it appears as if the "motivation" requirement is controversial.<br><br>In English as plain as I can make it, my hope is that I will be more likely to do tasks that I know are good for me if I use the system than if I don't use the system. When this hope is satisfied, I find that the system motivates me.<br><br>DWM really gets me motivated. And not in the sense that Mike uses "motivated." If I understand him correctly, he says he is motivated when he feels like he wants to do something. What I like about DWM is that it gets me to do things precisely when I don't feel like I want to do them. It gets me to do them anyway.<br><br>And, of course, 99% of the time, 15 seconds after starting to do them, I feel like I want to do them.<br><br>For me, of the two desiderata--organization and motivation--the latter easily overshadows the former in importance and power. <br><br>So, to answer Alan's question, I want a system that will get me organized and get me motivated. And I would gladly sacrifice organization for motivation. And DWM is a good system for me, because it gets me to do the things that I know are good for me and that I avoided doing pre-DWM.</div>

<div class="content">I want my system to be my memory (which on its own is very colander-like) and to help me see things through to completion.  I am a great starter of projects but a lousy finisher.<br><br>Currently I'm using DWM but all of Mark's systems have served each of these purposes better than any other task-management system I've ever tried.</div>

<div class="content">Good question :-) I want a system that helps me<br>- focus on my priorities<br>- track 'everything' that needs doing<br>- see progress<br>- actually do useful stuff<br><br>af4 gives me 2,3, and 4 extremely well.<br>But it focuses on the closed list (ignored stuff) when I want to focus on important stuff. <br>Dwm does about the same. It's a little more emphasis on recent activity, but it puts a clock on unimportant things.  DIT looks like it's better at focus, but it doesn't cover the everything well.</div>

<div class="content">I don't really need a system to motivate me to do things. And even if I did, I don't think that would be successful long-term (why don't I want to do them anyway?). What I really need is something that helps me focus, and helps me avoid the twin dangers of:<br>1) being so overwhelmed with tasks that I can't decide what to do next<br>2) Getting so absorbed with one thing that everything else goes out of the window (or hyperfocus, as some others here would probably call it)<br><br>DWM and AF achieve both admirably - I can focus on the task in hand knowing that everything else is not being 'lost', and the system makes sure that I keep catching those tasks which I might otherwise forget when I get stuck into a big, absorbing task.<br><br>On top of that, they are almost minimalist enough to be not 'really' a system. This is important to me: if I ever feel that the 'system' overhead is taking up a chunk of my time, or that it is 'forcing' me do things that I don't really want to do, I rebel, and then I'm back to square one.</div>

<div class="content">I want my system to:<br><br>Capture everything that needs doing (one Steno notebook for business, one for personal)<br><br>track my appointments and contacts (outlook w/blackberry)<br><br>allow me to retrieve the things I need (simple a - z filing system)<br><br>This is now all I ask of my system, I leave motivation and what to process up to my intuitive mind.  Since, I focused on this simple system, I find I am more productive and less distracted by tweaking and searching for the perfect system, since I don't think there is one.<br><br>I love the steno notebooks, they are cheap portable and being left handed easy to use.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Moises, I think that's the problem I had with all the AF offspring eventually. At first, it was new and fun and I was motivated to see how many pages I could close out. But it wasn't long before no one cared about that, including me. The other problem was I often found myself motivated to do the wrong things. There is often a good reason we are procrastinating. AF and its descendants CAN get us considering that, but it offers very little guidance outside of pushing one's self to do things. <br><br>The more I've thought about it, my mostly listless system accomplishes what I want it to. The things that get done are those that I feel motivated to do, people are bugging me about, and/or that I remember to do. The rest probably wasn't worth doing. Again, the exception here is when there's a deadline or something I need to do for someone else that I'm likely to forget. All go on my calendar or Gootodo list. An example. When using AF, I would list "Read Book A." I would come round to it and find that it was easier than the other tasks on the list so I'd spend a bit reading Book A. Honestly, though, if I have to have a list remind me to read a book, it's just not something I want to read. In fact, the more pressure I feel in seeing that task on the list repeatedly, the LESS I want to read it. <br><br>Not trying to argue against something that works for you or others! I am just trying to understand better what works for me.</div>
