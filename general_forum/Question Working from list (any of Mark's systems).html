<div class="content">I'm back (as always) to DWM. <br><br>Question: Have you discovered how often you need to work from your list(s) to ensure they (the system) stays relevant and useful?  My hunch is that Mark's ability to work entirely from his list - work, breaks, leisure, etc - ensures that his lists are a huge part of his day. Yet I'm not sure I have that level of discipline. Thoughts or ideas on how you make this work?</div>

<div class="content">I think a couple times a week is necessary, amounting to several hours.  I don't think total discipline is required, not even close.</div>

<div class="content">A couple of times per week? I'm pretty sure that wouldn't work for DWM.</div>

<div class="content">I find it doesn't really require discipline.  Instead, it requires structuring your life in such a way that the best method is also the path of least resistance.<br><br>For example, I always struggled with finding a pen.  I hated keeping one in my pants pocket because it would always poke a hole in the pocket.   But most of my shirts didn't have shirt pockets.   <br><br>I finally got sick enough of this, that I bought a dozen shirts with shirt pockets, and got a box of nice Zebra F-301 pens that fit in the pocket.   Now I always have a pen.   Believe it or not, this had a big effect on how consistently I use my DIT notebook.<br><br>Sometimes these silly little things can really hold us back.   All it takes is a little restructuring, and the discipline just falls into place.</div>
