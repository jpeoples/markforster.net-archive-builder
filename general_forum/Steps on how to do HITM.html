<div class="content">Stay stupid.  Be compulsive.  Have faith.<br><br>1) Any smart person would realize the length and arduousness of your list and would not even touch it.  A dumb person would not only think about how long and hard it is but would be cocky enough to believe he can do the list anyway.  Ignorance and arrogance are your friends.  Do not think, never brood: dot it, then do it. <br><br>2) Not only should you not think in choosing and doing tasks, but even in stopping.  The moment you feel you have to stop, do not think about it: stop!  Then choose, then do.<br><br>3) Believe in the righteousness of what you are doing.  Believe in that something that we cannot see, nor hear, nor taste, nor even sometimes feel that is doing the "standing out" for you.  It is not magic, and thus it does need the data that you give it, but intuition is real.  Believe in it.<br><br>And yes this was inspired by "Do the Work" by Steven Pressfield.<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Do-Work-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B00NK0MJBK" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Do-Work-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B00NK0MJBK</a><br><br>Pressfield believes in the existence of Resistance.  I do too.  But I think HITM has a great approach on how to deal with it: outrun it.</div>

<div class="content">Great post!<br>It really is that simple - just do it!<br>I notice even with simple scanning and standout etc, there are still things that get too old for my liking.<br>1st New Years resolution - scan/action around the 10% oldest things on the list first thing each day, then carry on as before.</div>

Stop it.<br><br>Alan Baljeu: <<But where do you describe HITM?>><br><br>Right now it exists as Simple Scanning because apparently there's no system better than it in using HITM's principles.</div>
