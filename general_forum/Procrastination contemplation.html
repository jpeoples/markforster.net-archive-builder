<div class="content">Cricket, the procrastinating mind is choosy. If the delaying tactic is too obvious it gets rejected. The trick is to choose a plausible excuse not to do it. >:-}</div>

<div class="content">Science has recently caught up with what most of us already know (or know is true for ourselves, and are relieved it's true for most others as well). When you leave a room, the brain changes or resets. We often forget why we went to the new room. When home, I'm quite capable of forgetting that I already tried to do it at the office. (Well, I was. Somehow that excuse isn't as effective now that I work at home.)</div>

<div class="content">Another one ...<br>"I'm too frazzled, I'll sleep early and do it  first thing in the morning"<br><br>I think it's 50:50 that I actually managed to get up early in such cases. :-/</div>

<div class="content">If I can't get up early, then I trust my body. A bad sleep reduces my productivity to almost zero, and it takes days to recover. If I can sleep in, then I do. (And if I'm awake but just can't get out of bed, I remember the mess I usually make of things when I force it. My husband's a programer. I joke that when he's tired things take four times as long. Twice the time to do the work, another time to undo the mess -- it's a huge interconnected program -- and the time to do it right.</div>

<div class="content">I found this spiritually oriented take on it:<br><br>"Procrastination and distraction are two ways the ego self will seek to keep you small. The greater the amount of procrastination you find yourself in and the greater lengths you need to go to to distract yourself are good indicators of the big leap your soul wishes you to take. Do not fall for those old saboteurs, as resistance will only lead to a disempowered, uncomfortable place. Remember, surrender and flow are the way of the empowered human being and move you forward seamlessly, at the perfect speed, with the greatest amount of ease and support possible. "<br><br>- <a href="http://trinityesoterics.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://trinityesoterics.com/</a><br><br>That seems a good summary of what Mark was trying to achieve with all his systems.</div>

<div class="content">I don't normally go in for the "spiritual" stuff, but this makes sense to me:<br>""Procrastination and distraction are two ways the ego self will seek to keep you small. The greater the amount of procrastination you find yourself in and the greater lengths you need to go to to distract yourself are good indicators of the big leap your soul wishes you to take. "<br><br>My offbeat thought: if I could learn to put off procrastination till later would I be a better procrastinator?</div>

<div class="content">We mostly focus on the negative consequences of not doing something and later feel annoyed at ourselves or guilty. But there is emotional attachment to avoidance, distraction, procrastination.<br><br>So "be more motivated" is perhaps better seen as "let yourself be more aware of the current good and less good aspects" that  maintain our avoidance, distraction, procrastination. We often say "be more motivated" but it may be more helpful to see motivation as degree of readiness, created by the perceived balance of good and less good aspects. So, yet another question for the list: "What's close to my tipping point?"</div>
