<div class="content">Observe on the left Mark has completely updated the page on the original AutoFocus system.  There's no room there for comments.  What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">It looks like he has settled on AF1 as THE Autofocus System. I pretty much agree with this.<br><br>The only change I would make is the addition of flags. I wish Mark would try it. By flagging 15-25 tasks that stand out to you out of your entire list, then you're assured you haven't missed anything and you're going to work on the most important things in the beginning of the day. You cycle through the flags just like you would with AF1. When one of the flagged items stands out, do it, and remove the flag (relist the item if unfinished). When all the flags are removed, then proceed with AF1 exactly as stated.<br><br>So, I definitely agree that AF1 is THE Autofocus System.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">The only change to the  pages is that the Simplified Chinese Translations of AFs 1-3 have been moved to a different website.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>The "Autofocus System" link at the top navigation bar still points to a page called "Autofocus Index" <a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/</a> talking about AF1-4. Its blurb on AF1 links back to the page called "Autofocus System" <a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/</a> .<br><br>Per the index, I see that Mark still considers non AF1-4 systems as experimental and non yet worthy of a place (or footnote) in it. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I do something similar, but rather than flags (I assume you mean little post-its sticking out) I use a highlighter. I review the backlog for anything that must be done before I expect to review the list again. The highlighted items become a virtual first page.<br><br>I like to have my urgent tasks on the same page, so if more than one page has highlighted items I often write them on separate list which I keep with the main list and toss when finished.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket,<br><br>>I do something similar, but rather than flags (I assume you mean little post-its sticking out) I use a highlighter. <<br><br>The reason I don't do this is two-fold:<br>1) There exists the possibility that I won't finish all the flagged tasks. If I don't, I don't want today's intuition influencing tomorrow's intuition. If I use a highlighter, then I'm locked in.<br>2) I don't think I would personally like a mixture of unhighlighted, uncrossed tasks; unhighlighted, crossed-out tasks; highlighted, uncrossed tasks; and highlighted, crossed-out tasks in my list.<br><br>In regard to your other point, I don't find flipping through pages to be too taxing – at least it's not as taxing as rewriting tasks on another page.<br><br>But, if it works for you, great! The main thing is that we each find something that works for us.<br><br>Matt</div>
