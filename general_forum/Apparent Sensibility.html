<div class="content">AF4R, as Mark practices it, seems to me to have a quality not seen since Do It Tomorrow:  It feels natural.  The point being, I don't feel silly explaining what I'm doing and why.<br><br>The other systems appeal to time management junkies who examine a system, try it, and learn whether it works.  But few systems can be explained quickly, in every day language, and appeal to people who say, "why not just write things down and do them?"  <br><br>Other systems, I don't think you can begin to explain without having to immediately discuss "weird" stuff like:<br>- rewrite at the end<br>- go through the list in this fashion<br>- enter everything for next month, then do some today.<br><br>=================<br>But for these three, the essence is easy to communicate:<br><br>Do It Tomorrow.  You're busy today, so rather than let new stuff interrupt you, note them for tomorrow to work on.<br><br>Gerry's Ultra Simple Guide. Take notes, and highlight things that need doing.<br><br>AF4R: Keep 3 lists and scan through them regularly:<br>a) Things you might work on, and <br>b) Things you do regularly, and<br>c) Things you are working on.  Try to get these done.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>WAF: You're busy this week, so try to squeeze whatever you can for this week and mark the rest to work on them sometime in the future...or maybe never ^___^<br><br>And I dunno about AF4R: many people dissed the system in LifeHacker =(<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">I think it's a function of how it was explained.  In that case, many people watched the video of AF1, and found it to be an interesting but peculiar system.  None of which speaks to how well it works, but how quick and broad the reception.  I think Mark made the right choice presenting AF4R rather than SAF, for that reason.<br><br>I also think some slight adjustments could make it more approachable.  (Other adjustments, like my introducing "projects" to the lot make it more obscure again.)</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Thanks for the mention of the USGTM, I have not been doing much with my site lately because I have found the simple stuff I am doing works best and I have moved on to other pusuits, but if anyone wants the USGTM or SGTM, please email me and I will send you the pdf for free.  Please mention you are a member of Mark's forum in the email.<br><br>Gerry<br>desiredoutcomes@gmail.com</div>

<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br><br>I have been quiet for some time now -- working with AF4R and seeing how it does in my very busy world.  I am here now to say that it works wonderfully!  I have used all of Mark's systems, but AF4R makes the most sense to me and really allows one to see how much is left undone while new work shows up.<br><br>I still maintain many habits of GTD -- I have a waiting for folder, agenda folders for all of the key people I interact with, a project lists folder, an action support folder, and a waiting for support folder.  All of this combined has created a very efficient system.<br><br>Mark, I read here somewhere where you have changed, or are in the process of modifying again the rules for AF4R.  I think part of it was that one could choose any order of the list categories to work on.  Is this correct?<br><br>Mark -- AF4R is the best system for me yet.  I think I have finally found what works best for me!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I'm not Mark, but here's a response: Good to hear from you again David!  To your questions, Mark has written both of those things:<br>a) He doesn't worry about which order he goes through stuff.<br>b) He's currently working on an improved rule set, although my impression is he's first trying to improve SuperFocus.</div>
