<div class="content">I'm looking to have some kind of balance between new items being written at the bottom of my list, and items being actioned, and am using AF2 handwritten variety.<br><br>I've looked at past threads which have mentioned dots, vertical and horizontal lines, circles, and numerous variations, and want a simple solution.<br><br>I am thinking of writing the date every morning to the left of the first new entry, and using a single dot a la Mark when deciding to action a task. When I stop working on the task I am thinking to cross it out starting from the dot, but only to add the vertical through the dot at the end of the day, when I can count the un-verticaled done ones and compare with the number of new tasks. Does this make any kind of sense? Or alternatively to have single vertical lines and double ones (current day single and earlier double).<br><br>Or do people think this kind of analysis is an unnecessary distraction?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence.  It's interesting, although not necessary, to track the number of items added against the number where action has been taken (either actioned in full or in part, deleted or dismissed).  I use a small notebook (squared paper instead of lined)  and have two narrow columns on the left and a narrow column on the right.  It has 34 usable lines (I use the top 2 lines for writing the page number).  I only use the right-hand page for the AF list.<br><br>Column 1 is today's date (3 squares wide)<br>Column 2 is for tracking action (1 square wide)<br>Column 3 is for writing the task (about 20 squares wide)<br>Column 4 is for noting the date that action was taken (2 squares wide)<br><br>When I start an item I make a dot in column 2 and when I'm finished with that item I cross it out, colour in the whole square and write today's date in column 4.  This makes it very easy to pick out items that are still open for action, which are white gaps among coloured squares of completed items.<br><br>In previous threads there's been discussion about the various flags and tags people add to their lists, but many people found that these tags made the lists hard to read, and found that they hampered the 'standing out' process, making it less intuitive and more like a prioritised list.  I don't find that with my system, and in AF1 I only had three columns.  Instead of marking the date of action in column 4, I used the left-hand page to put today's date, and put a mark against it each time I processed an item.  This method was also very good for doing the weekly statistics (in fact I may go back to that, as I can't remember why I decided to do an extra column instead!).  <br><br>The only statistic I keep track of is what percentage of my whole list has been processed, and what remains outstanding.  Each week I add the number of new items entered that week to the previous total; add the number of items processed that week to the previous total, then work out the percentage.  No doubt some people keep very detailed statistics, especially if they use an electronic version of AF which makes it easy to crunch the numbers, but for me it's just an interesting sideline.  Good luck with whatever method you try.<br><br>Incidentally, for AF2 I'm using the same notebook as I did for AF1, although I made a fresh start (albeit with "add an item from AF1" as an almost daily task).  The notebook is from Paperchase and measures 4 x 6 inches, and is about an inch thick.</div>

<div class="content">Another point, Laurence: statistics on AF can be misleading.  You could have a day where you did 20 items, which sounds great, but they may have been very easy, pleasurable items (I've been guilty of this myself).   On another day, you may only have done 5 items, but one (or all) of them might have been something very important to you that made you feel you'd made great progress.   Sometimes I've found myself getting too caught up in the game of picking easy tasks and procrastinating on other tasks that would have given me much more peace of mind.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Margaret, for taking the time to give your thoughts on this.<br><br>I'm partly taking a leaf from your book, after reading your methods. New tasks I will enter unmarked at the end of the list (except for the first item every day, which I will mark with the date). When I select a task for action, I will draw a small open circle to the left. (This will make it easier to spot - for me - than a single dot.) When it is complete, I will draw a line from the circle to the right through the task. The next morning, I will count the number of items added the previous day, and compare with the items done - i.e. with the open circles, and I will fill those circles in.<br><br>To facilitate seeing candidates for action, I will join the circles - open or filled in - of any adjacent done items.<br><br>Re your other comment, you are quite right, and AF1 and AF2 seem to give a license to get sidetracked doing fun things. I'm not sure how I feel about that.</div>
