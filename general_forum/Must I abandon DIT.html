<div class="content">I only ask because this is ALL new to me.  I only discovered Mark's website five days ago, read about "Will Do" lists and "Closed lists" and worked with them and found them very useful. I also ordered the book "Do it tomorrow" which is hard to get here in the U.S. and is on its way from some shipper somewhere and should arrive in about a week. I guess my question is,  are there things in the "DIT" book that will be useful to me and that can be carried over into this new system?  Also, if "DIT" so far is working for me (and again, I've only been doing this for a few days), should I continue with it?<br>I'm just curious to know what other people's thoughts are. Obviously there is much value to both of these systems.</div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>Of course DIT still works just as well as it always did so you won't lose anything by sticking with it. But personally I think Autofocus is an improvement on it - which is why I developed it.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks. I really don't want to sound like I'm being negative - in fact it's just the opposite -- I feel like I'm trying to choose between two very GOOD systems.</div>

<div class="content">Steve, all of mark's books are excellent and DIT was far and away the best system I had found prior to AF.  (You will see the difference between the two when you get your copy of the book).  <br><br>For me AF is so much more flexible and does away with feelings of guilt if you don't finish you day's tasks under DIT.  Whilst I have a similar volume of "stuff" coming in each day, other unalterable commitments meant that I only had two full days each week where I could action things, plus a few snatched hours.  The result was that on most days I could not complete my list and became discouraged.  That was not a fault of the system but a problem with my time structure - AF eliminates that difficulty for me.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me,  Christine. I'm looking forward to working with the DIT book when it arrives but also to exploring Autofocus over the next few weeks. Best of luck to you.</div>
