<div class="content">My google-fu is failing me. And my google-fu is tops.<br><br>Is there a term for a book where two people correspond with each other by writing in it, pasting / taping photos, sketching, etc? A kinda scrapbook containing letters, journals entries and what have you.<br><br>This book could be shared with someone you live with or wish to remain close to abroad by mailing it back and forth?<br><br>I'm drawing a blank and google is failing me.<br><br>This is your chance to smarter than me for a moment.</div>

<div class="content">Norman<br>What about "Sharing Journal".  They use this title in Montessori.<br>And the idea is picked up in this article:<br><a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Sharing-Journals&id=47861" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Sharing-Journals&id=47861</a></div>

<div class="content">Thanks. I wonder what else it might be called. I not just interested in creating one, but also seeing how they might have been used before our era of blogging.<br><br>I've read a lot of letters in my time. Curious if there are any famous exchanges in this "genre". <br><br>Thanks again for tip.</div>

<div class="content">Norman:<br><br>I think they were called "friendship albums".</div>

<div class="content">Thanks. That brings up some hits as well. Both terms are primarily associated with children's craft projects it seems. <br><br>My initial guess was something like "common book." But that didn't go anywhere.<br><br>Thanks again. And if anyone knows of any research into this method of journaling and communication, I would appreciate it.</div>

<div class="content">Keep em coming. I thought this kinda craft might not have ever settled into a specific name.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">My guess building on "sharing journal", "friendship albums" & "common book" is "collaborative book". Not sure the google hits are better than the earlier terms. Seems "book collaboration" gives a bit more hits ...</div>

<div class="content">Another aspect of older methods of correspondence I have been toying with is what my folks called "criss-cross writing."<br><br>Googling that brings up just a couple relevant hits about Ulysses S.Grant's letters written during the Mexican-American war.<br><br>In order to save paper, letter exchanged were simple turned ninety degree and new text written over the old.<br><br>Have you all heard of this before and what do you call it?</div>

<div class="content">This is one of the more beautiful images which turned up under "cross writing":<br><br><a href="http://www2.kenyon.edu/khistory/chase/exhibit/earlyknoxcounty/slide24.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www2.kenyon.edu/khistory/chase/exhibit/earlyknoxcounty/slide24.htm</a></div>

<div class="content">I think Google's answer to this type of correspondence is 'Google Wave' since that was created with the idea of 'what would email look like if it was invented today'. <br><br>It's interesting no service seems (I know of) seems to capture the feel of this kind of correspondence. Not facebook or email. Not a bad idea for a startup though. I suppose one could share a onenote or evernote page and do it like that.</div>

<div class="content">I've been subscribed to Google Wave since it first came out, and still have no idea what I'm supposed to do with it.</div>

<div class="content">yeah, I am definitely not looking for an electronic version. The point of my interest is that the correspondence would show age as it matures and that it is em*bodied* by those contributing to it by the particularity of their handwriting, etc.<br><br>Google Wave is an oddball.<br><br>The closest thing electronically would probably be something like a shared private blog. But again the speed of communication and the uniformity and ease of reading is something I am trying to avoid.</div>

<div class="content">I had the best luck with "collaborative book" exchange OR swap<br><br>You might be interested in these blogs about collaborative book exhange projects between two artists:<br><a href="http://lauratwotina.com/?page_id=509" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lauratwotina.com/?page_id=509</a><br><br><a href="http://aviewbeyondwords.blogspot.com/2009_01_01_archive.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://aviewbeyondwords.blogspot.com/2009_01_01_archive.html</a><br><br>Or this one that just started about a larger group book exchange:<br><a href="http://jenmccleary.com/tag/handmade-philly-book-exchange/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://jenmccleary.com/tag/handmade-philly-book-exchange/</a><br><br>"altered book" and "altered book swap" also brought up some possibilities<br><br>Looks like fun....not that I need any new crafts at the moment....</div>

<div class="content">I haven't touched Google Wave much since signing up either. There's not a big enough reason to try it out. It reminded me of the shared correspondence because it lets you work a little more creatively, you can draw, drag and drop pictures and work on a document non-linearly with multiple people. With the playback feature you can see who added what and when. Obviously doesn't come close to capturing the feel of sharing a physical object in which your write etc.</div>

<div class="content">Norman, I used something called a "Circle Journal" for a while with my Australian friend. I should send that off again.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks. Strange that this practice has so many names. I am going to see if I can find any of them in wikipedia or what wikipedia calls such a practice. You would think there would be some normative way of referring to such a widely if not frequently used practice.</div>
