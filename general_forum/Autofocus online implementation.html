<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>I've been a big fan of autofocus after spending a couple of years doing too many GTD weekly reviews. I've worked my way from AF1 to AF4 and was disappointed that there were no online autofocus implementations.<br><br>So I built one and now I work off it.<br><br><a href="http://www.autofocusapp.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.autofocusapp.com</a> - have a shot, let me know your feedback. I have AF1 and AF4 workflows in there, so when you create a notebook just pick which one you'd like to work with.<br><br>Let me know your feature requests and I'll add them as I go, I aim to get quick updates out there for features (weekly updates if family time and work permits).</div>
