<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Mark, <br><br><<((<a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10317092" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10317092</a> ) There are a couple of differences between the way that you are doing it and the way that I envisaged: <br><br>1) You are making a special mark for re-entered tasks, whereas I envisaged a special mark for new tasks.<br><br>There's a difference here in the way the marks are being used. I try to make the marks as inconspicuous as possible because they are only used to distinguish the date the task goes "over the waterfall". You are using the marks additionally to make unfinished projects stand out.>><br><br>Oops.<br><br>Well, personally I do not like having list items in my list without a symbol signifying its start, because sometimes I put on items that are a bit long and will occupy more than one line.  The "standing out" is an unintended result from using another symbol.<br><br><<2) You are marking only unfinished tasks as "re-entered", whereas I envisaged "re-entered" as including recurring tasks.>><br><br>When I was using DWM for the first time around a year ago, your explanation is how I understood what "re-entered" means.  However, it never felt right for me.  When somebody suggested in the forums to re-enter only unfinished items in the W day while re-entering recurrent but finished tasks in the M day, I tried it, and it was much smoother and logical for me...which led me to the (obviously erroneous) conclusion that THAT was how you originally envisioned it!<br><br>Sorry about that.<br><br>But anyways, I'll again stick to this for now.  It feels so...right for me.<br><br><<Personally I think I would prefer the way I envisaged, but I'll be interested to see how it works out for you. >><br><br>I fully intended to report my experiences here, don't worry ^___^<br><br><<On the subject of dating the days, all that is necessary is ...><br><br>Oh, that's cool! I never thought of that.  However, I am going to stick to my scheme for now and experience the result.  A bit of experimentation showed me that this scheme will actually visually distinguish the first 7days from the rest of the 30 days.  I just want to see if it will be beneficial to my use of the DWM.  <br><br>Let me show you guys what I mean.  Let us assume that we started from a previously existing list (like I did with mine, I started from my old AF4 list).  Here are the scans of the hypothetical first page.  Please note that, changing my initial way of marking the vital days, I make a thin highlighter line to for the 1st day, a thick highlighter line to close the 7th day from the first, and write "DISMISSED" with the highlighter to close the 30th day from the first:<br><br>1st day: <a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/1st.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/1st.jpg</a><br><br>5th day: <a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/5th.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/5th.jpg</a><br><br>8th day: <a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/8th.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/8th.jpg</a><br><br>10th day: <a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/10th.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/10th.jpg</a><br><br>17th day: <a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/17th.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/17th.jpg</a><br><br>31st day: <a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/31st.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/31st.jpg</a><br><br>32nd day: <a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/32nd.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/32nd.jpg</a><br><br>By the 31st or 32nd day one can already disregard the numbering of days and even erase them if you can (like I did with my Pilot Frixion highlighter which I bought probably from OfficeMax).<br><br>-----<br><br>JD (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10317808" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10317808</a> ),<br><br>I really am excited with this new DWM, and it's kinda embarrassing that it shows, but *shrug*.<br><br>Keep us posted with your experiences, JD!<br><br>-----<br><br>Cricket,<br><br><<<a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10323303" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10323303</a><br><br>This is getting complex.<br><br>- Will end if I do little and often (or do a ton and burn out).<br>- Will never end but should work at little and often anyways (music practice).<br>- Will end for now, but show up again (water plants, check next month for gift buying, book annual doctor visit).<br>- One time (get quotes for new roof).<br>- Re-entred after 30 days. On short notice.>><br><br>That actually gave me a bit of pause.  Let me think about that more, although I'll be really interested with your exprience.<br><br><<I consider this a brainstorm stage. It's supposed to be complex as we explore options. Then each of us will pick the options that work best for us and simplify it. >><br><br>I agree! ^___^<br><br>-----<br><br>Mark,<br><br><<(<a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10323440" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10323440</a> ) The rationale behind my method is that you can put anything you like on the list and you have 30 days to activate it. Once it's been activated you have to keep it going by taking action on it at least once every 7 days. So the system gives you time to consider whether to allow something into your life, and gets rid of it fairly quickly if it doesn't work out.>><br><br>Actually that is how I also envisioned my version of this system.  However, I want to try the paradigm that it is not /doing/ that's important but /finishing/.  If I do activate an action within those 30 days, it is imperative that I either finish it or chuck it away.<br><br><<In summary, I'm concentrating on keeping the list pruned, while numtym is concentrating more on getting larger jobs finished. The methods of course overlap each other to some extent.>><br><br>Ahh. Well, in my current paradigm, pruning the list is one of the goals, but the main goal is to let the system choose for me what're important, do and FINISH those, then dismiss the rest while not neglecting my routine maintenance tasks.  And finishing means even the small tasks!<br><br>Of course, that would mean that my list COULD become monstrous, but let's see.<br><br><<All we need to do now is to find a way of achieving both without complicating things too much. >><br><br>I do hope so, Mark. No one likes monstrous backlogs.<br><br>----<br><br>God bless us all</div>

<div class="content">Wow, somebody's excited :-)<br><br>I'm not DWMing, but this discussion on DWM2 (and the discussion on AF1) excites me too.  Good ideas breed more (sometimes good) ideas.<br><br>So now I'm retweaking my hyper-tweaked AF4 to incorporate these concepts:  Daily work, frequent dismissal, integrating yet distinguishing new and active tasks, focus on finishing, and the up/down/sideways system.  And attempting to maintain the simple aesthetics of AF4.  To be honest I don't think it can be called AF4 anymore, but it's really feeling good.  <br><br>Thanks for the inspiration :-)  I'll share mine next week if this works as well as I expect.</div>

<div class="content">Why not "not re-enter recurring tasks"?<br>They are finished and if they are important for you, you will put them in your list when you feel the need to start moving on them. And if they where just things that where taking of your time by habit but where not that important to you, then you can maybe shake them off!</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Hi Erik,<br><br><<Why not "not re-enter recurring tasks"?>><br><br>You are probably confused by the terms I and Mark were using, Erik.  In the DWM time management system, two types of tasks are entered: the [new tasks] and the [re-entered tasks].  Here is the original blog post that first revealed DWM which explains it:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html</a><br><br>Now, I was saying that a recurring task that was just finished must be written back into the DWM list because, as a recurring task, you will do it again in the near future and you need to be reminded of it, but written not as a "re-entered task" but rather as a "new task" because you already finished it today.<br><br>Kinda confusing, ain't it?<br><br>-----<br><br>Hi Alan,<br><br><<There are many things that need doing once a week or less often Writing those a week out is futile because there's often nothing to do in the next several days. Write it at one month, and a week or two from now you will tackle it. >><br><br>Yes, that is one reason recurring tasks should not be written back as "re-entered tasks" but rather as "new tasks."<br><br><<Daily habits however should be reentered at the week mark.>><br><br>Now here is a funny thing about this new way of doing DWM that I just noticed now.  In the original version of DWM, re-entered items are written several pages away from where the new items are written; there are two entry points.  <br><br>In this new way of DWM, however, there is only one entry point,  but with special symbol/s distinguishing the "re-entered tasks" from the "new tasks" to facilitate the dismissing of unactioned "re-entered tasks" 7 days into the future. Now because of this, "re-entered tasks" due to be deleted 7 days after they were written intermingle with "new tasks" that are due to be deleted 30 days after! This creates task-choosing dynamics that are totally different from those in the original DWM.  And Alan, the dynamics that are relevant to what you said comes from the fact that daily recurrent tasks are right beside the "re-entered tasks" even if these recurrent tasks are entered as "new tasks".  <br><br>What's the significance? The thing is, when I am processing my DWM, the daily recurrent tasks "stand out" naturally, even though they are not especially marked as "re-entered tasks,"  because I KNOW they should be done sometime today the moment I read them.  There is no need to mark them as "re-entered" except when I have to leave a recurrent task hanging unfinished.  If this was in an original DWM scheme and those daily recurrent tasks were written in the 30th day page I most probably would have missed them.  But in the new way of DWM, there is no danger.<br><br>-----<br><br>Hey Mark, do you think this new way of doing DWM warrants to be called "DWM2"? There are significant differences between this and the original, but the forms are more or less still the same.  Maybe Revised DWM (RDWM) or DWM Revised (DWMR) or DWM1.5? Any suggestions?<br><br>-----<br><br>God bless us all</div>

It allows a degree of flexibility while still forcing you to keep hammering away at the tasks.

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I had been thinking of Cricket's "complicated" question,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10323303" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10323303</a><br><br>and Alan's note that daily recurrent tasks should be rewritten as "re-entered" tasks upon completion.  The only thing that I could think of to answer both would be to distinguish two types of "re-entered tasks": Re-Entered Tasks that should be done ASAP, and Re-Entered Tasks that should (probably could only) be done tomorrow.  This could be done again using marks on the beginning of each item, and trying to make them as intuitive as possible I thought of this:<br><br><a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/marks.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/marks.jpg</a><br><br>So the following would be the procedure for this:<br><br>1) Choose a task and work on it.<br>2) If you have to leave it unfinished for now but intend to finish it today, cross-out the item and re-write on the end of the list as a "Re-Entered ASAP Task."<br>3) If either you have to leave it unfinished but determined you will resume it tomorrow or in a few days, or you just finished a daily recurrent task, cross it out and re-write on the end of the list as a "Re-Entered For Tomorrow Task."  This should signal you to skip the item over when you process your DWM again today.<br>4) On the morning of the next day (or on the evening of the current day), after drawing the line denoting the start of a new day for DWM, look through your list for "Re-Entered For Tomorrow Task" items, decide which items you will work on today (or tomorrow), then shade them in to mark them as "Re-Entered ASAP Task" items.<br>5) Both "Re-Entered ASAP Tasks" and "Re-Entered For Tomorrow Tasks" that are still not acted upon by the 7th day are to be dismissed.<br><br>Now, after thinking about this, a thought hit me: >>did I just add DIT principles into the mix?<< O.O<br><br>I'm going to try this today.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">I remember being laughed out of town when I mentioned the 'not insane' to do list maybe a year ago!<br><br> This list basically works in the same way as Mark has described above, i.e. 3 tasks are chosen, worked on, and re-entered if not finished. <br><br>What seems to work for me for the most part is running 30 minute time boxes ( useful for both concentration & tracking) on each item: <br><br>1 = Inbox to zero<br>2 = Reviewable items (tracked as tickler items in my diary / calendar)<br>3 = Selected project ( an Organizational Project)<br><br>I choose my Organizational Project based on a CARVER Matrix. 1 & 2 work very well but number 3 is difficult as the slot can be occupied upto several weeks until done. Maybe number 3 would be better as a Current Initiative?</div>

<div class="content">Continuing on a tangent of Leon's post and the 3 items thingy...<br><br>Three is really a magic number, don't ask me why but from experience, it just works.<br><br>From my Kanban perspective, I realized that most "Projects" I start, I tend to focus on them until done. That means that if I have more then one project that I want to do, most of the time, they wait in the backlog until I finish the current one. It looks like the current initiative to me when seen under that light.<br><br>Now it doesn't mean that other projects don't move forward, they just move more slowly until I finish with my main project and have time to focus on them. I also noticed that if there are more then 3 projects, things start to slow down too much for me because I need momentum to follow through my projects.<br><br>So, I can have any amount of "Maintenance" on my backlog and it won't hinder me at all; I know where to stop and what's most urgent. But I rarely have more then 3 project stickers in my backlog and today area (totaled together). Maybe it has to do with the fact that you have to be creative which demands a high degree of concentration (you loose that effect if you dilute it within many projects) and also with the fact that: the way to do it and the outcome of what you do on maintenance things is already known while you have to figure the former and guess the latter for project things...<br><br>So I like the idea of 3 items but only for Projects...</div>

<div class="content">Mark: <br><br>Thanks for the advice. I have the book & will review it. <br><br>As for my number 3 slot...do you have any thoughts as to this being used for an 'organisational project' or a 'current initiative' or something else?<br><br>I'm wondering whether to set number 3 to a set number of timeboxes (I like 30 for some reason) in the true timeboxing tradition. So the scope of the project can be changed but the amount of time spent on it cannot, e.g. 30 x 30min timeboxes in my example. This might work well specifically for those 'one off' organisational projects...</div>

<div class="content">leon:<br><br>My thinking in the simple system I described was that one could chose whatever tasks one liked to go in all three slots. Further to that I think it's important with large projects to be clear what you mean by "finishing". For instance, if you are reading a book have you only finished when you've read the entire book, or are you taking it chapter by chapter? Only you can define this, and it's important that you are clear about it when you start the task.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark: <br><br>The simple system you describe is almost the same as 'the not insane to do list' - not sure if you have seen it?<br><br>How would you deal with incoming work to your inboxes and reviewable items (otherwise known as 'waiting for' or 'tickler')? <br><br>For example, so far I can see that on average I need 4 x 30 minute timeboxes daily emptying my inboxes to zero. My definition of inbox to zero is more based on your DIT principles rather than Allen's GTD 2 minute rule in that I bring the work *upto date* before moving it on for review if appropriate. <br><br>Not that there's anything wrong with the simple system described or indeed the 'not insane to do list' but obviously neither seems like a *complete* system like autofocus or GTD for example.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Leon,<br><br>I envisioned the "three item microfocus" to be a supplement to any time management system one has.  You either just take three items from your AF/GTD/Whatever and just focus on those then replenish when finished, or add "Microfocus" as an item in the time management system.<br><br>I think Mark's system is of the same approach.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">I hear you Leon. I have a solution to your quest and I'm working to write up my solution soon.  It's a complete system and integrates microfocusing.</div>

<div class="content">I am using the triple task method now, and its amazing what I can squeeze in between the huge and hairy project I am doing now on the available 2 slots. One slot is reserved exclusively for that mother task. My world hasn't fallen apart (yet!), and in fact I feeI very focused while comforted with the knowledge that the pilot fish are being fed as I manage the big whale.<br><br>It will be interesting to hear what others think about whether this method could be part of a larger system, but somehow my instincts tell me otherwise. Focus and completion are the objects of this method, constant picking off a main task list will detract from the focus you achieve here.</div>

<div class="content">JD:<br><br>I think I agree with you. I've been using it for the past few days and succeeded in getting one project completed which has been hanging over me for a long time. The other two slots have been filled with things which I also really have needed to get done. My feeling is that if I had been picking items off a bigger list, I would never have got so much important stuff done. As it is I really have to think about what would be the two most appropriate "new" tasks for the available slots.</div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br><< How would you deal with incoming work to your inboxes and reviewable items (otherwise known as 'waiting for' or 'tickler')?  >><br><br>I've been dealing with tasks like this by grouping them under fairly wide headings. For example, in AF and DWM I would be writing this comment under the task "Comments". But under the 3-Task system I am writing it under a wider task heading called "Communications" which also includes Email, Paper, Voicemail, Facebook, etc. It's actually closer to what I recommended in my first book "Get Everything Done".</div>

<div class="content">Yet by limiting yourself to three tasks you lose the completeness of Autofocus. I assume you limit your time and then get back to your other system when the time is up.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark & all - yes, I really think grouping works wonders on a triple task method. I ran into problems on a task I wrote as "Call X". I realised I had better deal with other calls while I am at it, so that I can go back to my project and not have to worry about calls for the rest of the day. <br><br>Following the rules, I couldn't make any further calls as there were no further available slots, and the big hairy project was next it line, and it would suck me into a black-hole where no other tasks can survive! It was a mildly stressful situation that brought home the point.<br><br>Just a task labelled "Calls" with names of persons I wanted to contact next to it would've done the trick.</div>

<div class="content">my approach has been along the lines of set categories really, using 30 minute time boxes for each. slot 1 is for 'set up' activities (one at a time), slot 2 for 'incoming work' to my inboxes. slot 3 is for 'reviewable items'. <br><br>I have the same approach for work and home bisected with a vertical line. everything gets written into my moleskine notebook. <br><br>this seems to be dealing well with floating tasks, so i can use my calendar for meetings, recreational activities etc. <br><br>I don't believe there is a perfect system out there. realistically a system that meets 80% of my needs is surely good enough. well, here's hoping!!<br><br>I do also like the idea of choosing different tasks as described above, so let's here more about how things develop everyone!</div>

<div class="content">How about reviewing the big list when you repopulate the 3-item list?<br><br>Insisting that the three items on the list fit in different categories is similar to what I used to do -- spend time each day in each category. It didn't work. If I stalled on one category, I stalled for the entire day. (Now I realize time-boxing might have helped -- even if I've done nothing, time's up, move on.) The last category of the day almost always got skipped. If I felt like doing something in a different category, I stalled. Changing the order led to more time thinking about my tasks than doing them (and the associated guilt of not getting them done).<br><br>On the other hand, keeping three different types of tasks on the short list keeps my options open and leads to a more balanced life. Maybe I'll try Active, Office and Study.<br><br>The new DWM works well in keeping my current and backlog separate, and both progressing. I now enjoy working my big list. I used to subdivide tasks and only mark each sub-task off when totally done. I'd ignore the big list because the first page was filled with things I knew I wouldn't make progress on. Now I work a bit on the big project, cross it off, re-enter it on the next line of the list, and pick something else.<br><br>Under the original DWM, I was tempted to schedule things, even though that isn't how it was supposed to be used. Then I'd fall behind.<br><br>I do keep a calendar for repetitive tasks. As I finish a task, I write it on the day I next want to do it, but with no pressure. This works well for weekly and less often. Each day I consider the tasks on the calendar to be added to the list. (I don't bother to recopy them.) Knowing that big projects are on the big list, I can resist the temptation to schedule them on the calendar.<br><br>I need to get a copy of DIT and reread the DWM descriptions.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I'm writing up the system even now.  There's only 7 rules, same # as AF4, but there are major differences and it will take time to explain.  I'm very happy with it, and combined with my project organizing system, it does _everything_ I'm looking for.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks! I've reread the DWM posts now. I like how you're experimenting with different ways of organizing the same concepts. Each one highlights different things to consider.<br><br>Would the DIT book (and system) be suitable for my 12yo? He just finished Hunt for Red October for fun, and last week earned rather spectacular proof that his teachers and parents were right -- keeping it all in your head and leaving things till the last minute only works in the early grades. (It was a fun weekend keeping him on track for 2 late projects which were supposed to take a month. Ah, well, better his system be tested to destruction and improved now than when there are real-life consequences.)</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Leon,<br><br>After examining and ruminating on Mark's further explanations on his triple-task system I realized that my envisioned system and his are completely different.  Sorry about that.<br><br>-----<br><br>Alan,<br><br><<Yet by limiting yourself to three tasks you lose the completeness of Autofocus.>><br><br>I do not think so, Alan.  The solution to making it as "complete" as Autofocus, I think, is to  treat ALL tasks as part of some project.  And if I understood your statement (<<combined with my project organizing system, it does _everything_ I'm looking for >>) I am guessing that's what you are trying to do ^__^.  I'm also very interested in seeing your system.  <br><br>----<br><br>Anyways, a report on my use of the new DWM.  I am now reaching the 7th day mark, and I have to admit, Alan's right: once the DWM nears one week, it becomes harder to distinguish new tasks from daily habits/recurrent tasks because of the increased volume of tasks, therefore a mark to distinguish them must be thought of.  And frankly, I hate the system that I devised (<a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/marks.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/DWM/marks.jpg</a> ), but I still want to retain the advantage that I had with distinguishing unfinished tasks.  Therefore here is the new system that I am trying (sorry no scanner again, I hope this will do): <br><br>> New Item<br>∙ Finished recurrent item<br>● Unfinished item<br><br>I am still deciding whether only unfinished items will be treated as "Re-entered" items (that is, will be dismissed at the 7th day) or to also include the finished recurrent items.  Let us see what will happen.<br><br>----<br><br>God bless.</div>
