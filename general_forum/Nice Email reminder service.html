<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I was using IWantSandy.com some years ago and really liked it but "Sandy resigned" and since then I was searching for some simple Email reminder service.<br><br>I test <a href="http://www.virtual.nu/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.virtual.nu/</a> now I looks it works for me and is a good add on to my Autofocus setup ( Moleskine + pen :) )<br><br>I use virtual.nu for:<br><br>a- When I ask a question to someone by email I BCC virtual.nu for a reminder 2 or 5 days from today. If I didn't get an answer I can remind the person when the remind email arrive.<br>b- I get a E-ticket for a trip 2 month from now. Then I forward the email to virtual.nu for a reminder 56 days from now and I get a copy of my E-ticket just some day before my trip.<br><br>I hope you follow how I use it. I know you can use it as a Todo / reminder but I do not use it as a todo reminder.<br><br>Someone here using virtual.nu or some email reminder service that can share how you use it ?<br><br><br>Note : Virtual.nu is a free service</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Is it possible to use this service as a "virtual" AF notebook ?<br>What I mean I use a pen and paper today.<br><br>Let say I send Email to the service I will get the email back as reminder after the time I decide.<br>Then I have task to work on.<br>I resend the email if I want to work on it later.<br><br>If I have a task I want to work on with my AF system but which is 1 month away I schedule it for a reminder 20 days away.<br><br>Get my Idea ?</div>

<div class="content">Followup.cc is another one very similar to virtual.nu. I am testing that now and find that it is much easier sending an email to yourself as a reminder than to use the calendar part of your software to do so.<br><br>Thanks Steve for your original suggestion. I think I am going to find it very useful.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I have test folowup.cc but I prefere virtual.nu for 2 reasons:<br>1-No need to register so you can send from any email adress.<br>2- Google Talk reminder part make it very useful with an android or Iphone smartphone.<br><br>I like sending reminder via email. <br>Use it more day by day.</div>
