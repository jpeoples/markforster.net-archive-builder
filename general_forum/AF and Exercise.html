<div class="content">Hello, can anyone tell me how they're coming with using AF and daily exercise, or maybe not so daily exercise?  It seems like as AF is used, you add these types of activities to the list as well.  Thanks, TK</div>

<div class="content">I do put exercise in AF but it never "stands out" for me and if it does I try to ignore it ;-)  So, I schedule exercise mostly otherwise it would never happen.<br><br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">I haven't had much success letting Exercise be done whenever it pops up on my list.  I am much more successful by scheduling this on my calendar at a specific time.</div>

<div class="content">I was reviewing my AF notebook which I started on the 15th of June and one area in which I have had the greatest success was in scheduling regular time for exercises every day. I can tell you that I have just missed two days of exercises - thanks to AF.</div>
