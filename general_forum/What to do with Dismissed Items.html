<div class="content">After an item is dismissed by highlighting and moving on, what are you supposed to do? I assume you review dismissed items periodically, but nothing I've seen explicitly says to do that.</div>

<div class="content">The first time I dismissed an item in AF I added a task to the end of the list of 'review dismissed items' then when this stands out I will review anything that's been dismissed to date.<br><br>So far on reviewing dismissed items I have permanently removed from the AF list as a subsequent set of actions has superseded it, another item has been re-added to the list as it's now appropriate to do this actionThe remaining dismissed items are still being removed as the review task stands out for me.<br><br>Hope this makes sense and helps</div>
