<div class="content">I was just reading <a href="http://zenhabits.net/discipline-is-illusion-motivate/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/discipline-is-illusion-motivate/</a> which is saying that discipline is an illusion and that motivation is the most important factor, does anyone disagree with this?</div>

<div class="content">I agree at 95%<br><br>What I mean is that if you want to do anything in life, motivation is always the key.<br>It helps you study, work harder if need be, being involved in what you do and helps you keep at something for a long time.<br><br>Where the rubber hits the road though, if you don't cultivate discipline, you are someone that cannot be counted on (I know too many people like that). Also to give you an example, I was generally bright in class, my brother a little less. I was motivated by the classes and never studied for tests (with mixed results) but I usually managed to pass. My brother always studied hard with the same results. In the end, he was the better of us both because he can keep at something even if it's hard or there is a chance of failure, I can't...<br><br>Also, motivation comes in degrees. There's the shiny new thing then you get a down, that's where discipline comes in until you find the deeper motivation.<br><br>- Always Keep it in Perspective -</div>

<div class="content">Discipline - do what you want done<br>Motivate - increase desire to do<br><br>there's a difference between what you want to do and what you want to be done. Focusing on discipline is focusing on a general skill. Focusing on motivation is focusing on a specific issue. So if you are more disciplined you need less motivation for everything. On the other hand, more motivation makes discipline easy. <br><br>Bottom line: discipline seems better, but failing that motivation is the way forward.</div>

<div class="content">Even simpler: Discipline makes you stronger. Motivation makes work easier.</div>
