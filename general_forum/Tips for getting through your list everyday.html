<div class="content">I realize Mark has written a whole chapter on this subject but I'm always looking for more ways to improve upon this. I believe DIT is the best system around and I can't imagine working any other way now. I've had an unusually high work load over the past couple of months and it can really burn a person out. Any tips out there? What's working for you?<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Here's what's working for me. <br><br>I carry an A5 notebook with me everywhere.  I have done for a long time, long before I encountered Mark F.  Now, following the DIT idea, I make the pages at the back of the book my Will Do lists.  Compared with Marks's suggestion of having a separate diary, this has the advantage that I don't have to carry around two items, a notebook and a diary.  It has the disadvantage that a notebook only lasts me three weeks or so, and so I can't easily log something to do on a date far into the future.  (I have a page in the note book labelled "to future notebooks" to handle this.)<br><br>When I start a new notebook, I label the pages at the back of the book with the dates for the coming few days.  I fold each page in half, then unfold it.  That puts a vertical crease down the page, dividing the page into left and right halves.  (Drawing a vertical line would do just as well, except it looks ragged when I do it.)  Down the left side I put work things.  Down the right I put non-work things.  This ensures that the non-work things don't get neglected due to pressing work commitments.<br><br>I draw a line horizontal line near the top of the page.  Above it, I put my current initiatives for that day, one for work, one for non-work.<br><br>I draw a second horizontal line about three quarters of the way down the page.  In the space in the middle of the page, between my two lines, I write my work and non-work to do lists.  In keeping with the DIT philosophy, I  put items that come up today on tomorrow's page.<br><br>At the bottom of the page, below the second line, I write items that I encounter during the day that really do have to be done today.  DIT discourages these, but they do happen and I need somewhere to write them.  I rarely have more than one or two of them.<br><br>If over several days I find that I am repeatedly failing to get everything on the list done,  the fix is simple.  On the pages representing the coming days, I draw the lower line higher up the page, so there is less space in which to write the will do list.  That way I can't take on too many things.  Once I get back to reliably completing the things on the page, I can lower the line, increasing the amount of the space in the middle of the page available for will do items.  <br><br>I think the key insight of GTD is that getting to the point where one can dependably do the things that one says one will is a major milestone in personal effectiveness.</div>

<div class="content">Excellent post, David. But please note that I don't discourage you from doing things the same day that really need doing the same day. I just encourage you to make sure that they really *do* need doing the same day!</div>
