<div class="content">Just wondered if anyone had tried the ratchet version of Mark's diet, whether they had any success, and whether they used the same rules as he did.</div>

<div class="content">I gave it a go.  You can read about my initial experience <a href="http://www.darktea.co.uk/blog/weight/ratcheting-down-my-weight/" rel="nofollow">http://www.darktea.co.uk/blog/weight/ratcheting-down-my-weight/</a><br><br>I used it for about a month before I went away for several days and I have to admit, forgot about it.<br><br>I used much smaller steps than Mark which were all aimed to introduce good habits, such as <br>* not eating chocolate, <br>* drinking before eating, <br>* smaller portions, <br>* going for a walk<br><br>It started off very positive, but after the initial few days my weight started increasing.  Although the trend was downward I still found I was having to add more and more habits.</div>

<div class="content">I use a version of this plan, but much looser. I tried creating a list of specific behaviors that I would initiate on my "heavy" days, and that would escalate in intensity based on my weigh-ins, but I could never properly remember them or track them. <br><br>So if I'm over my target weight, I just try to be mindful and make good decisions in the moment. However, I keep an assortment tactics in mind and choose whatever's most reasonable when I have to make a choice.<br><br>For example, I of course avoid the candy machines on a heavy day. If I'm still heavy, I'll opt for smaller portions (my most frequent tactic), salads, more water, fewer "white foods," a little more exercise. Perhaps I'll do an intermittent fast (stop eating about 7 pm and resume eating the next day at noon). <br><br>I may do one, two, or more of these in combination on a heavy day. Not scientific at all, but I'm interested in keeping the weight down, and these are proven strategies for me. <br><br>I also know that my weight can vary by maybe 5 pounds from day to day, based on lots of factors that may not be under my control. So I give my body a couple of days to respond to whatever I'm doing.<br><br>When I finally reach the target weight, I keep the strategies in place. When I go under the target weight, I will relax the strategies -- maybe stop the salads, maybe eat larger portions. But after investing that much time and energy in losing the weight, I'm not eager to put it all back on again!<br><br>All best,<br><br>Mike</div>
