<div class="content">How much time/money would it take to create an iPhone app, dedicated to implementing the autofocus system?</div>

<div class="content">I would guess that Apple makes it pretty difficult.  I hear complaints by developers about dealing with them.</div>

<div class="content">I would have written one by now, but Apple allows only Mac owners to write iPhone apps, for starters. I'm not gonna shell out that much money for that privilege. And even if you own a Mac, you have to pay to be a certified iPhone programmer and get Apps to the store, as far as I know. And even then you're at Apple's mercy because they can deny your app from being published just like that. Recent examples are Google Voice (unwanted competition) and the Ninjawords dictionary (censorship).<br><br>The only way for me is a web app, it seems.</div>

<div class="content">I may have a connection to iPhone web app developers. If there's enough interest, I'd contact them to inquire about pricing. <br><br>Web-based solutions don't work for me.</div>

<div class="content">We are putting together specifications for an iPhone app right now. I have emailed Marc to ask his position on third party applications. I haven't heard back yet. We are planning on having both and iPhone client and a rich web client that will sync with each other.</div>

<div class="content">It's perhaps worth mentioning that I'm using Omnifocus for the iPhone to implement AF, and it works very nicely. (I'm using it with the desktop version of Omnifocus, but I don't think you have to.) Not to say that an app dedicated to AF mightn't have some advantages, but Omnifocus certainly does the trick.</div>

<div class="content">It's not that Omnifocus doesn't work, but rather, it's overkill, and expensive, to use for AF.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum,<br><br>No disagreement there! The considerable flexibility of Omnifocus might make it economical in the long run, if you think you might change the way you do things again in the future (e.g., because Mark comes up with an even better system). But it's definitely not cheap, and there is a bit of an investment of time involved in learning to use it.<br><br>Anyway, didn't mean to take the discussion off-track.</div>
