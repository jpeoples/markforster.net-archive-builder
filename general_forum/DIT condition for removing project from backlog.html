<div class="content">In DIT, which of the following (or another option of your providing) is the correct criterion for crossing a project off a backlog?<br><br>1. When it has been entirely completed, no matter how long that takes.<br><br>2. When it is up to date, and then it can go into the Task Diary for tomorrow.<br><br>3. When some work has been done on it, and then it can go into the Task Diary for tomorrow.<br><br>For example, I am reading a book that I originally planned to be finished with months ago. Now it is on my DIT backlog. I am wondering if I should leave it on the backlog until I finish the book, or if I should read a chapter and then go ahead and enter the next chapter in the Task Diary for tomorrow, using the reasoning that the new plan is to be done with it in one week from now.<br><br>Another example: Suppose a new project comes in that will take 8 months. The first step gets added to the task diary for tomorrow, and you happen to fall a few days behind and need to declare a backlog, including that project. Do you really need to wait until you finish the entire 8-month project to remove it, or can you put it back into the Task Diary once you are back on track with it according to your original plan?<br><br>In the past, my usual method has been to move an item from the backlog into the Task Diary for tomorrow when I have done any work on it, considering it "re-activated" and in a sense back on track. However, some comments from Mark in a previous thread that Cricket started a while back ( <a href="../general_forum/If Your Closed List Grows, Was It Really Closed.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2377089</a> ) led me to wonder whether my procedure is truly in keeping with DIT principles.<br><br>What is the correct DIT approach?</div>

<div class="content">Austin:<br><br>The correct answer is 2. You need to get back up to date with the project.<br><br>In the case of the first example, the book, as it's purely a private project you can amend your planned finish date as you wish, so all you would have to do is read your new target for the day. Then you can put the book back in the task diary.<br><br>In the second example, the project, since the completion date is a long way off you will probably be able to do the same. However with a close completion date where it's not possible to adjust the plan, you will need to catch up before you can put the project back in the task diary.<br><br>The above is just a guideline. In reality, do whatever you think will work best in the circumstances. Remember one's time management system is intended to help you get the work done, not get in the way of the work!</div>

<div class="content">That makes a lot of sense. Thank you, Mark.</div>
