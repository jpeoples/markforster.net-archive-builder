<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-02-9 20:32</div>
<div class="content">I may be proved wrong, but SF3 feels closer to the culmination of the AF experiment, rather than yet another enticing variant (although of course, I wouldn’t put anything past Mark). Whether or not this proves to be true, SF3 has certainly generated more excitement and activity than I can recall on this site for quite some time. <br><br>I thought it might be helpful to Mark (and to one another) if we started a post which could be used as a baseline to measure people’s changing experience of SF3 over time. As Mark has indicated in a recent post, one week is much too early to accurately judge the effectiveness of a new time management system. However, it might be useful to measure people’s initial responses against their experience of SF3 a little further down the line.<br><br>So I propose that people add their responses to this post in the very simple layout below:<br><br>1. What system are you currently using and what had you been using previously?<br><br>2. How long have you been using your current system?<br><br>3. In less than 10 words, what do you most like about it?<br><br>4. In less than 10 words, what are you struggling with/concerned about?<br><br>5. Do you use your chosen system at home and at work (I recognise that for some of you, your ‘work’ may be at home)?<br><br>6. How would you best describe your (primary) work in terms of the nature of tasks (eg. mostly non-urgent project based tasks)?<br><br>7. Do you use your chosen system electronically or paper?<br><br>8. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being brilliant / MF), how would you rate your own competence in time management?<br><br>As you can see, I’ve thrown a couple of additional questions to appease my own curiosity. <br><br>If people are keen to respond to this post, then could I suggest that people stick very rigidly to the format (ie. keeping responses very short  and posting any developments in a different/new post)?<br><br>If this post gets a good response, then we can repeat it in a month’s time and perhaps again in three months’ time. The results may prove illuminating.</div>

<div class="content">1. System: SF3 (previously a personal hybrid of A4FR) <br><br>2. Length: 3 days<br><br>3. Good: Handles urgent tasks with greater ease<br><br>4. Concerns: Shortening my tasks descriptions to fit 2 columns <br><br>5. Where: Work only (soon to be home as well)<br><br>6. Tasks: 25% project based. 75% urgent/high pressure.<br><br>7. Format: Paper (A5 filofax landscape)<br><br>8. Competence: 6/10 (significant improvement thanks to Mark)</div>

<div class="content">OK I start<br><br>1. What system are you currently using and what had you been using previously?<br>Superfocus V3 - previous AF1 previous AF4 previous AF1<br><br>2. How long have you been using your current system?<br>SFV3 2 days, AF1 long time (1 year) AF4 1 year too in parallel with AF1. <br><br>3. In less than 10 words, what do you most like about it?<br>Control, easy, efficient, confident, pleasure, intuition, feeling...<br><br>4. In less than 10 words, what are you struggling with/concerned about?<br>Dismissing, new tasks, following of projects<br><br>5. Do you use your chosen system at home and at work (I recognise that for some of you, your ‘work’ may be at home)?<br>Both. I work at home. <br><br>6. How would you best describe your (primary) work in terms of the nature of tasks (eg. mostly non-urgent project based tasks)?<br>My office is a battle front. 30 calls a day. lost of tasks. My job is like a trader but in investment business real estate and it is my company. So I work on project, on tasks alway guided by the constant search of result and cash. <br><br>7. Do you use your chosen system electronically or paper?<br>I made many try electronically nothing is better for me than paper. <br>Each time I tried to go to digital I lose my intuition and my pleasure too. <br><br>8. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being brilliant / MF), how would you rate your own competence in time management ?<br> 7 by now. But I struggled a lot, and still struggling...</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>Time will tell! <br><br>I am, however, pleased to hear that this is your intention and I wish you the very best as you continue to consolidate upon SF. <br><br>And are you willing to answer the 8 posed questions? Always good to have the shepherd leading the flock.</div>

<div class="content">I feel it's more relevant to post what I was doing, than what I started yesterday.<br>1. Using: A mash-up of SFv2, AF4R over project pages.<br>2. How long: About 1 month.<br>3. Like: I can see everything at a glance.<br>4. Dislike: Get stuck in Unfinished.  Get stuck away from Unfinished.<br>5. Where: home and work<br>6. Nature: work consists of semi-urgent tasks and many large tasks.<br>7. Media: Work - OneNote   Home - Paper<br>8. Competence: 5.  But this AF stuff gets me to 9.<br><br>For what it's worth, my current impression of SFv3:<br>3. Like: Not getting stuck.  All manner of stuff getting done.<br>4. Dislike: Too slow getting through the list.  (I expect this is more a matter of catching up on things previously neglected.)</div>

<div class="content">Relocated four old pages to a backlog.  1.5 new pages left.  Hey! It's no longer slow getting through!</div>

<div class="content">1. I am using the SF3.  Had previously tried the AF (not sure which version), but lapsed some months ago with moving house 5 times in the last 4 months - I have now tracked down my old lists.<br><br>2. SF3 - 2 days, (AF - before lapse - approx 6 weeks)<br><br>3. SF3 keeps tasks closer to the current page for more attention<br><br>4. Lack of good habit with using a system<br><br>5. Home, & work-from home.  Not at 'work' for my employer as tasks there are fairly rigidly delineated.<br><br>6. Irregularly urgent tasks (month end returns) with generally non-urgent tasks otherwise.<br><br>7. Paper - the computer isn't 'flexible' or fast enough.  (the operator is not very fast at input...)<br><br>8. Probably currently around a 3-4</div>
