<div class="content">I recently bought some loose leaf rings from Ryman. They look like this (and are cheaper from this ebay seller - who has no connection to me and whom I'm never used so cannot vouch for).<br><br><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Stationery-Handy-Pack---4-Leaf-Rings---Loose-(25mm)_W0QQitemZ390011805180QQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Stationery-Handy-Pack---4-Leaf-Rings---Loose-(25mm)_W0QQitemZ390011805180QQcmdZViewItem</a><br><br>The rings hold together my AF lists, together with expenses receipts, e-calendar printout, bills, letters to be answered etc. Basically like having an A4 folder but so much lighter and easier to cope with if, like me, you carry a handbag rather than a briefcase.<br><br>I was using a bulldog clip but found my whole sheaf of papers would come apart and disordered every time I needed to insert something new.<br><br>Every piece of paper that comes in goes straight on the back of the ring - so it's a date-ordered filing system to boot! Once I'm done with a piece of paper, it's easy to remove without affecting the rest, because I can just flip over to what I need.<br><br>I have a coloured card on the 'front' with my contact details in case it's ever lost, and also to act as a marker for my AF list.<br><br>Hope it helps someone - I'm beyond thrilled with it, which gives you some indication of what an exciting life I lead ;-))</div>
