<div class="content">A quick note for the newbies and anyone interested in getting started on anything, but just can't seem to get going.<br><br>I have a current project that I've really been struggling with and now a deadline has been imposed by a third party.  Even with a deadline, I sometimes find it difficult to get under way and make progress.<br><br>So I've returned to the Salami Slice solution and it's still working for me (note to self: why don't I use it more often? Another note to self: don't get too distracted by introspection).<br><br>I set 5 minutes this morning on my kitchen timer on a shelf in my home office.  Each time it beeps, I add another five minutes and set it running again, and add five minutes every time.<br><br>So I've now done 5 + 10 + 15 . . . . + 40 + 45 minutes = 225 minutes excluding a short breakfast break.<br><br>Now to go for a walk on this lovely Spring day here in England (yes, we do have them sometimes) before returning to start again at 5 minutes, amazing how one slides into the groove and progress is made.</div>
