<div class="content">Learn from the negative as well as the positive, from the failures as well as the successes. <br>-- Jim Rohn<br><br>My husband woke up this morning with vim and enthusiasm. After our walk with the dog to the coffee shop (and a giant ice coffee), he was even more excited about all the ideas in his head. So he sat down at the computer, started a text document somewhere, and wrote "I need to figure out a way to record my ideas, so I can categorize and distribute them to other more appropriate systems."<br><br>He's a serial organizer. He's used Things and OmniFocus and most popular electronic and paper systems. I'm not knocking his system -- for him. But if I do that kind of stuff, it's serial procrastination. Meta-meta organizing instead of getting started on Anything.<br><br>I've had good luck with all of Mark's systems (thanks Mark!). As long as I focus more on doing stuff and less on organizing stuff. I've been on long-term hiatus and have done very little this summer. Now I'm diving back in, using the Final Version.<br><br>Or as Jim Rohn put it:<br>Resolve says, "I will." The man says, "I will climb this mountain. They told me it is too high, too far, too steep, too rocky, and too difficult. But it's my mountain. I will climb it and you will soon see me waving from the top or dead on the side from trying."</div>

<div class="content">I love listening to Jim Rohn.  He's all about staying focused on what you want to achieve and on how to get there by working at it.  Quoting him: <br>"There are no new fundamentals.  Truth is not new; it's old."  <br>"What's simple to do is also simple not to do."  (So take care to actually do it if it's important.)</div>

<div class="content">"Resolve" is another way of saying "I will not do all those other things".   Taken to an extreme, it cuts off exploration and innovation.<br><br>But exploration and innovation have their own extremes:  always exploring, never settling in and getting anything accomplished.<br><br>What's the right balance?</div>

<div class="content">There is no "right balance".  Pick a balance point you like, and if you feel you need more resolve or less, adjust.</div>

<div class="content">I am not believing in balance anymore as much as I am averages. Over the course of the week or month, am I averaging enough time talking to these people or exercising or working on these aspects of my life. Life sometimes dictates that I apply extreme focus to one area at the expense of another, but by the next week the situation may be reversed, and things average out again.<br><br>Also -- not every part of my life needs to be explored and plumbed for improvements. It depends on where I want to put my energy and focus. When some friends of ours had their first child, they decided that housecleaning, vacuuming, etc would just not be that important for the next few years, and resolving to turn a blind eye to that part of their lives gave them a lot of relief.</div>
