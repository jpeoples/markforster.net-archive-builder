<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-12-16 9:56</div>
<div class="content">I'm thinking that the last few posts in the "List Free" thread are so divergent from this idea of the value of faith and/or belief to productivity that a separate thread might be in order.  (Besides, that thread is groaning under the weight of posts now and even the "list free" idea should probably have a new thread ;-)<br><br>I think this is (no matter where you come down on the question) a very important component of productivity.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I agree that this issue of faith is very important wrt productivity. You seem to be of the mindset that religion is the opiate of the people. ;-) In some respects, I can't argue that. Believing that God is in control of this world gives me peace. But I would also argue that any system of belief, including atheism, serves the same purpose. For example, if a drunk driver hits and kills my spouse, I will think that God allowed this event for some good purpose and I will be comforted in believing that I will see my spouse in heaven again one day. In that same situation, you may find peace in believing that bad stuff just happens for no rhyme or reason and that good things are every bit as likely to happen. You might also find peace in believing that you could do something to help prevent the same tragedy in the future. However you dealt with it, I am quite sure you would use your beliefs to help you cope.<br><br>So I agree that our beliefs can give us peace and hope, but I disagree that faith is passivity. On the contrary, faith is the most active exercise I engage in, and I would argue that yours is, too. Constantly we receive input that does not fit within our personal framework of beliefs. We must work to either discard such input as an aberration, to explain it using our current belief system, or to change that belief system. I have done each of these. Although I am a devout Christian, no one who knows me would call me passive. My dh would LOL himself silly over that one. If you are subject to authority at work, are you then passive? I would say no, of course not. I believe my life and circumstances are subject to God's ultimate authority. That does not mean I do nothing. If I really believe in God and trust his authority, however, there is one thing I will not do--fear. However, when I lived by the "If it is to be, it is up to me" philosophy, fear was my constant companion.<br><br>To clarify, letting go does not mean doing nothing in my equation. It means doing what you feel called and are able to do (after some prayer and deliberation if need be) and then not fretting about the results. Jesus' asked a simple question about anxiety: "Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?" If worrying and going about life as though I was driving the bus worked, I am sure I would quickly return to that mode. But it doesn't! Even if you argue that fear is a good motivator, I can argue from science that there are much better motivators without the side effects.<br><br>Ball's in your court... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Mel,<br><br>>>>  Mike, I agree that this issue of faith is very important wrt productivity. You seem to be of the mindset that religion is the opiate of the people. ;-) <<<<br><br>I'd say that video games, web surfing, watching Cop shows and reality TV, eating chocolate, etc. all are as well.  Anything we LET distract us from creative and critical thought will be a form of opium.<br><br>>>>   In some respects, I can't argue that. Believing that God is in control of this world gives me peace. But I would also argue that any system of belief, including atheism, serves the same purpose. <<<<br><br>My point exactly.  Well, not "exactly", but close ;-)  I think it has to be a belief that allows you to "relax" in the feeling that "things will work out".  The first time I heard the phrase: "What does it matter, in 100 years we'll all be dead?" my feeling was a kind of "relaxation".  Yeah, what does this worry amount to?  In a few billion years the earth will be vaporized, after all.<br><br>I suppose that some wacko could use that thinking to justify almost any kind of insanity ... but that aside, it does put things in some perspective.  (And I said "not quite exactly" because atheism does not do that for you.  If anything, it removes that effect.  An atheist needs to find his opium elsewhere ;-)<br><br>>>>  For example, if a drunk driver hits and kills my spouse, I will think that God allowed this event for some good purpose and I will be comforted in believing that I will see my spouse in heaven again one day. In that same situation, you may find peace in believing that bad stuff just happens for no rhyme or reason and that good things are every bit as likely to happen. You might also find peace in believing that you could do something to help prevent the same tragedy in the future. However you dealt with it, I am quite sure you would use your beliefs to help you cope.  <<<<br><br>Now that is even MORE exactly what I meant.  Buddhism has it right, in my view.  (I don't view Buddhism as a religion, BTW.)  The Buddhist philosophy is that things happen the way they do in order for people to have the opportunity to learn and grow.  So they don't go about protesting social injustice (for the most part ... people are people, after all).  They see a social injustice as a kind of "test" that is there for them to overcome and use to grow.  Kind of like the sharpening stone is not to be feared by the knife blade.<br><br>>>>  So I agree that our beliefs can give us peace and hope, but I disagree that faith is passivity. On the contrary, faith is the most active exercise I engage in, and I would argue that yours is, too. <<<<br><br>What I was thinking was that faith allows us to become passive with respect to a thread or challenge and so deal with it more peacefully ... as you said above.<br><br>>>>  Constantly we receive input that does not fit within our personal framework of beliefs. We must work to either discard such input as an aberration, to explain it using our current belief system, or to change that belief system. I have done each of these. Although I am a devout Christian, no one who knows me would call me passive. <<<<br><br>Nor would I.  LOL ;-)<br><br>>>>  My dh would LOL himself silly over that one. If you are subject to authority at work, are you then passive? I would say no, of course not. I believe my life and circumstances are subject to God's ultimate authority. That does not mean I do nothing. If I really believe in God and trust his authority, however, there is one thing I will not do--fear. However, when I lived by the "If it is to be, it is up to me" philosophy, fear was my constant companion.  <<<<br><br>That is what I mean.  So long as you FOCUS on your need to "control" the outcome, there is a certain degree of tension.  Not that it is entirely bad ... I'm not saying that either.  Tension is necessary for life to work.  BUT, it is tension, none the less.  The moment you let the thought cross your mind that:<br><br>- In 100 years we'll all be dead<br>- It is up to God<br>- Inshal'Allah<br>- etc.<br><br>it is possible to experience a decrease in tension and, as you put it, "fear".<br><br>>>>  To clarify, letting go does not mean doing nothing in my equation.  <<<<br><br>No, I did not have that conception either.  I was speaking of an internal emotional state.  That said, there are many people who will actually cease to function because of those kinds of belief.  I'm sure you've seen that.  The people who when facing mounting debt will not look for work, but will go to church and pray for Ben Franklins to rain from the sky.<br><br>>>>  It means doing what you feel called and are able to do (after some prayer and deliberation if need be) and then not fretting about the results. <<<<br><br>Exactly.  It is a question of emotion, not action.<br><br>>>>  Jesus' asked a simple question about anxiety: "Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?" <<<<br><br>I've always liked the Buddhist parable of the mother and the mustard seed.  Similar idea, more powerfully crafted, I think.<br><br>>>>  If worrying and going about life as though I was driving the bus worked, I am sure I would quickly return to that mode. But it doesn't! Even if you argue that fear is a good motivator, I can argue from science that there are much better motivators without the side effects.  <<<<br><br>I agree.  I think, though, that motivators vary from person to person, and for the same person, from time to time.<br><br>>>>  Ball's in your court... :-) <<<<br><br><thwak> Back atcha ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>Grrrrr, this is my second attempt.  I got to almost the last word and POOOOOOF.  Grrrrr.<br><br>>>>  Mike, my new philosophy in tennis (gained by reading The Best Tennis of Your Life) is to learn something new every time I play. I've certainly learned something new from your post. I continue to be amazed by how much in agreement we are despite our diametrically opposed worldviews.  <<<<br><br>I would argue that our agreement indicates that we have similar world views. Yet see below.  I'm a bit confused.<br><br>>>>  I was not familiar with the Buddhist mustard seed parable, so went here to read it: <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/buddhistblog" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/buddhistblog</a> I think I understand the point of the story, but I can't accept it.  <<<<br><br>I went to that link and found the story pretty bloated.  It went on far beyond the original story, IIRC.  The words tended to obscure the point, which is very simple.<br><br>>>>  To bring it back to the original topic, this story is just "Let go..." There's no Let God. Just let go and let nothing. <<<<br><br>The larger point of the story is "non attachment".  The central point of Buddhism is that all suffering comes from attachment.  IOW, the more we have the more we are subject to sorrow at its loss.  The more we are tempted by envy, jealousy, coveting, etc.  In the Christian analog to the Buddhist sutra: "What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?"<br><br>The woman in the story was "attached" to her son ... but you have to understand that the idea of "attachment' is special in Buddhism.  But, not to go too far off track, basically she was blinded to the nature of things and the Buddha realized that words would never reach her so he gave her a task by which she would learn the the lesson on her own ... that there is a natural order to things which must be accepted.  What she wanted was not possible.  No one had ever "not died".<br><br><<<  I suppose this story is intended to give one a path to peace, but for me it promotes hopelessness.  <<<<br><br>For me, knowing that there is a natural order to things gives me peace.  My idea of a nightmare universe would be a world were things would happen arbitrarily.  Imagine if people could die, then arbitrarily pop up and walk away.  What sense could you make of the world.  If that were true, than people could just as easily die for no reason at all ... and I mean NO reason.  Likewise rocks could fly and pigs sing.  I could not live in a universe like that ... I doubt anyone could.  In fact if you think about it, those who are the most tortured with mental illness see the world exactly that way.<br><br>>>>  How differently I feel when I read this: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings+17&version=NIV" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings+17&version=NIV</a>  <<<<br><br>That story helps me understand why you found the first story troubling.  But I can't imagine getting hope from a story that is demonstrably unique. IOW, that person popped up and walked off in that story, but it almost never happens.  The story does not claim that anyone can pop up and walk off.  In fact, those who study Christian philosophy know to take that story metaphorically.  IOW, if you have faith you will be given life ... but that life is life in another world ... not this one.  The whole idea of Christianity is predicated on the next world.  <br><br>>>>  How we think of our end certainly has implications for how we think of our present circumstances, how we respond to them emotionally, and how we act. <<<<br><br>Yes, it does.  Moreover it is not necessarily our end.  Simply thinking that "it will all work out", or "it is not THAT important", or "at least I have my health" (or whatever) tends to relieve stress and clear the road a bit.  That is why I broadened the question to more than just religious belief.  I think it is ANY belief that removes pressure.  Wiccans and members of the CRS (Church of Religious Science) tend to not believe so much in a god, but in the power of "intention".  IOW, they have certain incantations which will bring about intended result ... but the way they structure it, the result will occur even if it does not occur (to put my usual spin on it ;-).  So, they believe in the outcome, to the point that they KNOW it has already happened but it's time has not come quite yet (if that makes any sense to you ... it does not to me ;-).  They are now just waiting to get the result.  (For it to "manifest", is the way they put it.)  A central tenant to that system is that they have to "put the intention out there then forget about it".  The specific instruction is to no longer think about it, but believe (have faith) that it has already happened.  Of course, the way the human mind is constructed, they will then interpret almost anything in a way that proves it has worked.<br><br>You see this in astrology a lot.  The practitioner does your chart and tells you that you will meet someone "tall dark and handsome".  Well, you meet some one short, blond and fat who works in the office where the manager is tall, dark and handsome so are told that the prophecy actually DID come true, in it's own way.  Or you wish for a new house and find a sale at the pet store for 90% off on dog houses.  If you express consternation you are told that you DID in fact get your new house ... it is just that the "intention" you put "into the universe" was not specific enough.  It is all very silly, but it follows the way our minds tend to work when turned loose to roam freely and unsupervised.  ;-)<br><br>NOTE:  I am not saying that this kind of thing is entirely useless.  It is not.  Managed properly, "intention" and "expectation" can harness features of the human mind that help in numerous ways.  But like all good things, these things must be understood and used correctly to help very much.<br><br>>>>  Thanks so much for hitting one back. ;-)  <<<<br><br>Not at all.  I was out getting the Wii Fit+ for Lisa today.  Over the holiday her mother will get her the console and she will be happily playing Wii tennis ;-)  I will work on the fitness part a bit more and I think that it will help my balance ... which is not starting to suffer a bit because of my age.  I actually have a fair chance of beating Lisa in Wii tennis as it is not "real" tennis so her much higher skill level will not buy her as much as she thinks.  My knowledge of computers might just carry the day ;-) ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Andreas.<br><br>Mike:<br>>>I would argue that our agreement indicates that we have similar world views.<< <br>If you mean apart from the fact that you do not believe in God or a creation and I do, then I suppose that’s possible. ;-)<br>>>The larger point of the story is "non attachment".

We would all do well to become less attached to money, status, things, etc. and Christianity is very much in agreement with Buddhism in this. As I write though, I am thinking this whole argument turns on definitions. If attachment is love, then attachment is vital. If attachment is a self-centered dependency, then we are better off without it. The Bible (which is my faith reference book) says we ought to love one another, but does say that we ought not to be too attached to the world or even our loved ones in it. In contrast to Buddhism, though, we are offered a relationship with God that is worthy of eternal attachment as well as the promise of seeing our deceased loved ones in heaven one day.<br><br>>>she would learn the the lesson on her own ... that there is a natural order to things which must be accepted.<< <br><br>See, acceptance is a word that resonates with me.

It is hard to judge by emails but we seem to see the world similarly in more ways than differently ... which is more what I mean by "world view" than specific theories of things.<br><br>>>>  >>The larger point of the story is "non attachment". The central point of Buddhism is that all suffering comes from attachment. IOW, the more we have the more we are subject to sorrow at its loss.

Actually, the term I used was "non attachment" which, as understood in this way of thinking means something very different than "detachment".  I don't think it is profitable to try to get deeply into Buddhist philosophy in email ;-) but maybe the difference between "assertion" and "aggression" might be similar.  Terms that seem interchangeable to some but very different to others.  And, as you say below, much of this turns on how one understands terminology.<br><br>>>>  Of course the mother was attached to her son! And I don’t think you would argue that she shouldn’t have been. <<<<br><br>Well, as I said, in the Buddhist view, not so much.  You have to understand that in the Buddhist view, the things of the world, including other people, are important to us only in that they provide a context for our spiritual growth.  The goal is to "transcend" attachment to those things.  But then that is far from the original point of the affect of belief on productivity.  ;-)<br><br>>>>  Attachment to people is a much different thing than envy, jealousy, coveting as you say. <<<<br><br>Yes, but attachment to anything leads to these problems.  At least in this view.  And in Christianity there are "commandments" and one of those coveting the neighbors wife.<br><br>>>>  We would all do well to become less attached to money, status, things, etc. and Christianity is very much in agreement with Buddhism in this. <<<<br><br>It is actually more in agreement than many know.  The Gospel of Thomas is very close to literal Buddhist philosophy but was ordered destroyed by the Catholic church so copies were buried deep in a cave to preserve them.  Much of the difference between modern Christianity and Buddhism is due to massive editing by a Pope.  (His minions, actually.)  There is even a theory that during the "missing years" Jesus was in India studying Buddhism.  There is some evidence to that effect, but who knows?<br><br>>>>  As I write though, I am thinking this whole argument turns on definitions.  <<<<br><br>Very true.<br><br>>>> If attachment is love, then attachment is vital. If attachment is a self-centered dependency, then we are better off without it. <<<<br><br>Herman Hesse wrote an excellent exposition of Buddhism (semi-fictional) called "Siddhartha".

<div class="content">Mike,<br>It is rather bizarre that we agree in so many ways considering our views on faith, our life circumstances, and even our personalities are so very different. Non attachment doesn't give me any more warm fuzzies than detachment. lol But the concept of relationships being the way we grow is something I accept and is really part of my Christian understanding of life. Unfortunately, I think few people really grasp that idea and instead cling to the notion that people are really there to serve their needs. It relates to the shopping, doesn't it? It's a challenge to not be self-centered.<br><br>As for what you wrote about the pope, the content of the Bible, and Jesus allegedly studying Buddhism, I could spend time giving my opinion on church history. I'm not Catholic, so I'm sure my opinion would be offensive to some here. Then I could cite sources defending my position. I debated a little in college, so I would find this to be great fun. :-) But I discovered something several years ago when having one of these debates with a friend who is not a Christian. He argued that the Dead Sea scrolls do not support the integrity of the Scriptures as written and I argued that they do. But neither of us have ever actually seen them or read them. We're basing our arguments upon what other people say about them. So any discussions of this sort really rest upon one issue in my opinion: who do you trust?<br><br>As you say, science itself is devoid of human bias, but science cannot exist without human beings. Unless you believe there is a perfect alien race out there somewhere experimenting. Or you agree with Richard Dawkins that computers may one day become conscious through evolution and could be the source of science. (By the way, I do not understand why he doesn't see the nonsense in this as computers were intelligently designed). So having worked with scientists and having known the kinds of people that put out the research that people oooh and aaaah over, I cannot trust science. <br><br>What I like about this whole notion, Mike, is that it allows you and I to agree to disagree peaceably. It's like our discussion of computers. If you've had a bad experience with Apple and you don't trust Apple, I can understand that. Just like I've had a bad experience with HP and don't trust them. You get that. What I find so unfortunate is that because I don't trust science in many different areas, I am labeled ignorant or a "denier" by many people who DO trust science. I happen to trust the God of the Bible, but I understand that many people do not and cannot. It would be just as wrong for me to label them as though I'm superior.<br><br>So what on earth does this have to do with TM? I think what we trust in makes a big difference to how we approach it. There are plenty of life change gurus who would argue that I need to believe in myself, for example. IMO, that is very foolish advice, because I know very well what I am capable of. :-) In my experience, trusting in anything or anyone but God is a dangerous thing. Now does that mean I am paranoid and distrusting of my dh, for example? No. I trust him, but I don't believe he is impervious to temptation in the right situation. Just as I am not. Perhaps this is why I am currently not using a list. I am really rejecting the notion of a "trusted system." On the other hand, just as I trust my dh in general, I can use Google calendar with basic trust that I will be reminded.<br><br>I have no idea how to end this post, so I will just say thanks for the great discussion! Have a happy weekend.</div>

<div class="content">Mike and Mel:<br><br>Hmmm.... much as I love discussing these questions myself (and I've read nearly all the documents mentioned) I don't think this forum is the right place. I don't want to be too severe about keeping strictly to the topic of this website, but please try to come back in its general direction!</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I hear 'ya.  I've responded to Mel on her list.  If anyone else things the more general idea we started with is worth discussing, we can continue on here.<br><br>Mel,<br><br>See ya over on your AF list.</div>
