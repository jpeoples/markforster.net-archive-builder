If so, how often did you record your responses?  <br><br>Any other tips would be helpful.</div>

<div class="content">Hm, perhaps few have tried the above. <br><br>I've been tracking my time with RescueTime (for web use) and Eternity iPhone app. At the end of the week, I copy/paste both graphs next to each other to see how my week went. I find it mildly motivating. Mark's suggestion - monitoring your mood - is interesting, particularly if each log has an brief entry about what you're dong. I'm still not sure if "mood" or "time" is what I'm most interested in. <br><br>Actually, I've been doing this:<br>https://www.trackyourhappiness.org/people/5617<br>for the past two weeks. Very interesting.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, I don't do this but try to practice the 4:8 Principle (book by Tommy Newberry). What I WAS interested in was more information about Mark surviving a helicopter crash.</div>

<div class="content">Ur a therapist?<br><br>Here is what I track at the end of my day everyday:<br><br>Who and what did I harm or thoughtlessly take for granted.<br>What was I given or how I was supported.<br>What did I offer in return.<br><br>A time limit is imposed, the first question alone is never-ending. And I sometimes I simply take a single item or person and pose those questions around that.<br><br>"Happiness" is over-rated. I find the attachment  to the vicissitudes of my moods and the attempt to cultivate a particular one seem pallid in light of the ridiculous generosity of the world around me no matter how little I offer in return.<br><br>Of course, the caveat for folks who are profoundly disordered or have been harmed, but even then this practice can be of benefit.  Read an amazing account of a woman who after years of therapy attempting to come to terms with being raped, engaged in this practice and found a degree of serenity and compassion for even her attacker.<br><br>She allowed her written entries to be shared with others beginning their practice.<br><br>AF is helpful for this practice because it does give an account of some of my behaviors throughout the day in addition to helping me discern how to direct my energy.<br><br>In my experience, this kinda practice is of more benefit if shared regularly with another more experience doing.</div>

<div class="content">Norman - incredible that you'd take the time to answer a question I was NOT asking.</div>

<div class="content">You're welcome. As you know, often the question that is unasked is often the most telling.<br><br>I'll mark you down under my "how I helped" column tonight.</div>

<div class="content">I think Norman has two important points.  Thinking about how you're feeling may have some benefit, but there is another approach.<br><br>1) Develop your ability to move beyond your feelings and don't let them hold you back.  (Difficult skill, but invaluable to the extent you attain it.)<br>2) Instead of thinking "am I happy?", think about good things.  Love, beauty, kindness, things that work well, friendship, success.  While introspection may be helpful, this kind of reflection may be even more helpful.</div>

<div class="content">One of my favorite quotes comes from an interview with Bob Dylan in the early 90's-- <br><br>"Happiness is not on my list of priorities. I just deal with day-to-day things. If I’m happy, I’m<br>happy–and if I’m not, I don’t know the difference…"</div>

<div class="content">Norman, not sure if you were addressing me or Avrum. I am a clinical psychologist not presently practicing. My philosophy is markedly different than most mainstream psychologists, however.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, it was irony. Any other irony I could add would lost, since he is no longer among us.</div>
