<div class="content">Hello,<br><br>I've just discovered AF2, and I can see how it can prevent the "getting stuck" syndrome, but there is one thing I'm not so sure about. You say that Home and Work list may be mixed, because dismissing is more forgiving (more precisely, it's not an "all or nothing" thing). I work on my Home list only on weekends, and on my Work list every work day. I'm afraid I'm going to have Home tasks creep up on the list at the beginning of the week, and if I follow the procedure, they would get dismissed with no chance of being acted upon. Am I missing something, or should I keep two separate lists?</div>

<div class="content">I keep 4 AF lists and this works perfect for me.  I work from home but I run 2 businesses so I have 2 lists for my work stuff, one for home and one for my band.  I check the lists at different times of the day, so when I am working on business #1, I check that list.  In the afternoons I switch to business #2 so I go to that AF list.  In the evenings and weekends I check my home list and I set aside one evening a week for managing my band tasks.  This may not work for everyone, but separate lists work great for me.</div>

<div class="content">I'm in a similar position, but I'm going to try to maintain the system as one list. The reason for this is that I *can* do home tasks during the week, just not all that many of them (I work quite long hours). With AF, there was really too much choice when I got back home from work, and I tended to just slack-off. While that's normally fine, I like the 'hard' dismissal rules of AF2 - any given evening there's likely to be one or two home tasks which will be 'on notice' for dismissal, and that and the restricted choice of tasks could be just the motivation I need to get them ticked-off during the week.<br><br>If there isn't anything coming up for dismissal any time soon, then I can slack off without guilt (or add 'slack off without guilt' to the end of my AF list!). On the other hand, if some home tasks get dismissed, I can always pick them up when I do a weekly review at the end of the week, and do them on the weekend; at least the dismissal process will help me choose exactly what these tasks will be.<br><br>Mark - thanks for publishing the instructions. Early days yet, but so far I really like AF2; just the changes I needed for my work/lifestyle. I imagine that, what with expanding your instructions for the system and elaborating on the changes to your thinking since DIT, you probably have enough material for a decent-size book/ebook there. Which I for one would happily pay for.</div>
