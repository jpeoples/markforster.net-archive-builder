<div class="content">Thanks, Mark, for letting us try out your new system. It is very different and I'm still trying to get my head round aspects of it.<br><br> I have a query about batching tasks. In my current system, all tasks which are 'Errands' are listed together so that if I am going out, say to buy some new furniture, then I can easily see other tasks that can be carried out at the same time, e..g. pick up tickets for the panto that I booked the week before. With Autofocus, if I choose to do the task 'Buy furniture' on one page, I'm not necessarly going to see the other errands that I could be doing on the same journey.<br><br>I've started writing a large E on the righthandside of each task which is an errand so that they stand out and I can scan them all, but that doesn't seem to fit your instructions. So along with lists for 'Work' and 'Home', should I have another list called 'Errands? <br><br>-Linda</div>

<div class="content">Linda,<br><br>I noticed the same thing about batching. I had a few tasks for Bob on my list. When Bob came into my office I had to look all over the list for the Bob tasks. It would have helped to write "Bob" on the far right, so that I could pull them out easily.<br><br>Likewise for my recurring tasks. As I did each recurring task today, I wrote the task again at the end of my list, so that I would do it again tomorrow. But instead of merely writing the task, I wrote the task with tomorrow's date on the far right. That way, tomorrow, throughout the day, I can scan the right side of my lists to verify that I've completed all my recurrent daily tasks for that day.<br><br>My judgment is that it still remains an open question whether AF works better for me than DIT. I am glad that Mark has given me the opportunity to test it. It is extraordinarily clever in the manner in which it harnesses the rigidity of closed lists with the freedom of "anything goes." I am glad Mark retired. If he was still working, he probably never would have come up with this.<br><br>moises</div>

<div class="content">Linda, moises,<br><br>You both bring up some good points and I think the system can be adapted, it's sort of like an open source project: Mark gives us the source code - the Autofoucs system and each person builds on it to the way it best works for them. Some will use Outlook, some OneNote, Evernote, Pocket Informant, ListPro, a loose leaf binder, a steno pad, a Moleskine, and perhaps index cards.<br><br>Linda, you could record your errands in the Autofocus list and also record them on an index card labeled "Errands" you put in your pocketbook. Listing is sort of like David Allen's "mind dump" and by setting up a context card or little memo pad you can save time and gas doing those errands, one of the few times I've found contexts to be useful.<br><br>I like the idea both of you have of making notations in the margins to catch things. I work in sales support for a retail store and collect numerous tasks each day that I delegate to my staff. Putting some sort of notation beside the task would help me weed out the things I need others to handle and once I've got them corralled into one list for my associate, I could put "Follow up XYZ - Brian" at the bottom of my list.<br><br>Good luck with the trial,<br>Clay</div>

<div class="content">I also have started using index cards that I put in my Moleskine (with a paper clip).  <br><br>One card is my Inbox which I clip to the front cover of my Moleskine (in the inside).  Here I record all thoughts and information that come at me during the day that is not a task.  As soon as is feasible I transfer this information to computer or task list (if it becomes evident that I need to follow up on it).  Each item on the card is then crossed off when dealt with.<br><br>I have a couple of other index cards each with a person's name on it.  These are the people that I see on a regular basis (for instance my wife).  I collect what I need to share, followup, or do with that person on their designated index card.  When accomplished or shared, I then cross the item off.<br><br>Though I use a PDA (Handyshopper) for my errands, one could use an index card to collect these as well and when out and about, pull it out.  <br><br>Another card could have Morning will-do's and/or leaving-work-will-do's.  These are batched tasks which are repeated each day or every other day.  <br><br>This system alleviates hunting for batched tasks and cluttering the task list.  I just write in my Auto focus task list : "Call  so and so"  or "Do errands" or "Morning will-do" etc....<br><br>I hope this helps.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your comments, everyone. They have all been helpful. I think I will use an index card for errands - simple and effective. If I lose the card, I can recreate it from my master list.<br><br>I like your suggestion, Clay, that the system can be treated as an open source project - with everyone giving it their own 'tweak' according to prefererence/need. But perhaps we should do, as Mark says, and just work the system as it is described before trying to adapt it too far from the source.<br><br>I really hope this system can help me crack the procrastination habit. I have a batch of student papers to grade, which has been sitting on my desk since 22nd December and MUST be done by the end of the week. It's the first thing on my list and it's the one thing NOT standing out for me - I think it must have been written in invisible ink!<br><br>Linda</div>

<div class="content">Moises:<br><br>This is fine when the tasks really are once-a-day tasks. But what I found was that a lot of my "daily tasks" under DIT were actually no such thing. So I now clear email several times a day, tidy my desk regularly (but yesterday not at all), and so on. I rely on the system to tell me how often and when to do these actions. I find it works far better.</div>

<div class="content">Linda:<br><br>Your example of the student papers show one of the problems with batching (which in general I think is a good idea). The batch can be very big and therefore easily resisted.<br><br>Try re-writing the task as "Sort student papers into order" or some such. Then keep re-entering it as small steps.</div>

<div class="content">"But what I found was that a lot of my "daily tasks" under DIT were actually no such thing."<br><br>This was quite an eye-opener for me...  Since yesterday, I had been asking myself how I could find a way to add those 'once a day' tasks to my list.  When I have done one of those things (e.g. doing a load of laundry, one of my typical 'once a day' things at home), and I enter it on what is my last page now, it keeps coming up several times today, and I'm not necessarily able to do the task (laundry machine still running, second load will be done when the drying line is not free yet...).  But now I realize that's OK...  When it isn't the right moment to do the task, it just won't 'stand out', and when the moment's ready, it's still on my list.  Maybe today, but it also might be tomorrow.  <br><br>How would you do for the non-daily repeating tasks? I was thinking I should add them to a 'reminder based system' , and once the reminder comes up, I add the task to my paper list.</div>

<div class="content">Anne:<br><br>That's what I do with them. For instance I have to wind my antique carriage clock weekly. I have a reminder set in Outlook. Every time it comes up I enter it on the paper list and set the reminder to "snooze" for another week.</div>

<div class="content">I also like to 'Open Source' concept.<br><br>Some initial thoughts on batching:<br><br>Batch is formed with many elements - time, place, people, kind of work, etc.  One item may have more than one batch code (Do it on Tuesdays with Boss at the Office).  Do we create codes for each element?<br><br>Some items come with time limits imposed from outside.  A comprehensive system need to have inherent checks for time based tasks.  How 'Auto' is a system where you need a reminder from Outlook, write on a notebook, set the reminder in Outlook again, do the task, and strike out from the notebook? Somewhere we need to bring-in a time element for time specific tasks.  Electronic tools have 'push' feature (it tells you) while paper and pen system is 'pull' based (you check it).  If you have more than hundred tasks, how do you 'pull' the current batch?<br><br>Lastly, how does one get the sense of 'history' of a big task/project?  (How much we have done, how many times, when, did we do part of the work?)  In other words, how do you 'batch' the actions under a particular project/multi-step task?<br><br>Thanks to all for interesting posts, and to Mark for giving this opportunity.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi folks,<br>I need a bit of guidance.  In the past I have used project pages (with headings like Taxes or Mend Clothes) and then beneath the heading I list the Simple Steps (label folder, order tax software, or pull out sewing kit, pick new buttons, etc.).  That way I can always see the next simplest step and help reduce resistance.  However, for this new system, do I put the large project (Taxes) on the list and keep a separate sheet still for the individual simple steps or put the simple steps right on the big list?<br><br>Thanks for your thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">Janis: <br><br>You can use either approach, or a mixture of both. I suggest you experiment to find which suits you best. I tend to use a mixture of project headings, e.g. Taxes, and simple steps, e.g. order tax software, but without keeping a list of steps. This is because I know what needs to be done to get my tax return done, but as it's a high resistance project it helps to break it down a bit.</div>
