<div class="content">After several years, I reread Mark's first book Get Everything Done, which I always considered one of his best contributions. And I was surprised - first how much I forgot and second, how many interesting tips which I had tried that days but have forgotten since I found in the book again. <br><br>I have been evolving my own approaches to my work for years. I am much more experienced with both mistakes and good approaches and I think that I can see much more insight in what was written in the book than I used to be when I read it for the first time. Tomorrow, I am starting commitment audit + some checklist rotating techniques. <br><br>Thanks, Mark and my recommendation to all users of the forum - try to reread some of Mark's book/article which you valued previously, but have not read for quite a time. You might be surprised.</div>
