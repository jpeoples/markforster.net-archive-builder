<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-28 1:24</div>
<div class="content">Thank you for the many comments on my second post. I found most of them very interesting and learned a lot.<br><br>I respond only today because I was too busy until this morning.<br><br>On my side of the world it is summer and I was mostly busy taking my grandson to the beach and catching up with expat friends that had come home for a summer break. School started again today and that gives me time to write. Nobody needs to fear that the doctor will come anytime soon because of me being dramatically overworked.<br><br>To Mark Forster:<br><br>I did say in my first post that I was too busy to beta-test. So, yes, I am just theorizing. But AF being as simple as it is, it is not difficult to imagine how it would work with my present workload (beautifully) or with my prior workload (crash within the hour). In the meantime at least one of the posters here gave AF up for reasons similar to those I had mentioned, so that it is not all theory any more.<br><br>However, you said what I believe is essential:<br><br>Being really busy means being focused.<br><br>And you added that nobody is really productive if he is just hectically busy. That reminds me of my entrepreneur days when I kept telling my people that a productive workshop is a place of peace and quiet.<br><br>One commenter mentioned the necessary slack time to be able to respond to the unexpected. That too is important and often overlooked. You are most productive if you generally work at about 95% of your capacity. That is true for individuals as well as for whole factories.<br><br>If I do not beta-test AF that is because I do have a system that works well for me (customized DIT) and because I do not want to spend the necessary time on it. Testing productivity systems is not in my focus. Right now I want to achieve other things.<br><br>Staying informed about productivity systems is one of the things I do want to do, with a very limited time budget. That is why I will continue to be a fence-sitter and enjoy some of the posts here. I thank you all in advance!<br><br>If only Mark could install a better forum system. This one is a real pain to use. I deliberately started yet another thread to spare you the pain of having to scroll through it all again. I understand the logic now, but that does not make it any better.<br><br>All the best to you all!<br><br>Chris<br><br>P.S. I can't refrain from this one after having seen the slightly off-topic last posts on the AF vs. GTD revisited thread :-)<br><br>Throw you Windows PCs out the window and buy Macintoshes - I did that years ago and never regretted. Even Macintoshes are not perfect, but I only want to throw it out the window once day, before that it was once every hour, at least. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris<br><br>Sounds like you're in a nice part of the world - I might be near the beach but on a cold, gray January day it doesn't have the same appeal!<br><br>I know you say that you can imagine how AF works but one of the surprising things about AF is that you actually can't imagine how it works.  Oh, the mechanics of the system are easy enough (in fact they seem too simple) but it's the impact it has on <br>"freeing the mind" that is the key.  That can only be experienced by trying it.  I don't know if you've read a lot of the stuff that's around regarding lef brain/right brain, "being in the flow" etc.  There is a lot of very weird stuff out there but in a nutshell, with AF Mark has found a system that almost instantly places you in that "flow" state.  Unless you try it for yourself I would say it is virtually impossible to get your head around.<br><br>As someone in a significant state of overwhelm at the start of this exercise, the difference has been amazing.  Prior to AF I was incredibly busy (and still am) - the difference being that I am now working at a significantly higher level of productivity, which enables me to do (a) the things that need to be done (b) the things I want to do, and (c) the things that help me to learn and progress, such as reading and posting in this forum.<br><br>Could I ask you just to try an experiment - would you be willing to just give the system a practical rather than a theoretical trial for a period of time, doing the system just as Mark wrote it, and doing it seriously?  I would be really interested to hear your views after you have tested it for yourself as time management is clearly something you have researched seriously.  <br><br>Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>not to devalue your point in any way, but I would say my experience of 'flow' has been more prevalent with DIT than with AF. The reason for this (I believe) is that the structure of DIT allows me to reduce and control 'random factors' easier than in AF. I also know with DIT that urgent items are getting taken care of quickly in a well structured system. In my view, this frees me up to get into the 'flow state' more readily.</div>

<div class="content">To me 'getting into the flow' doesn't depend on the system I use (GTD, DIT, AF, or none at all), but on the type of work and whether my own skill level matches the required skill level of the task.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris,<br><br>I get that you have a system that works.  I even get that you are interested in systems.  What I don't get is how you can evaluate a system you don't try.  But then that's just me.<br><br>I am also not sure that the way the forum works is all that important in the big scheme of things.<br><br>As to Macs vs. PC, that is all well and good if you don't mind overpaying for everything, hardware, software, perpetuals.  It is also a pain when you want software and the producer does not see the point in producing it for such a limited market.  I think there is more chance of Unix becoming a viable system than Macs, being useful for those of us who are not devoted to Macs, just because they are Macs. I know artists who love Macs, with reason, but for business use ... not so much.  But then that is just me ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon<br><br>Thanks for your comment and I totally understand your point.  It is very clear that a lot of people work very well with the structure of a more defined system like DIT - which I wholeheartedly agree is a fantastic system.  That structure would certainly enable "flow" - actually I hate that term, just not found anything else that is universally recognisable :-)  - and particularly in a work environment (with other people around to motivate/interrupt or just add to "the list") I would definitely see that as an advantage.  For me, working from home with little human interruption, the tendency to procrastinate is strong, and a structured system makes it worse.  That is me - not the system.<br><br>The whole definition of "being in the flow" is, I believe, not so much related to the task/s at hand, or the ease or complexity of those tasks, but rather to the feeling that the "doing" of those tasks is happening easily, naturally, and in a way hard to define, enjoyably.  <br><br>If I go back to an example I gave in an earlier post, that of my "stack/unstack the dishwasher" task, I had a real resistance to the task.  It was not difficult.  I had the ability to do it.  It was not a big task. I could do it in a minute or two.  The problem was the fact that that I was imposing an "ought" onto the task, and in an attempt to manage that resistance a "when I ought" to it as well.  Once I identified that the actual resistance was the fact that I did not like being told what to do and when to do it (even though it was myself doing the telling!) the resistance went.  I am now happy to deal with the dishwasher "when I feel like it".  I "know" it "needs" to be done but that is just common sense - I don't need to be nagged (by myself) to recognise that.  And now I quite enjoy doing it because, rather than feeling obligated my mind is usually processing other things I want to do next ......<br><br>A rather long explanation but in short "flow" or intuitive working is about ease *and* enjoyment, not one or the other.  If something is easy but we don't enjoy it we are not "in the flow".  If something is enjoyable, but we feel we should be doing something else or feel guilty about doing that task now, then that is not being in the flow.<br><br>Hopes that makes some more sense .....  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Rainer<br><br>I think we may be using different definitions here.  I have just posted above to Leon my use of the phrase (which I still dislike!) but know what you mean.  I think I would refer to that more as being able to be totally focused on the task at hand (possibly to the exclusion of other outside factors) but regardless of my ability to action the task I would not necessarily consider those occasions to always feel enjoyable and to be the thing I most want to be doing at that given point in time. Hope that clarifies what I mean a little better ........</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>Sorry, but I will not try AF for the time being for the reasons I mentioned.<br><br>However, early in my career I have been using a simple to-do list for many years, not unlike AF at all, it usually had many pages and I used to use it not in the same way but in a similar way, always going through all the open items before choosing what to do next. I am experienced enough to imagine what the page-induced item groups and the differences in processing the list will do to improve the system. <br><br>It is clear to me that my knowledge is limited because of my lack of practical experience with AF and I try to allow for these limitations in what I write here. I am also completely honest and tell you and everybody else that I did and do not use AF so that you can choose to completely ignore what I write if you feel like that.<br><br>I do not evaluate AF. I do not criticize AF, quite the contrary: I say that it will probably work very well with my present work-load. <br><br>Therefore I feel entitled to post here.<br><br>My main point actually is, that AF - despite its beauty - is NOT the silver bullet, the system that will forever make all other systems obsolete. I had had the impression of having read that somewhere between the lines, and that is what triggered my first post. It reminded me of the early days of GTD and silly and pointless discussions among some of the early adopters.<br><br>Si tacuisses … I know :-) Alas too late.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Overpaying for Macs.<br><br>If you consider the cost of ownership of a PC and a Mac over their useful life for you, you will find that you are overpaying for Windows PCs except in some very particular situations like private PC usage by a professional PC administrator.<br><br>That Macs lacks software used to be true until about 4 -5  years ago, but is not true any more.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris<br><br>I totally respect your opinion - you have every right not to try AF for yourself.  I would have been very interested in your opinion after trying the system as you clearly have looked at systems in depth and I, for one, am very glad you are posting!<br><br>You are absolutely right that AF will not be for everyone.  Many, many people go through life "just doing it" without the need for any system whatsoever, and others find a system that suits them very quickly.  I love systems and get a great deal of satisfaction in creating systems for individuals and businesses.  My approach is always to tailor the solution to the individual rather than the other way around as it is never a case of "one size fits all".  I can create systems with no problem (the first system I created to beat procrastination was when I was probably aged about 7, which I think in itself illustrates the fact that I have had a problem with procrastination from an early age!), but find it very difficult to stick to a system, even the ones I have devised myself!  AF is the first approach that I genuinely believe will work for me, and experience leads me to believe that if it works for me then there are probably a few other struggling beings that it will work for as well.  If that makes me over zealous in "spreading the news" then so be it...:-)<br><br>I first heard Mark speak at a conference in 2002 and found his ideas and tips immensely helpful.  Every system he has developed has been of significant benefit and I have immense respect for his ability in this area. Consequently I had no hesitation in trying his new system, which as you will probably guess exceeded my expectations.  The difficulty in explaining its' impact, and how it works, is, of course, because it is intuitive, and I think that aspect of it can therefore only be understood fully by trying it.<br><br>If you do ever decide you have the inclination to give it a go I for one would be interested in your opinion........<br><br>Hope you're still enjoying the summer....... <br></div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>Although like Christine I respect your decision not to try AF, I still think it's impossible to judge how effective a system is going to be until you've tried it. AF surprised me (and still does) by its effectiveness. It would have been impossible for me to judge it without trying it.</div>

<div class="content">I just can second Mark. I also started with many theoretical questions (I have read many books about time management and tried many systems) and was very skeptical, thought it wouldn't work. But then I followed the advice to just try it and to trust the system... and I'm still very enthusiastic about it.</div>
