<div class="content">I was under the impression that we were supposed to complete the active page (or dismiss all items) before moving on to the next page.  Somebody on another group told me that you only have to do *one* thing.  Clearly I'm confused.<br><br>Sorry for so many dumb questions.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Zack<br><br>No question is ever dumb - you just have not found the answer yet :-)<br><br>You pass through the first active page and do the item/items that stand out.  You only have to do one item per page before you can move on but may do more.  You only dismiss items if they do not stand out "on the first pass".  Have a look at the video about AF (link on left of page) That should help you, and have another look at the FAQ's - if you are still stuck then do feel free to post again and I'll look out some specific threads that deal with this.  <br><br>Good luck!</div>
