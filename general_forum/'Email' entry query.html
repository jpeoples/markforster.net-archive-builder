<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>As someone who gets a lot of my work in via email (answering questions etc), I'd like to understand what your entry "email" means.  Does that mean answering your emails, or simply tells you to review your emails and then you add any requiring actions to your open list?<br><br>I'm finding that when I get to "email" I start working my way through them (lets say at 1pm), and then realise it's time to go home (which for me is 6pm) and I haven't done anything on my open list, as I've spent the whole time answering emails.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Donna</div>

<div class="content">Donna,<br><br>I can't speak for Mark (obviously), but the way I - and a number of others, I believe - use the "email" task would probably work fairly well for you. In my case it's based on thinking I encoutered via GTD (its "processing" step) and 'Inbox Zero'.<br><br>Whenever my email task stands out I aim to do a pass through each item in the inbox, and determine what action(s) need to be taken. These actions are then either done immediately if they're very short (e.g. using GTD's "2 minute" principle), or recorded in an appropriate list/system and the email deleted or filed for reference.<br><br>Actions recorded might be (one or more of):<br>- "Read/review Bob's email of 7/9" added to your AF list  [e.g. for long or highly detailed message]<br>- An appointment added to your calendar<br>- A reminder or 'waiting for' task added to a tickler file (or equivalent reminder system)<br>- "Respond to Alice's email about the party" added to your AF list<br>- etc.<br><br>Regardless of action(s) noted or taken, the message can then be immediately deleted (if no longer needed) or archived/filed (for reference, or because still needed when taking the noted actions). The noted action(s) should include just enough info to easily find the original email and/or the relevant information required to act upon it (e.g. in an electronic system like Outlook this may simply be a copy of the whole original message within the new Task item, on paper it may be just the relevant sender & date, phone #, etc.).<br><br>The basic principle is to separate managing the stream of incoming items vs the doing of the necessary actions in response - a little bit like triage in a hospital. The "collection bucket" - i.e. the Inbox - stays at/near zero items in length with relatively short 'processing scans', and actions are tracked along with all your other tasks ensuring that your intuition can prioritise from amongst *all* your tasks (whether email-initiated or not).<br><br>You may therefore actually write the "email" task as something like "Process email inbox to determine actions" (until that's the habit, when for simplicity it probably starts getting shorter and shorter until it's just "Email"!).<br><br>It's not the only way to approach email, but I think it would help avoid/manage the kind of scenario you outline. [Note: it doesn't mean you won't spend all afternoon responding to email - your work may well require that - but you'd be doing so by actively choosing multiple email-based tasks in succession from your whole list, rather than getting "suckered into it" from the single list item.]<br><br>Hope that helps,<br>Steve<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the ideas Steve.<br><br>I have a similar problem with losing hours in my email box.  I think processing it like you describe will mean I am consciously choosing what is right to do next rather than just defaulting to the next email.<br><br>I'm going to process the forty or so mails in my InBox this afternoon and see how it works having them in AF4 instead.<br><br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">In addition to the processing tips offered by SteveB, which are all very good, I'd also suggest using a timer.  Set a timer (or an Outlook reminder) to tell you to stop in 15 minutes (or 5 minutes, or 45 minutes, or whatever seems appropriate).  Process your email till the timer beeps.  At that point, stop immediately (mid-sentence if need be), cross Email off your AF list, add it again at the end, and keep moving through AF.<br><br>While it might prevent you from reaching "Inbox Zero" sometimes, it helps keep you from getting sucked in for too long.  <br><br>I use this trick all the time, especially when I have many medium-sized tasks, each of which is important, and each of which could easily suck me in for hours if I let it.</div>

<div class="content">One of my friends is a head teacher and his tip for e-mail (apparently he gets tons) is to set up a rule so cc e-mails go into a separate folder, leaving only to's in the in-box.  He looks at the cc's weekly quuickly.</div>
