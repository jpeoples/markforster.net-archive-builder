<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-10-19 1:41</div>
<div class="content">It’s been five weeks since I created my first closed list on September 15 and it’s time for me to assess my progress with DIT.<br><br>First, I will explain what aspects of DIT I am not doing.<br><br>I have not been doing Current Initiatives. I am not opposed to them. I just haven’t found the need or desire to implement them yet.<br><br>I have not done any kind of timed bursts or any other of the timing methods that Mark discusses. I have done similar things in the past. Again, they can be a very effective tool and it’s good to know that they are available if and when I need them.<br><br>I have used the self-talk recommendations a few times in the early weeks, but haven't had to use them since. I am referring to the kind of talk that has the form: "I won't write the employee evaluation now, I will just take out this folder."<br><br>Second, I will give some explanation of the way I have chosen to do DIT.<br><br>My basic tool for doing DIT is an Excel spreadsheet. I have created a template with two sheets or tabs. The first sheet is my main sheet. The second sheet is my backlog sheet, to be used if necessary.<br><br>The first sheet has four sections: Will-Do, Today, Immediate, and Tomorrow. In my Excel template I have listed all my recurring daily tasks in italics. I type in each day's Will-Dos and the print it out. Anything that I add to Immediate or Tomorrow gets handwritten in. The next morning I take the previous day's list to guide me what to type in.<br><br>I use the Outlook Calendar as a kind of Task Diary. It has my scheduled appointments and it also has tasks that I want to do on days further in the future than Tomorrow. (I also have a “tickler” file which does much the same thing.)<br><br>What I have found is that, as much as possible, I like to see all my work in one place. So if there are any tasks on my daily Outlook Calendar when I do my planning, I will add that task onto my Will-Do Excel list. This Excel printout becomes my "dashboard" for the entire day. I know that Mark talks about using the task diary and folding the corners of a page in when that day's tasks are complete. I fully understand the convenience of doing that, as opposed to rewriting yesterday's undone tasks on today's Will-Do list. In the past, I used to find it incredibly draining to carry forward and rewrite the same task day after day.<br><br>But now, with DIT, I insist that I rewrite any undone task from yesterday's list. I require that I do this as another way to discourage me from leaving any undone items on my Will-Do list. Better to just do them than to rewrite them another day.<br><br>As I’ve mentioned elsewhere on this forum, for the first three weeks or so I was abusing my Tomorrow list. I actually didn’t even title it “Tomorrow,” I titled it “Future.” As I reread the book I realized what a mistake this was. My future list became a dumping ground for tasks and projects that I was resisting facing head-on. I kept recopying them day after day, carrying them forward. I was creating a debilitating and demoralizing overhanging backlog and didn’t understand what I was doing. When I finally did come to my senses, I declared my very first backlog and worked my way out of it.</div>

<div class="content">From Day 1 of my DIT implementation, I have been creating my Will-Do list in the morning. I know that this means that I am reducing the buffer between the time work arrives and the time I plan it, but this has worked for me. At some vague future time, I might try planning the evening before, but for now, I am sticking with planning in the morning. I believe that creating my plan is one of the most important things I can be doing. I am definitely a “morning person.” I like planning when I am fresh, alert, and energetic. I don’t think I am at my best at the end of the day and I don’t want to be rushing through my next day’s plan then.<br><br>In the morning, when I am planning out my list, I will go through all my e-mails (I don’t usually get a huge number of them). Any e-mail that requires action, I will write on my Will-Do list. I will open all the mail that I received the day before. Any snail mail that requires actions (even if that means further, careful reading) I will write on my Will-Do list. I avoid putting on my Will-Do list “review yesterday’s e-mail” or “review yesterday’s snail mail.”<br><br>As I go through the prior day's e-mail and papers I will, occasionally, do some things that can be done quite quickly, rather than write them on the list. I think that this violates a strict interpretation of the Closed List principle, since I am both working, and creating a list of my work, at the same time. But I feel that I have very strict limits (a kind of "two-minute" rule) and this has not presented a problem for me.<br><br>So what have I learned from these past five weeks?<br><br>First, I learned that I had been working woefully inefficiently prior to using DIT.<br><br>Second, I realized that I had a lot more work than I thought. When I was doing GTD I had huge lists of items with either no deadlines or meaningless deadlines. Most of what I do has no definite deadlines. This meant that I could easily fool myself into thinking that I had plenty of time to do other things. Now, with DIT, I understand that there are many important things that I need to be doing, and now, with DIT, I am spending my time doing them.<br><br>Third, by using DIT I have changed the way I work and I have changed the kind of person I am. I used to engage frequently in what Mark calls “displacement” activities as a means of avoiding important but resistance-inducing activities. Now, I am fully committed to completing my list every day. I still don’t want to make difficult phone calls, have difficult conversations, or write difficult analyses. But, each day I see a long list of items that I am committed to completing by the end of the day and there is no one else to do them but me. So I jump in and do them. I have become more confident and have experienced a real boost in energy. I attack my projects in a manner that has surprised me.<br><br>And I have experienced some serious successes in this short period of time. I still face many daunting challenges, but some problems that have haunted me for a very long time have been resolved. It’s not entirely due to DIT, but I give DIT a large part of the credit.<br><br>I am not the first to point out that GTD is much more about writing thoughts down than about getting things done. Now don't get me wrong. It's extraordinarily important to have a good system for writing thoughts down, and GTD provides such a system. But it does not, in itself, provide a structure that is conducive to converting those written thoughts into completed actions. And that is precisely where DIT comes in. DIT gets me from written to done.<br><br>That finishes my progress report.<br></div>

<div class="content">Now I would like to add a few comments about my choice to plan my Will-Do list the same morning instead of the prior evening.<br><br>As I understand him, Mark explains the need for a buffer by postulating that this time difference between when work shows up and when work gets done allows the rational mind to kick in and prevent the reactive mind from controlling decision-making. Mark suggests that the reactive mind is not very good at decision-making because it tends to think only about the very near-term time horizon, and decisions based on only near-term considerations tend not to advance our overall well-being as much as decisions based on long-term considerations.<br><br>So far, so good. But this suggests that it might be even better to plan in detail farther out than one day. Why not "Do It a Week from Tomorrow?" In DIWT, all of the work that comes in today is scheduled for eight days from today. What's wrong with DIWT?<br><br>I would suggest that the problem with DIWT is that between today and a week from tomorrow so much new information will arrive that it's almost a certainty that any Will-Do list that I create for a week from tomorrow will become obsolete long before a week from tomorrow arrives. It's hard to make decisions today about what to do a week from tomorrow, from an information perspective. From an information perspective, we want to make decisions as close as possible to the time that we are going to implement the decision. It's a lot easier to decide whether to have a picnic today, when our knowledge of today's weather is quite good, than it is to have made that decision eight days ago.<br><br>So, if I understand things correctly, we have two opposing considerations. On the one hand, we want to make the buffer between the time of the decision and the time of the action as large as possible to increase the likelihood that we will disable the reactive mind and advance our long-term interests. On the other hand we want to make the buffer as small as possible to maximize the information relevant to the decision.<br><br>Once again, make the buffer too small and we get tossed to and from by the shifting currents of daily randomness. Make the buffer too large and we are acting based on very stale information.<br><br>The trick is to satisfy these opposing tendencies. And that's the beauty of DIT.<br><br>I would suggest that, in fact, it does not take a very large buffer to depotentiate the reactive mind. The emotional feelings that dictate reactive decisions tend to dissipate rapidly--usually in a matter of minutes. So it has been my experience that planning in the morning has not led me to feel as if I am being any less rational than if I planned the prior evening. In fact, if anything, I feel that I am being more rational, since I am able to take into account more current information, based on e-mails and voicemails that came in overnight.</div>

<div class="content">All I do is write down everything that comes in today in a page-a-day diary for tomorrow, and then do it tomorrow.</div>

<div class="content">It seems to me like some things would HAVE to be written down today for tomorrow because that is when they come in (snailmail, email, voicemail).  For example, as a doctor, I must listen to the voice mails on an ongoing basis to screen for things that might be same day.<br><br>But then I guess that may be more specific to my profession where there may be a higher percentage of these same day items (calls in particular).<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Lena,<br><br>These would fall in the category of same-day urgent and should be done today!  As a professor of a large, NIH-funded laboratory, I too have many things that come in that turn out to be same-day urgent.  DIT certainly recognizes this, but the default as much as possible should be tasks that come in be put on tomorrow's list.<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Lena,<br><br>I wasn't sure if you were responding to my description of my methods. I agree completely with your post. In my setup I have a Tomorrow section on my spreadsheet. As I work today, I am writing in items that are coming in--thoughts, voicemail, paper, e-mail--onto tomorrow's list.<br><br>And, like Mark said, if some of those items require same-day responses I write them either under Immediate or Today.<br><br>Mark's point in the book about writing down Immediate tasks before doing them has proved useful to me. It forces me to hesitate just a bit and really ask if I need to be so reactive. My first choice is always to put it in Tomorrow. If I can't do that I will put it in Today. If I can't do that I will first put it in Immediate and then do it.<br><br>moises</div>

<div class="content">Hi moises,<br><br>Thanks for your wonderful posts on how you implement DIT.  I exclusively use Outlook 2007 for this as my entire calendar is on there (I am completely digital -- no paper).  I use the To-Do Bar for my list of actions for today.  I have it setup to sort tasks by start date and in groups.  I also have a standard task view in this way.  This works very well for me to date.  Any new task that I have to add -- same-day urgent -- goes automatically at the bottom of the list.  I add an asterisk at the beginning of the subject line and I have a rule set up such that these tasks are in italics -- clearly visible as a task at the bottom that had to be added to my closed list.<br><br>At any rate, keep up the good posts and let me know if you have any topics that we could discuss here on implementation of DIT.<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">moises, Oh now I see what you are saying.  I thought you meant you weren't dealing at all with the stuff until the morning.  So, I think we would organize similarly.  I am such the morning person.  I love the feeling with a cup of green tea and the house quiet and it's the time that I can think most clearly in any day.<br><br>But a spread sheet question:  If the stuff incoming today gets put in the 'tomorrow' column, then do you cut and past those into the 'today' column the next morning?<br><br>Lena</div>

<div class="content">One point I forgot to reply to earlier from Moises:<br><br>The primary purpose of the buffer is not to prevent the reactive mind from dominating (though it does do that), but to enable us to impose order on the random events of our working day by batching up our work so we can do it more speedily and efficiently.<br><br>If the buffer is longer than a day, the amount of work in a batch is likely to be daunting and the delay in replying to/actioning items is unacceptably long. If it's shorter than a day one is likely to jeopardise the connection between the amount of incoming work equalling the amount of outgoing work.</div>

<div class="content">Lena wrote:<br><br>But a spread sheet question: If the stuff incoming today gets put in the 'tomorrow' column, then do you cut and past those into the 'today' column the next morning?<br><br><br>My response:<br><br>My "system" is a hybrid of digital and paper. In the morning I put all my Will-Do's into my Excel template. Then I print it out. From then on, I hand-write items under Tomorrow. Or, if I do something today, I hand-write it under Today or under Immediate.<br><br>The next morning, I type in under today's Will-Do what I hand-wrote yesterday under Tomorrow.<br><br>I agree that it would be more efficient to just keep my Excel file open all day. The next morning I could do a cut and paste. But one thing that I am learning from doing DIT is that when I am dealing with relatively small lists of items, it's not a problem to enter some of them twice--by hand one day and on the keyboard the next. And that extra few seconds of re-entering gives me some time to think if it really is necessary that I do the item.</div>

Thank you very much for clarifying. I now feel more comfortable calling what I do DIT, even though I make my Will-Do list on the morning of the same day, as opposed to the evening of the prior day. By writing my Will-Do list in the morning, I still am able to benefit from all of the efficiencies of batching.</div>

<div class="content">Let’s examine simplified versions of the person who plans the night before and the person who plans the same morning.<br><br>1.	They both empty their in-box only once every 24 hours.<br>2.	They both create a Will-Do list immediately upon emptying the in-box.<br>3.	They both have neutralized the reactive mind.<br>4.	They both reap the benefits of batching.<br>5.	The night planner has a lag (15 hours?) between creating the list and commencing work on it.<br>6.	The day planner has no lag between creating the list and commencing work on it.<br><br>Is the choice of day or night planning purely a matter of personal taste, or is there some DIT principle that should nudge us one way or the other?<br></div>

<div class="meta">2008-10-23 9:46</div>
<div class="content">The DIT principle is that you don't need to plan your day at all. <br><br>You put tasks in your Task Diary as they come up. The next day you action them. The day is set up for you automatically.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Your replies are quite helpful. Thank you for taking the time to rid me of my confusions.<br><br>I now understand that, despite the fact that I was inspired by the DIT book and created my new system with the intention of implementing DIT by following all of its principles, I do not, in fact, do DIT. <br><br>At the moment, however, what I am doing is functioning fabulously and I am loathe to change something that is working so well. The benefits of my system are so apparent, and they contrast so sharply with what I had been doing prior to DIT,  that I have no motivation, at this time, to tinker with it.<br><br>I should receive your Get Everything Done book in a few days and I am looking forward to reading it for additional insights.<br><br>I would like to express my gratitude to you for formulating the DIT principles that have helped me the most: little and often, closed lists, and balancing and buffering incoming and outgoing workflow.<br><br>By implementing DIT's principles, or at least what I believe to be DIT's principles, I've enjoyed a qualitative improvement in my life. Thanks again for showing me the way.<br><br>moises</div>
