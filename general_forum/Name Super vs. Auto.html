<div class="content">While reading about SuperFocus (at the OmniFocus forum, <a href="http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=20836)," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=20836),</a> it struck me that "SuperFocus" was the natural name for the next level of "AutoFocus," but that "AutoFocus" actually is a more descriptive title.<br><br>It seems the great strength of the systems is the automatic nature of task evaluation as you go through the list.<br><br>Perhaps a thought to consider from a marketing standpoint. Maybe Super Autofocus?</div>

<div class="content">From a marketing standpoint, Mark would need to consider other product names that are already out there, and how to distinguish his system.<br><br>Use of the term "Focus" will remind some of the FranklinCovey program: << The company markets a variety of book and audio products based on Covey's 7 Habits material, as well as numerous titles by other FranklinCovey consultants. The company also offers two main training courses: one based on _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_; and another based on the original FranklinQuest time management program, now titled Focus. >> (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FranklinCovey)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FranklinCovey)</a><br><br>"AutoFocus" is descriptive, but I think it would cause confusion in the marketplace, as it is a feature built into camera lenses, as well as a class of algorithms for optimizing parameters to sharpen all kinds of imagery (e.g. radar).<br><br>I like "SuperFocus" the best.  It is descriptive, as well as competitive.  Imagine a stationery store with a display of the FC Focus planners and 7 Habits books, next to a display of the MF SuperFocus notebooks and associated guides.  Why would you choose Focus when you could buy SuperFocus instead?  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Ha! Hadn't thought about the camera version of "autofocus". Guess that's why I'm not in marketing!</div>
