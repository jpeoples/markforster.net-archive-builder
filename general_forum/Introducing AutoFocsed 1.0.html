<div class="content">Forty&Park Software is pleased to introduce AutoFocused. Built from the ground up taking Mark Forster's AFv4 time management system from paper to the screen. With innovative features such as TaskTense, StatusBoard, Pages and AutoClean, AutoFocused is a beautifully designed desktop application for those looking to be more productive. We designed AutoFocused to be efficient and beautiful, you will never need to interrupt your workflow with dialogs or popup windows as everything happens in place and directly on your task list.<br><br>TaskTense changes the grammar of complete tasks to read more naturally, making it quicker and easier to review your tasks. When tasks are marked as complete AutoFocused analyzes the tasks text and changes the grammar dynamically to reflect the task being done. For example 'Buy milk...' would become 'Bought milk...' when complete.<br><br>StatusBoard gives you a beautifully detailed progress report. As you enter StatusBoard your task list gracefully slides out of view to reveal your progress report. Check how your tasks are divided, progress of your backlog and all tasks in a second flat. When you're done watch as your task list slides right back into view ready to get to work.<br><br>Pages allows you to quickly browse even the longest of backlogs. Simply set the number of items that each page should have, and AutoFocused automatically divides your task list into pages. Use the handy Page Switcher in the toolbar to slide between pages or for quick access use keyboard shortcuts.<br><br>Other features include AutoClean, which automatically tidies up complete tasks from your list after a user definable amount of days. Also you can set the current task you're working on so if you get distracted AutoFocused is always ready to get your focus back.<br><br>Main window screenshot: <br><a href="http://fortyandpark.com/pr/images/featureZoomMain.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://fortyandpark.com/pr/images/featureZoomMain.jpg</a><br><br>StatusBoard screenshot:<br><a href="http://fortyandpark.com/pr/images/featureZoomStatus.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://fortyandpark.com/pr/images/featureZoomStatus.jpg</a><br><br>We'd love to know what you think of AutoFocused, and if you have any suggestions or criticism we would appreciate the feedback.

<div class="content">Okay, I download the trial and run it. It comes up with a cryptic message that I should not be using pirated software. So, what's the deal here?</div>

<div class="content">Sorry that you are having this issue. It seems something went wrong when the trial launched and the application believes it's been tampered with.<br><br>If you could be so kind as to send the settings file found in c:\program files (x86)\FortyandPark\AutoFocused\System\Settings.ini<br><br>and send the Settings.ini file to me at hello@fortyandpark.com you would be doing us a great service and allow us to try and identify what caused this for you and hopefully help us prevent this in the future.</div>
