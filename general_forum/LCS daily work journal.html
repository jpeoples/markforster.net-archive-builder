<div class="content">Now that I'm using an all-electronic setup (Clear.app on iPhone & Mac) for my task list and daily checklists, I don't have a durable (paper) record of what I've accomplished each day. This causes a bit of anxiety for my work life.  So I'm starting a simple page-a-day work journal that I intend to write in each evening (or next morning) for the work week, Monday through Friday.  For each day, my plan is to write about something I Learned, something I Created, and something I Shared (LCS).  Ideally, these will all be related to one another, and germane to the project(s) I'm supposed to be working on.<br><br>I'm a research engineer, so L could be a fact or algorithm or potential solution to a particular problem.  C could be a chunk of code or technical note or part of a report, proposal, presentation, etc.  S could be an email message or conversation with a colleague or manager.  I work with quite a bit of autonomy, and often fall short on the sharing part of my job.<br><br>Has anyone else tried a similar type of journaling?  If so, did it help?</div>

<div class="content">I'm taking a stab at daily journaling (w/ sketching a la Danny Gregory's The Creative License) to better understand how I handle life's challenges, particular in areas of work and creative projects. To that end, I start my day by jotting down what an "Ideal Day" would like given how my previous nights sleep, current mood, etc. Throughout the day I jot down ideas, do a sketchnote, etc., at the end of the day, I answer the following questions: 1. What did I do 2. What did I learn 3. What will I do differently tomorrow. <br><br>I've designed my pages in Illustrator, punch and stick 'em into an M Arc Circa Planner (Junior). <br><br>These days... I'm using Evernote to hold projects, tasks, etc. No formal system per se.</div>
