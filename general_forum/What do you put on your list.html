<div class="content">Q: Is it neccessary for AF and its variations to put such types of tasks on the list to keep the "flow" of the system?<br><br>- I dont know if I do right but I put everything on SFV3. I mean tasks of course but also project in the meaning of GTD and I treat them as well. There is only one exception, when i make a lot of calls I know people will call me back very soon. So I put it on a papersheet apart. But I could put it on C2 of my current page if they were very urgent or C1 at the next available page if they were not. <br><br>I also put ideas like think about this or some day do this or questions like ? do I have to do this ???? it help me to think about my aims. <br><br>Q:<br>How complete has the AFlist to be regarding upcoming tasks? Where are resonable borders? Keyword: three-fold nature of work (GTD). Do you work which shows up without putting it on the list?<br><br>Upcoming task are treated as new. ie on C1 except If they are urgent then they go on C2 of my current page. <br><br>Do the dished is not the problem I have a washing machine ! <br>Seriously, if a task has to be done on the flow i do it. I kept the GTD principle of doing things which can be treated in less than 2 mn if of course it's worth to do it, And After I go back to my SF list.</div>

<div class="content">Jen, If you're the type to rush off to a phone call and forget to do the dishes, then yes it's necessary. Otherwise not. With SuperFocus, this system pushes you hard to finish things. Therefore I find it imperative to put all manner of easy stuff on the list as well. It keeps things going when I otherwise need a break.</div>

<div class="content">@ Alan yes indeed "this system pushes you hard to finish things"  today i did 4 page without 5 and dismissed a lot. It's even tiring because the system is so persuasive that it make you do the most important things the soonest possible and it's exhausting ! its a joke of course. As Mark said put what you want to put on your list if it helps you. For myself i don't think about that the system auto-regulates what must be.</div>

<div class="content">Exhausting?  That's why breaks are on my list.</div>

<div class="content">Mark wrote:<br><<It's entirely up to you what you put on your list.>><br><br>I'm not sure if this doesn't impact the function of AF. If you do work as it shows up without putting it on the list it will influence the balance of your overall workload, right?<br><br>E.g. if I see some dust on the floor I could pick up the vaccum cleaner and start immediate the unavailing battle against dust. OR, I could put it on the list an let it "flow". <br><br>Thus, isn't it necessary to put everything on the list except emergency stuff?<br>On the other hand, I find it a bit "strange" to put common stuff on the list, which stands out naturally ...<br><br>- Jens</div>

<div class="content">The flow will vary, yes. But it's still up to you to decide. It's quite possible to have good flow without recording meals. Or anything else you already deal with adequately. Some people designate times to ignore the list and focus on something else.</div>

<div class="content">If the list is working for moving projects forward and completing tasks that otherwise build up psychological tension and cause stress when left undone, why fret over taking a break to vacuum some dust? The list is serving it's purpose.</div>

<div class="content">Jens:<br><br>What I meant by saying it's up to you what you put on your list is that you need to experiment to find what works best for you. I put those meals on the list which I eat on my own, but not the ones I eat with my wife. I put doing the dishes on the list because otherwise I forget to do them.<br><br>Those are the ways I find work best for me. But others may find it works differently for them. That's ok.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Mark. You put on your list whatever you feel should be on the list. I.e. whatever you feel you might neglect, forget or postpone otherwise. I definitely have dishes on there because otherwise they don't get done for weeks. But if dishes stand out naturally for you, then you don't need to put them on there since they will be done automatically.<br><br>One thing I do still wonder about is whether to put 'fun' stuff in there. Those items will happen whether I put them on my list or not, but putting them on the list may help me keep them at bay so that I *only* do them when they come up in my list. Unfortunately this seems to work better in theory than in practice so far...</div>

<div class="content">@Tijl<br>I am in the same case. And there is some "fun" stuf that don't seem so fun once it is written as a task.<br>For example I was interested is a historic passage of Romania and I wanted to look on wikipedia and search the net about it so I put it on the list, but once become a task it doesn't look so fun and I don't really remember why I wanted to do this research in the first place. Well, because it looked interesting but it has no direct impact on any project that I do. You would say I should dismiss it but I am sure this is interesting so I will do it, but it won't be as fun as if I had done it immediately when I had the idea.</div>
