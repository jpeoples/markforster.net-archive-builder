<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I have created a Autofocus notebook in OneNote, mail me if you want to see it, i will send you a link as this is a closed test of the system. It has the instructions and a sample setup of sections and pages.<br><br>There is also a template that you can store in your template library.</div>

<div class="content">I emailed Jon B many times and never got a reply.   Could be a ruse to collect email addresses!</div>

<div class="content">No, I don't think so. I did get a reply and download link.<br></div>

<div class="content">Why did the creator of this thread not publish his email address or a web page address to download his spreadsheet? Now all of you who published your email addresses are fair game for spammers!</div>

<div class="content">I think to be fair to Jon B that he did publish his email address at the top of the thread so that people could email him for info.  It is just that in later posts people have then added their addresses to request the info direct which is of course dependent upon the frequency of Jon's visits to the forum.<br><br>Charles makes a good point - the email address I have posted on site for people to contact me for further info on OneNote or other questions is a general address rather than my main email address which I only give out later.  If I get spammed I can change that address!</div>

<div class="content">Jon is not a spammer.  He freely provided his material for anyone who is interested.</div>

<div class="content">@Mike -<br>I don't think anyone was calling JON a spammer. Rather, people who leave their email addresses may get spammed from 'bots roaming the web looking for addresses.</div>
