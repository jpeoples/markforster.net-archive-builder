<div class="content">I have tried to work both DIT and GTD as stand alone systems and a hybrid and yet still struggle.  I like the idea of the daily task diary with a closed list as it is simple and straight forward.  Yet, having done GTD first, the idea of a projects list and a waiting list on one page each seems to make lots of sense to me.  Also, I find I need to have a notebook with me at all times and it is easier to do GTD in a notebook and have a section for notes, so everything is in one place.  <br><br>I have always tried to have the fewest number of things, as I find simpler is better.<br><br>In my world there really is no such thing as a days work there is too much variety in what I do and interuption as well as loads of things that come up during the day that need to be handles during that day. So I can not schedule alot of what comes up for tommorow.<br><br>This leads to things being carried forward or having several pages to review.  <br><br>I am not sure I yet have the answer as to how to integrate the two, as I am finding lots of good in both.<br><br>Any thoughts are appreciated.<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Dear Gerry:<br><br>First, you might find it a good idea to use a two-page to a day diary for the Task Diary. You could put the tasks on one side and notes on the opposite.<br><br>Secondly, DIT is ideal for the situation you describe - where there is a lot of variation in a day's work. In fact it is the only time management system I know of which can handle this well.<br><br>It's important to realise that "Do It Tomorrow" does not teach you to do *everything* tomorrow. <br><br>It teaches you to identify three degrees of urgency: immediate, same day, and everything else - and tells you how to deal with each.<br><br>It's highly effective in a fluid situation because it teaches that one day's incoming work has to equal one day's outgoing work *on average* - not every day. Therefore it teaches you how to identify when you have lost that balance - and what to do about it. In your sort of situation there is no other time management system I know of which allows you to do that.<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the reply.  I am still trying to get up and running.  In my instance I manage a variety of projects in the real estate field.  Many are construction projects we have financed.  I know the outcomes we are aiming for ie build the project, lease it up, then sell it.  There is lots of information I need to track that is not always a task per se.  I guess this is where I thought GTD would help, in listing all of the projects and the outcomes, then developing the next actions.<br><br><br>I understand that I would use the task diary for things like call leasing agent to get status of ABC company lease.<br><br>In DIT how do you track project related information and the overall outcomes you are aiming for. <br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Gerry<br><br>There is a lot of material on managing projects on this site, both in the articles and the discussions. I suggest you use start with the article at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/2/21/project-management.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/2/21/project-management.html</a>  and then use the Search Box to look for "Projects". Basically I make a distinction between managing a project (which is beyond the scope of a time management system) and managing yourself within the project.</div>

<div class="content">Here is what I have done, it is new but is working well so far. <br><br>I have a tabbed binder. My Task Diary is at the front, after which is my first tab, which is "Notes". After this I have tabs each for Projects, Ongoing, Future, Boss and Personal.<br><br>Behind the Projects tab I have a list of all current projects, by which I mean projects I need to move forward on as soon as I can. Behind that list I have a "projects sheet" for each project, where I capture notes and next actions. From the project list I take my "Current Initiative." I work on my current initiative each day until I cannot make any more real progress. This is usually within a week, and it occurs typically because I am depending on someone else, or I have captured and reported on everything up to that point. I also do things from the other projects, but I am not committed to doing work on them each day. I add whatever comes in today, to the next day, so have those things to work on as well.<br><br>Behind the ongoing tab I have a list of my "Continuous Projects" and behind that list is a sheet for each project to capture notes and next actions. If you haven't guessed, the same goes for "Future Projects", except that I only have an additional sheet if I need to create one to track notes. As needed at each weekly review, I am adding items to my Task Diary.<br><br>My "Boss" tab is an "agendas" section for my boss, where I record anything I have or wish to speak with her about so we can do it all in one shot. I also have there my workplan and quarterly goals and deadlines for 2008.<br><br>"Personal" is a reference tab for my family budget,etc.<br><br>I set my current initiative on a weekly basis, and I do a weekly review during which I go through all lists and project sheets.<br><br>After this I have an A-Z tab set, where I store notes of conversations with others besides my boss.<br><br>Hope that helps,<br>Gordon</div>

<div class="content">Gordon,<br><br>Thanks.  I am finding the task diary concept very useful, but realizing for me it is not the whole system.  I like what you have done and will need another "tool" to track other things and organize projects and the outcomes I desire for them.<br><br>Gerry</div>
