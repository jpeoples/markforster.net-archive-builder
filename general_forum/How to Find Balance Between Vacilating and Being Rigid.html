<div class="content">When I am working on complicated projects that require a lot of decisions to be made the following happens:<br><br>I make a decision and I continue my work based on that decision. Later, I start to doubt my original decision. This doubting causes anxiety and hampers my productivity. It also makes working on projects less fun.<br><br>I know it is not good to rigidly stick to ones decisions. It is also not good to vacillate. How does one find a balance between the two? Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">There is may be one solution. GTD. <br>The best thing may be for me to work on your project as a GTD manner end Then report AF4 action which are actionable. The physical way you manage your project for me has no matter. <br>The idea is keeping focus on things when you do it and nothing else. If you have planed your project and thought about it it will be ok. The doubt comes when your are not prepared enough or if you dont have the knowledge about things. Did this helped you ?</div>
