<div class="content">Gosh, we've only been going half a day and already we're on page 10 of the discussion forum! So we might say there's a bit of interest in the autofocus system then?!<br><br>I wanted to say that I absolutely love the "little and often" approach. I refer to it as 'Salami Slicing', because by the time you've slithered off slice after slice of the salami the whole sausage is gone before you know it!<br><br>I had a particularly grim report to write a couple of months ago and I could tell I was massively resistant to even thinking about it. As a result the task became an emotionally mammoth one. In order to get it done I took a leap of faith, sat down at my computer and put my kitchen timer on for 45 minutes. I kept going at the computer putting anything relevant on paper (computer) for 45 minutes then stopped and went and did something else. <br><br>As the days went by I was doing more and more 45 minute blocks on the report and the idea that this was a mammoth and horrible task had disappeared as soon as I'd actually started doing something about it. Always bigger in the mind than in reality!!<br><br>I'm looking forward to having a go with this system. Will need to put 'read discussion forum' on my list straight away!<br></div>

<div class="content">And you might notice that the author of Autofocus has kept completely up with the comments and his email this morning as well driving through snow and ice, getting stuck in a car park, finally giving up his journey, subscribing several people whose registrations hadn't worked, and generally remaining on top of everything without panic.<br><br>Yeehaw!</div>

<div class="content">Shelley,<br>Yes, the salami technique is a good one.  When I have a real block (for whatever reason), I slice the first time period very thinly, 5 minutes (using the kitchen timer which has never seen the kitchen) and then add 5 minutes without a break, ie 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 which means after four sessions one has done 50 minutes on the task at which pijt some hidden ertia kicks in until I finish far mor than I ever dreamed I would.<br><br>R<br></div>

<div class="content">Ha, ha! Good to hear about your experiences Roger and Mark. So the moral of this tale is that it's good to start with thin slices of the salami and before you know it you're chomping on great big wedges and enjoying every minute of it! <br><br>Oh I do like a food analogy!</div>

<div class="content">Me too!  And I'm glad I'm not the only one with a kitchen timer that hasn't seen the inside of a kitchen ........ :-)</div>
