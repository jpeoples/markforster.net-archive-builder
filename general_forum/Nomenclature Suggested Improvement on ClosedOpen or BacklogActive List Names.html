<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>This is just what I do. It's by no means necessarily what you should do.<br><br>I saw a few discussions about the names of the lists. Some people felt "Backlog" wasn't the best description and as far as "Active" goes, well, you're actually trying to work on your Backlog list first, so how does that work?<br><br>Another person felt the term "Closed" has some kind of subconscious negative suggestive effect.<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>I'm all for thinking in powerful ways.<br><br>But aside from that, the reason I chose the names I use is they're alphabetical -- I can use them as folders for my email program, in My Documents folder, or even for my browser Bookmarks.<br><br>Then I consider each of these part of my larger Autofocus system.<br><br>They're simply closed lists (in the technical sense of the term per Mark Forster) within the greater Autofocus list. Similar to individual pages on a notebook for those doing Autofocus V.1.<br><br>YOU DON'T need to use individual folders like I do (or hard copy trays), but you certainly can. You can process them exactly the same as you do your Autofocus system -- it just forms part of it.<br><br>Here are the names:<br><br>Act<br>---<br>Bide<br><br>... with a dividing line between them.<br><br>That's it: You're investing your attention first and foremost on "Act". This is your closed list, or your backlog, or whatever you want to call it. Since you're trying to clear this one up, we call it Act.<br><br>Bide means simply "bide your time"... you're not waiting forever, you're just waiting until you've run through the Act list and don't have any more tasks you're going to do at the moment.<br><br>(I'm using AF4.)<br><br>You add new items to "Bide" also because you're going to bide your time until you get to them.<br><br>So as usual you're go through "Bide" until you've gone through "Act".<br><br>These names are alphabetical and near the beginning of the alphabet so computer systems should group them near each other. This helps for my the electronic portions of my greater Autofocus list.<br><br>I just cycle through EVERYTHING "Act" -- hard copy try, email, browser toolbar, and GQueues list application (or paper list) over and over again until there are no items to do. Then I move forward to "Bide", cycling through once as before. Then back to "Act" cycling through everything repeatedly until I am not doing any more "Act" tasks.<br><br>I realize I repeated myself to make the point clear at least one of the 2 times. I hope this post was of some value to you</div>

<div class="content">I agree that good titles are nice to have.  My AF4 work lists are titled Focus and Soon.  It's a small thing but still.  Act is a good word too.  Bide, while it may be good, feels archaic.  It seems like it only has one use anymore, which is the phrase "bide your time".  So it's kind of strange to talk of a Bide List.</div>

<div class="content">how about Back-burnered? <br>Maybe too long. Just thought I'd throw it out there.</div>

<div class="content">lol<br><br>Whatever floats your boat, Beth.<br><br>I suppose in the end the names don't matter. Yet a few people seemed to have issues with the names.<br><br>I'd been using these names for a while with GTD, again for reasons of alphabetical order, and thought I'd throw it out.<br><br>Back-burnered is cute, though.</div>
