<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-12-9 15:50</div>
<div class="content">Off topic, I know. I've been using the script for months and it's wonderful, but it has recently started to fail. On the main discussion board where it lists all of the topics, none of the topics ever show as unread or new, so I'm having a hard time keeping track of which threads I've read. Also, when I open a thread, every individual comment within the thread shows as new. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn't fix it. Does anyone know how to fix it or how to get in touch with Andreas so he can help me? (I'm using Chrome, latest version.)</div>

<div class="content">I am having exactly the same problem using Firefox. I assume that there has been some change with Mark's website -- something in the code has changed. Perhaps Mark knows what might have changed? It started going wrong while he was away a couple of weeks ago.</div>

<div class="content">I heard that the new version of Greasemonkey broke some other scripts, so it could be related to that.  I haven't tried to reinstall an older version.  Right now, I am using version 0.9.1.3 which I updated 12 Nov and I have exactly the same problems described above.  <br><br>There have also been several versions of Firefox lately, so that may be contributing to the problem if it changes where and how information from Greasemonkey and its scripts can be stored.</div>

<div class="content">I installed the script in Firefox 8 and Chrome 15 on Mac OS X 10.7. No obvious errors so far. Menu shows up in left sidebar, highlighting of Mark's posts works. No posts are highlighted as new. Let's see if Chrome highlights this topic/post when I submit it in Firefox.</div>

<div class="content">Nope, no highlighting. But I do not experience all posts in a thread being highlighted as jFenter described.</div>

<div class="content">I just looked at this post:  <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1630099" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1630099</a> <br><br>Leon's post from Oct 25 was not highlighted, so apparently I had read it.  All the following posts were highlighted.  So at some time after Oct 25th the script stopped marking individual posts as read.  Previously marked posts appear to retain the marking.<br><br>Hope this helps with troubleshooting.</div>

<div class="content">Little status update: I decided to rewrite the script from scratch and take that opportunity to improve it by tracking read states for each topic instead of only one "last visit" date. Of course, I've had little time until today (Merry Christmas btw.) and I'm running into strange problems.<br><br>Currently my problem is that the dates on the overview page don't match with the dates inside a topic. Take the electric task lists topic: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1671656" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1671656</a><br><br>The last post was written 16:15, but in the overview it says the last change was 16:26. Which triggers my script to permanently flag it as unread and drives me crazy. :-)<br><br>Be that as it may, I'll soon post a link to the first version of the new script.</div>

<div class="content">The 'final' version of the user script is now available, please uninstall the old one as well as the above adventurous one if you have installed them.<br><br>Get the script from here: <a href="http://cdn.ahofmann.de/markforster.net/improvements.user.js" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://cdn.ahofmann.de/markforster.net/improvements.user.js</a><br><br>The reason why it's 'final' is that it doesn't do that much anymore. It only loads the real script and a css file directly from my server.

<div class="content">The script ignores posts older than a month. So if you install it for the first time, every topic within the last 30 day will be highlighted. You can either click through all of them once, or simply wait until they cross the time threshold.</div>

<div class="content">Hint for Chrome users: Chrome seems to download the script instead of installing it if you click on the above link. Probably a security measure since the domain names don't match. Just copy the link and paste it into the location bar and it will prompt you to install it. I'll update my script download page to amend this issue.</div>

<div class="content">Hugo: <br><br>Should be fixed, no reinstall needed.<br><br>Dave:<br><br>IE doesn't support userscripts (as far as I know). Supported browsers are Firefox with GreaseMonkey, Chrome without an extension or NinjaKit and Safari with NinjaKit. Other GreaseMonkey-compatible extensions may exist, Opera will probably work.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br>Hugo Ferreira:<br><br>I'm also using Firefox 9.0.1 and Greasemonkey 0.9.13, but having trouble with the script highlighting new posts. As Hugo said, works fine in the main forum page, but is not highlighting the individual posts in each topic. Scrolling to the first unread post is working fine.<br><br>Any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">Hugo:<br><br>Unfortunately, no. Clearing the cache resets the script but doesn't change its behaviour and restarting doesn't change anything either. No-one else seems to be having a problem, so I'm beginning to suspect the problem lies with my Firefox install -- which has been acting a bit buggy of late. Maybe time for a re-install.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for the suggestions. In any case, the script still does what it needs to do, so I can live with the loss of individual post highlighting!<br><br>By the way, Mark: congratulations on the new look. Very classy!</div>

<div class="content">At first, the individual comments weren't being highlighted for me, either, in Chrome. All I did to fix it was to uncheck the "Highlight New Posts" option then check it again. The next discussion thread I viewed had the highlighting. I also noticed that the new "High Contrast" option didn't show up until then, either. My guess is that doing something that specifically set an option made the script reload all of the options and apply then as it should.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Andreas! Long time user of your script! I think the new version is not working for me when a forum topic has more than one page. When I go to page 2, everything is highlighted, all the time. Is it a hiccup in my installation? I use Chrome and <a href="http://cdn.ahofmann.de/markforster.net/improvements.user.js" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://cdn.ahofmann.de/markforster.net/improvements.user.js</a> -- thanks!</div>

<div class="content">I've noticed that too.  I'm also using Chrome.<br>Mark had been limiting a topic to 50 posts but now several have surpassed that number and in the process a possible bug in the user script has been revealed.  I'm going to uncheck and recheck the boxes in the lower right hand margin to see if that does the trick.<br><br>This did not fix it; all previously read posts on second pages are still highlighted as unread.</div>
