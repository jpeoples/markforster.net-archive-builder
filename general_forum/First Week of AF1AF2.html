<div class="content">I've now been working the AF1/2 switch for a week now. So here are the stats showing how many tasks remain unactioned on each page of my list (34 tasks to a page):<br><br>Page 1: 0<br>Page 2: 0<br>Page 3: 0<br>Page 4: 0<br>Page 5: 5<br>Page 6: 2<br>Page 7: 2<br>Page 8: 5<br>Page 9: 1<br>Page 10: 5<br>Page 11: 7<br>Page 12: 7<br>Page 13: 13<br>Page 14: 10<br>Page 11: 21<br>Page 12: 15<br>Page 13: 7 (out of 10)<br><br>The first 148 tasks on the list have all been actioned.<br><br>No tasks have been dismissed yet.<br><br>A total of 418 tasks have been put on the list during the week, of which 318 have been completed. This gives a completion rate of 45.4 tasks per day. Assuming this rate is maintained, there are 2.2 days' worth of uncompleted tasks remaining on the list.<br><br>I actually find it difficult to imagine how these statistics could be bettered.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Out of curiosity I checked back on my statistics since starting AF2, i.e. 1 July.  I have entered 293 tasks in that tiime and only 27 remain which is a massive completion rate of 91%.  Add into that the fact that 4 of those 27 tasks have been added today and the fact that my dismissal line hasn't even approached these tasks!  Pretty amazing!! Especially as I haven't been able to spend anywhere near the amount of time that I did at the beginning of AF1 ...........  Great system Mark - as ever!!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>But don't forget that I started with my old list - at the start I had 362 items, which is now down to 173, so in addition to clearing the 266 "new" tasks I also cleared 216 "old" tasks.  That'll do for me! :-)</div>
