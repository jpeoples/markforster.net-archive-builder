<div class="content">"Once you’ve finished with the last page, re-start at the first page that is still active."<br><br>I am not too clear about this sentence.<br><br>I thought we cross out all (and hightlight using marker) the things that don't stand out as we move to the next page already, so what does it mean to go back to the first page that is still active?</div>

<div class="content">Kevin, you only highlight and dismiss items on a page that have nothing that stands out on the FIRST pass through. In other words, you read your list of 32 tasks. You keep going over and over it and end up doing 6 of the tasks until nothing stands out. You DON'T dismiss the remaining items. You move on to the next page. When you get back to this original page of 26 remaining items and you find more things you want to do, continue on as before. BUT if you look at those 26 remaining items and see nothing the first time you look at the page (on this your second round through it), THEN you'd dismiss the remaining items. Typically, you will only have a few items left on the page after multiple passes and days doing tasks from that page when you dismiss. Pages that have dismissed items are inactive. Start with the first page that has active tasks. Hope that is clear.</div>
