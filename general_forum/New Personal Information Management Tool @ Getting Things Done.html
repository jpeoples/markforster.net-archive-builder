<div class="content">Looks like EverNote.  Am I right?  Or does it have some more focused tools specifically for time management?</div>

<div class="content">Max - it ain't pretty. Also, it seems to do what a gazillion other note/task management software seems to do. Or am I missing something?</div>

<div class="content">Alan, <br><br>Actually Information Management Tool is different from EverNote. It is primarily used for taking and storing notes in a rigid structure. BUT while working with Information Management Tool there are NO limits:<br>- you can create unlimited amount of notes, subnotes, trees, etc.<br>- add almost any types if information (notes, wiki-notes, to-do lists, projects, web hyperlinks) to your own database<br>- reorganize all data as need, drag and drop notes, link them together, share notes between projects, etc.<br><br>In other words in Information Management Tool you will easily create a personal information NETWORK, where all your notes, projects, wiki-documents, web-pages are created and organized, linked together in one database.</div>

<div class="content">Sounds like the capture features of Evernote 3 with the management features of EverNote 2.2 with a few other things thrown in.</div>

<div class="content">And no free trial period either. <br><br>So, Max, why would I want to invest as much money as that in a system which doesn't appear to do anything which isn't already done by many other programs, especially when I don't have an opportunity to try it out first?<br><br>I think you are going to need to point out the key advantages of your program over other similar programs much more clearly, and give something like a 30-day free-trial period.</div>
