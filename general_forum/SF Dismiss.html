<div class="content">Hi all, I am still struggling with dismiss. So I thought we could exchange with the help of Mark about this fundamental rule and may be you could correct me if I do or understood something wrong. <br><br>First let's definit what dismiss mean. If I rightly understood it, it is a task or a project which is no longer ACTIVE but SUBJECT TO REVIEW. Then it could be a task or a project I may do in the near future.<br><br>I chose to put everything in my SF list ie Project's name, waiting at a very short time example a message to a customer to call me back, a choice example Do I have to do this or that ? , an intention example To rightly use SF do this first<br><br>When I read my SF list I often dismiss. It often happen after 5 ou 6 pass. Then I high line the task and I write in my SF list review dismissed tasks. <br><br>It also happen that the all column one is dismiss. This is because nothing stood at me during the reading of the column one. <br><br>Then the question is about the treatment of the dismissed tasks<br>If I need to work on the task for a long time (example a project) I plan it in my diary like an appointment. If it is no longer available it is crossed, if I still dont know if I do it or no it goes in omnifocus as a someday me be action or project list. If i know it may become operational very soon I let it in sF. <br><br>Do I do right ? <br>Did I understood rightly the rules ? <br>How do you dismiss yourself ? <br>After how long ? <br><br>Jupiter.</div>

What this means is that there cannot be dismissed tasks on a page that is still active.</div>

<div class="content">I am guilty of putting an "x" in front of an individual task, deciding that I no longer wish to do it, while keeping the page active. <br><br>If I really wanted to engage in logical contortions, I could rationalize my behavior by stating that I am doing something on the task by writing the "x".</div>

<div class="content">moises,<br><br>I may be wrong, but I believe what you are doing with the "x" is task deletion, not dismissal, and is within the official rules for SF.  Personally I append "NOT" to the task description before crossing it out instead of putting an X in front, to remind me that I chose to delete it.<br><br>Dismissal is for tasks remaining, that you didn't take action on or delete. Unlike deletion, dismissal is to be done for all remaining (C1) tasks, when you visit the page and find nothing you want to do.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark "According to the current rules for SuperFocus, it is always the entire page that is dismissed not individual tasks. What this means is that there cannot be dismissed tasks on a page that is still active" Many thanks this point.I am going to correct this reading again this rule. <br><br>But there are still some ambigues tasks. Usually If reading a task I decide it is no longuer available I cross it immediately. I guess it right according to the rules. But for some of them I don't know what to do even after several passes. So I may do like Ubi Not in front of the tasks I am ready to delete but not yet. But then how to treat them if there are not crossed when I will dismiss the all page ? <br><br>NB this happen because I almost put everything on my SF list. Anything i really want to do and choice to decide example : "To conquest new custumer do I have to do this, or that ? " <br><br>But Thoughts, comments about projects always goes into the project file if there is one.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter:<br><br>Well, that's exactly what dismissal is for - ambiguous tasks which you haven't either done or decided definitely not to do.<br><br>Simply follow the dismissal rules of whichever system you are using.</div>
