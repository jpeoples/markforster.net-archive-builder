<div class="content">Something I've been fancying with for some time is a special kind of notebook that some German coaches recommend which they call a "Superbuch", literally translated as "super book". <br>That's a hard-bound note book (any kind will do) where you write *everything* (except, maybe, long journal entries, and it does not serve as your calendar). There you collect your tasks, notes from telephone calls, and a lot of other stuff. There are no pre-written dates, and you either append a new day's notes where you finished the day before, or you start a new page every day. But a day's notes might fill more than one page.<br><br>The nice thing is to have everything in one place, and you're not restricted in how much space a day will get. <br>The obvious downside to this is that it is bound to become a mess quickly. You have to actively maintain and regularly prune it. Even then, it's a little hard to identify all your tasks (colour-coding might help a little).  <br>Some people love those books, others hate them.<br><br>The special reason why I'm posting this here is that I don't see a way to combine this note book with DIT. There is no "tomorrow" to put the new work that's coming in during the course of a day. There are no future dates to put reminders or future tasks that cannot be done earlier. <br><br>Any ideas for workarounds?<br><br>Side note: A conventional ring-binder style planner in 2-page-a-day format (with a blank page for notes every day) would come close, but (a) I heavily dislike the rings when writing on the left page, and (b) you can hardly find that kind of page layout here in Germany, all manufacturers that offer 2-page-a-day insist on putting "late meetings" (Time/system), to-dos (Filofax) or other stuff on the second page, no real blank pages for notes. And (c) they're generally bulky and huge. So they're out.</div>

<div class="content">You could keep tomorrow's "work" on a separate piece of paper and then when today is finished write it in  the last blank page.  Of course this does not solve the problem of future dates for reminders in the future, although you could just insert a notecard or blank piece of paper with these keeping them all in one place.  <br><br>This is not a unique issue, I too struggled with where to  put notes, project lists etc.  In GTD projects are all on lists you keep.  After using DIT, what I find is that Mark's advise of putting notes in an in tray and then writing the tasks that come from the notes in the task diary is the way to go, I then file the notes in a file for the project. I keep all of my notes related to a project in a clip in the file, which allows me to see the progress being made instead of having them on random pages in a book which is hard to sort through when you need access to them.  I do have a spiral notebook which has project related thoughts such as reminders of key issues, that are not date specific, or are out further than the current task diary.  There is no reason I could not file these in the separate project files and create a task to review them say monthly to make sure the projects are on track.<br><br>For me the task diary containing just tasks and future reminders makes it cleaner for me. <br><br>Good luck.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry, thanks for your reply. <br><br>It made me think again about a personalized combination of paper and electronic tools, which is something I've been playing around for a while, but never found a good toolset. This might be a good starting point, and it could also solve the reminders issue. So the "super book" could be both the daily plan for attack (closed list) and the capture device, and nothing could stop you from using it as a mindmapping/general note taking instrument as well.<br><br>"what I find is that Mark's advise of putting notes in an in tray and then writing the tasks that come from the notes in the task diary is the way to go," <br>Where did you find that? If it's in the book, I must have missed it.<br><br>"For me the task diary containing just tasks and future reminders makes it cleaner for me. " <br>This is something I'll probably have to think through a little bit more, sounds quite reasonable.</div>

<div class="content">Why not have two note books: one super book and one task diary? <br><br>The task diary would serve as described in DIT. And the super book could be used for capturing your tasks, ideas, projects, etc.<br></div>

<div class="content">There was a post a few years back on MarkTAW.com called "Cascading Next Actions" which outlined a method which I think would work well for the superbuch approach. If you Google it you should find a few links. <br><br>Basically it amounts to marking every action you need to take as you collect your notes (put a box beside the entry or some other preferred symol) and once you check it off, listing the "next action" farther down the page (wherever their is space). You phrase the action in such as way as to keep the project "in mind".<br><br>HTH<br>Gordon</div>

<div class="content">Dear Alex<br><br>I used one of these books for years (though I called it a "logbook" rather than a super book).<br><br>The main idea behind it is that it is frequently easier to find things by the date they were entered than by the subject matter. <br><br>I ceased to use it when the main means of communicating with me became email rather than telephone.<br><br>There is no reason why this type of book shouldn't be used with DIT, but I don't think it would be a good idea to try to combine it with the Task Diary. In other words it would be additional to the Task Diary, not instead of it.<br><br>I used an ordinary large hard-cover notebook and wrote in the date before the first note for each day. I didn't start a new page for each day. I ticked off each entry once any action needed had been taken, ticked the top of the page if all items had been actioned on it, and put a double tick if there were no unactioned items on earlier pages.<br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>Mark</div>

<div class="content">Mark, thank you very much for your answer and your interesting description how you used this kind of notebook. <br><br>I'm afraid that using two separate notebooks (logbook and task diary) would complicate things rather than improve my  work. But using the logbook as the task diary at the same time seems impossible. Your reply, others' comments and my own thinking all indicate this.<br><br>So it's probably better to forget the whole "super book" idea and use something smaller as a dedicated capture device.</div>

<div class="content">Alex et al.<br><br>You may be interested in a product called The Daybook (www.qapublishing.com.au).  It has some nice features including summary pages that allow you to relist (if you choose) unresolved actions.  <br><br>I was surprised how simple but powerful it was for tracking tasks and can easily be adapted as a DIT task diary.  I don't have any involvement with the co. other than living in Oz.<br><br>Jack</div>

<div class="content">I posted a reply to Jack's post about the "Daybook" which was similar to Mark's reply. In addition, I wanted to point out that a standard notebook gives you the possibility to *schedule* a review instead of following fixed page quotas until having to review.<br><br>Unfortunately, my post didn't show up or was deleted. <br><br>Mark, is there a policy not to allow links to threads of 'competing' forums? <br>If so, it would be good if you publish that policy.

<div class="content">Oops, my mistake: When I returned home, I noticed that my former post seemingly got stuck at the preview stage. So here's my post that should have showed up earlier: <br><br>---<br><br>The Daybook has been discussed extensively in this thread in the "official" GTD forum: <br><a href="http://www.davidco.com/forum/showthread.php?t=8210" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidco.com/forum/showthread.php?t=8210</a> <br><br>It's basically a regular notebook with one or two (I'm not sure about that) yellow pages bound into the book after each 14 white pages. The yellow pages are for reviewing (and collecting) your outstanding (undone) actions. <br><br>While this could be a nice refinement of the superbook/logbook principle, one can easily use any regular notebook that way. Maybe even better to schedule the review in your calendar instead of doing it just because you reached a fixed yellow page. <br><br>But this method certainly isn't DIT, and I don't see how the Daybook is going to help with the superbook/logbook's deficiency for scheduling like a task diary.<br><br>For everybody who understands German, there is also some discussion of the Daybook in this "superbook" thread: <a href="http://www.gtd-forum.de/thread.php?threadid=290" rel="nofollow">http://www.gtd-forum.de/thread.php?threadid=290</a><br><br>---<br><br>BTW: It looks like there is a new spam protection (captcha) layer in place which is the reason why I failed to post this.</div>

<div class="content">Alex,<br><br>Since two notebooks would be complicated to carry around, how about using something like a reporter's notebook (bound on top) beginning at one side (say the front) for the task diary and the other side (maybe the back) for the log book?  You could decorate or color code the front and back covers for easy identification.<br><br>This is my first post here.  Thanks for the informative forum.</div>

<div class="meta">2008-07-15 23:08</div>
<div class="content">Along the lines of Lenore's post.  How about a 2 subject notebook.  One section for notes and the other section you date by hand and make a task diary.  Alternatively if you like one book.  Why not just put a book mark in the middle and again date one half for a task diary and use the other half for a notebook that you date as you go along.</div>

<div class="content">Since using a hardbound book to capture *everything* is one of my own unhealthy obsessions, I'm posting here a link to my delicious bookmarks tagged as "superbook": <a href="http://del.icio.us/brownstudy/superbook." rel="nofollow">http://del.icio.us/brownstudy/superbook.</a> You'll note related tags for 'analog' and 'notebook' that would link out to other discussions and systems.<br><br>There was a long thread on the 43Folders forum on the 'superbook' topic, and it had lots of great links to German sites and other pages; I don't believe you need to be a member of the forum for the link to work.<br><br>That said, I'm still using my Mead At-a-Glance 2008 Page a Day diary for my DIT system, 3rd year in a row, and it's still the best, most natural tool for me.</div>

<div class="content">Lenore & Gerry,  <br>the idea of using a notebook from both sides is a good one, but I doubt it's very useful if one of the two uses is a diary. I'd have to date the pages in advance (which is the only way to solve the initial problem), and at some point it will cut into the space used for the logbook. You'll essentially get the same result if you use tabs as dividers. However, dating all the pages in advance is a little too cumbersome for my taste, and it defeats some of the flexibility of the "superbook". Among "Moleskine hacking" GTD advocates, however, a division of notebooks with tabs is pretty common (used there mostly for separating the "inbox" - which resembles the "superbook", although the processing is meant to be different - from context and project lists). Usually it doesn't involve a diary part, however.<br>One additional problem I see if you use half of a notebook as a task diary with, say, one page per day is that you'll get only three months of diary (ca. 90 pages) out of one notebook. Scheduling items will become a problem when the three months run out. Where to put the later items? Carry another notebook? This would be necessary for about 1/3 of the time, if you want to be able to schedule at least 1 month in advance, which sounds reasonable.<br><br>Mike, <br>thanks for reminding me of that 43F forum thread. Actually, I started it, back when I still believed in GTD ;-) <br>(BTW: Funny how we keep running into each other on different sites, like DC, 43F and here.) <br>When I follow your del.icio.us link, I get "no items", although there is a tag by that name, and if you click on the tag, you get 12 links.<br><br>P.S.: I don't quite understand why this spam protection captcha comes up sometimes, but not always.</div>

<div class="content">Actually, I was thinking of another variation, which is a combination of paper and electronic solutions. <br><br>A large part of the appeal of paper is that it makes capture much easier and more flexible (e.g. writing across a two-page spread, markups, highlighting, sketches, diagrams, mindmaps). Another advantage is that it 'feels' more 'obligatory' in contrast to digital solutions which I find easier to dismiss. <br>A disadvantage of the 'superbook' is that it gets messy rather quickly. <br>Another aspect is that I'm determined to keep my address book digital and I'm inclined to do the same with my calendar (think: alarms, recurring appointments). So I'll have a hybrid system anyway. <br><br>So I'm pondering using paper in the 'superbook' variant for capture and journaling, cleaning it up regularly (daily, I hope) by entering all 'to-do' items into Outlook (where they can be separated into real commitments and 'Someday/Maybes', in GTD parlance, and real commitments can be scheduled for tomorrow or any other future date). <br>From Outlook I could create a 'daily plan of attack' (on paper), which considers both the scheduled appointments for the day (which are usually very few in my case) and the 'task diary' type tasks for the day. <br><br>To sum it up, Outlook would serve as the 'middle man' for pooling and scheduling all tasks. In the 'not-so-super-book', I'd start a new page every day with an overview of scheduled appointments for that day, my closed list (the clear disadvantage is that I'll have to rewrite it every day) and enough space to capture 'below-the-line' items beneath the closed list. This would be followed by the superbook/journaling entries of the same day. <br><br>This also gives me the opportunity to more clearly separate work and personal tasks/lists, which is something that I really want to do. I'm not an executive, small business owner or self-employed person, and I don't feel like carrying around the paper weight (not sure that this expression doesn't backfire) of my work tasks in my personal life. Most time management systems tend to fall short in this respect, and DIT, unfortunately, is no exception. <br>I know very well that it is the mantra of all time management literature I know of not to do that, but I really don't feel like carrying aroung a huge binder or whatever in my spare time. With an electronic solution that syncs to a PDA, I don't care. Syncing my personal to-dos to my company's computer is another matter entirely, but that's not inside the subject of this thread.</div>

<div class="content">Alex! Ashamed to say I didn't recognize your handle, sorry.<br><br>Sorry if the delicious link was busted. I had 11 or 12 links under superbook tag, so maybe that's an absolutely unique tag.<br><br>I hesitate to mention this, but have you thought about the Levenger Circa system? Similar to something called Rollabind. Google "levenger circa" and be amazed at the number of sites and links. Anyway, maybe your "superbook" could be a Circa, which is customizable, can grow or shrink as you like, and you're not locked into a bound set of pages.<br><br>There's something in our left-brain design minds that likes the tidiness of a single bound volume, but unless you keep it simple, your imagination will start complicating the solution to account for all categories of info, including exceptions to the rules you've already set up. That's why Mark's DIT and the diary I use work so well for me. <br><br>Contact me off the forum if you'd like any more detailed info on how I use my planner book. I posted some scans of my pages to one of the Yahoo analog planner groups.<br><br>meb</div>

<div class="content">Here's what works for me: I carry an A5 spiral-bound notebook wherever I go.   They are freely available in any stationery store, so one is not locked into any expensive proprietary system.  A5 is a European paper size.  US paper sizes include one close to it which I would use if I lived in that country.<br><br>Each book lasts me about three weeks.  I use the front for notes.  The back is my task diary.  When I start a new book, I head the back pages with the dates of the days coming in the next 3 or 4 weeks or so; it only takes a couple of minutes.  You really don't need to spend money to have pages neatly preprinted with dates when you can hand write them yourself.<br><br>Of course, there are things one might wish to schedule at a moment beyond the 3-4 week period.  That's particularly true as you near the end of the 3-4 weeks.   Those tasks I capture on the very last page, headed "To next book", and transcribe when the next book gets started.<br><br>The notes at the front are made in chronological order, and cover every subject, in the way that others have described.  I number and keep all the books.  When clients or counterparties have raised disputes over some matter in the past, the realisation that I can produce contemporaneous notes is normally enough to make them back down.<br><br>This scheme has a number of advantages.<br><br>1	There's only one book to carry around.  (MonkeyMind asks "Why not have two note books: one super book and one task diary?".  Alex W replies "I'm afraid that using two separate notebooks (logbook and task diary) would complicate things rather than improve my work."  I agree with Alex W, and ask "Why not recognise that one book has two ends?")<br><br>2	There's no choice to be made about which book to write in on a particular topic, as there would be if one had separate notebooks for different subjects.<br><br>3	There's no danger of having forgotten to bring the relevant book, as there would be if one had separate notebooks for different subjects.<br><br>4	There's no choice to be made about where to look for notes written in the past on a particular topic, as there would be if one had separate notebooks for different subjects.<br><br>5	Flipping between the task diary and the notebook is a matter of turning pages rather than pushing one book away and putting another in front of you.  Some Post-it tabs or similar can make it easy to get directly between the current pages.<br><br>6	(For me, most important, and the objection to any ring binder system:) The spiral binding allows the book to be folded right back, so that it it presents a small A5-sized space for writing in a confined space, such as a bus or train.<br><br>7	If you want a larger page to draw on, opening the book to present two opposing pages gives you a surface the size of A4.  Admittedly, it has the spiral down the middle, so it's not as nice as a single sheet that size; but the spiral is smaller than any ring binding or similar system.  (Alex W mentions "writing across a two-page spread".<br><br>8	The pages are not punched or perforated, so there's no danger of them falling out as there is in a system such as Levenger Circa.  (Some notebooks have pages pre-perforated to make them easier to tear out neatly; that's an embellishment I actively don't want.)<br><br>The main drawback is that there's a small amount of housekeeping to be done when one switches from one book to the next.  But that's not without disadvantages in terms of decluttering.  I sometimes describe this arrangement as "my self-emptying filofax."<br><br></div>

<div class="content">> Imagine you have to go back a couple of years to an idea you had, what process would you go through?<br><br>If I knew roughly when the idea came, I could find it fairly quickly, as the books and the pages in them are in chronological order.<br><br>But sometimes you don't know the date, or remember it wrongly.  That results in a lot of time consuming searching.<br><br>In practice I find this happens no more than a couple of times a year.  For this reason, I think one should optimise one's system for writing rather than reading: for getting information into it, without any overhead in the form of indexing or such like, even if that makes subsequent retrieval harder.  <br><br>The computer systems we use in the office are based on the same principle: present no barrier to getting the information recorded while it is fresh in the mind, even at the expense of immaculate structuring.</div>

<div class="content">I tinkered with the idea of combining a notebook and calendar for advance planning for quite a while, and found a solution that works for me. Maybe it'll work for you too.<br><br>I use an ordinary yellow legal pad (not the glue top kind, but the kind that you can flip and tear sheets out of). Then I put separate Weekly calendar sheets in the back of the pad, between the cardboard back and the last page of the notebook. These sheets are for advance planning and DIT. Each day has plenty of room for scheduled Appointments, To Do's, and Reminders. I also have columns for Calls to Return and Items To Do/Reminders for the week.<br><br>I make the calendar sheets myself in Microsoft Word, and print them on regular sized paper (portrait, not landscape, so I can flip the legal pad pages up quickly on the fly to read and write). <br><br>I number the pages of the legal pad 1-50 for reference purposes. The first 3 pages are an "index". The rest are for notes and Daily Agenda/Task Diary. <br><br>I like to have everything for the day on one page. Each morning, I draw a vertical line down the middle of the first blank page in the pad: "Things To Do" go on the right side, (I draw a line under my Closed List). "Appointments" go on the upper half of the left side, "People To Call" go on the bottom half of the left side.<br><br>Items for the Daily Page come from checking unfinished items from the previous day's page and the DIT notes on the weekly calendar page in the back. I put a checkmark by everything on these sources to make sure I haven't missed anything. I also check my Notes pages from the previous day: any tasks that come up from my notes are marked w/a circle on the left margin to make them stand out while I'm taking notes. (They should've been processed to the appropriate day on the weekly page, but sometimes life happens...)<br><br>The notebook pages immediately following the Daily Page are for meeting notes, phone log, etc. <br><br>The beauty of my system for me is that I may use 1 page for notes today, I may use 10; doesn't matter. I work through my Daily Page, crossing items off, adding new ones below the line if necessary or putting them on the appropriate day of the Weekly calendar page. Tomorrow I'll go to the next blank page in the pad, and make a new Daily Page.<br><br>During the day, if I complete a task and take notes on it, I check off the item as done on the Daily Page and put the appropriate page number behind it so I can easily find the notes if I need them. I never remove any notes or Daily Pages from the pad. If I need the notes for a project or client, I xerox the page and drop it into the appropriate file. I seriously keep my old legal pads under lock and key.<br><br>My system is pretty flexible, cheap, and easy to maintain. A pad may last 2 weeks, or 3 days, depending on what I'm doing. (I'm a Financial Advisor, so I have days when I have a lot of meetings, others that are taken up by phone calls or research.) I keep about 2 months (8 pages) of weekly sheets in the back of the pad, and one monthly sheet for the month following those (I don't usually schedule myself out more than 3 months at a time). When a pad is full, I put the weekly calendar sheets in a new pad. No re-writing.<br><br>Legal pads are cheap and available anywhere. The weekly sheet I made is undated, so I xerox as many as I want and fill the dates in myself...takes 2 minutes for 2 months' worth of calendar pages. It takes about one minute to number the notebook pages 1-50.The component that takes longest to maintain is the index sheets at the front. I do these after the pad is full so I can go back and refresh myself on anything important. This is usually a 5-10 minute process.<br><br>Like I said, this works for me. Maybe you'll be able to glean something from my system that will work for yours.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you all for your answers. <br>Right now, I don't have the time at hand ro reply thoroughly. <br><br>Mike, Levenger/Rollabind products are nearly impossible to come by here in Europe. There's something similar from Belgium called Atoma. However, their range of products is rather small,and the only hole punch you can buy is horribly expensive (ca. 100 EUR/150 US$). Plus, from what I've seen, it's not suitable for pocket-friendly sizes (only A4/A5).</div>

<div class="content">Pascal,<br><br>It's 11 3/4" by 8 1/2". I also keep some index cards with me, or a small (3x5) composition book for notes, but the legal pad is pretty unobtrusive in most places because it's so common. I can keep it with me wherever I usually need it (home, office, and meetings). On the odd times I don't have it, I make sure to transfer my notes from the index cards or small notebook to the pad.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Jeff, I thought it was that "big" size (close to ~A4, in European format).<br><br>I think your system is very well thought (quite close to what I use currently, but in your system, with an extra touch on dividing page in 4 areas which is a very good idea plus the idea to put your notes after the daily diary, which is beautiful by its simplicity: I wish I thought it before you!).<br><br>The size annoys me, as no really practical when I travel -a lot for Businesses' trips - or during 'non business' periods.<br>I have tried A5, half the size, but then I have problem in writing "readabily" (as my writing is not readable at that level of 'manual font'!).<br><br>Nevertheless, thanks again.<br>Pascal<br></div>

<div class="content">David C<br><br><<For this reason, I think one should optimise one's system for writing rather than reading: for getting information into it, without any overhead in the form of indexing or such like, even if that makes subsequent retrieval harder.<br><br><<The computer systems we use in the office are based on the same principle: present no barrier to getting the information recorded while it is fresh in the mind, even at the expense of immaculate structuring.>><br><br>This is a good point. Programs like Evernote (really a computerised version of the sort of notebook you are using) are great for bunging stuff in, then sticking on few tags when you can be bothered to, and relying on the program's extremely efficient search facility to get stuff back out again.<br><br>The same principle underlies programs like the Nelson Email Organiser (without which I could not live) and Google Desktop.<br><br>Stuff which you use all the time, you simply get to know the quickest way to bring it up and it takes no time to find.

<div class="content">Alex, I am doing what you proposed in your middle post, a combination of paper and electronic.  So far, I find this the best route.  <br><br>I use a Moleskine cahier book (which is thin) to record the major appointments for the day, task diary and journal/collection instrument.   It is quite small but has a big enough pouch in the back that I use it as a wallet (cards, receipts, money bills) and it goes every where with me (along with my PDA). <br><br> I have also just printed on to 3x5 cards my daily tasks from outlook and then just stick it in my Moleskine.  This saves having to write down but it is an extra something that can fall out of the Moleskine if you aren't careful.  <br><br>Anyway, how are things going with your new system?</div>

<div class="content">I love this topic and wanted to contribute what works for me.  I also use the Moleskin cashier.  It's the perfect size, with no spirals, disks or rings to make it snag on a pocket or in a bag.  I have a pen on the page I'm on as the page marker.<br><br>How I integrate the closed list is with one post it (3x3) for each day.  At the top of the post it I put very clearly the day and date - like this: Wednesday September 3rd, 9/3/08.<br><br>This reminds me all day of the date.  And I don't have any brain injury or disorder, but when I'm super busy I can actually forget.<br><br>Under the date I draw a line and then have a section for appointments for the day.<br><br>Below that is the to do/closed list for the day.  And I find if all this doesn't fit on a 3x3 post it, it's too much for one day anyway and I have to face that.  The advantage is that the post it is always on the page I'm on in the book, also where my pen is and also where the blank page for note taking is .<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">I have used the "superbook" idea for many years and I have loads of them. I prefer to call them "thoughtdump" notebooks because there is no organisaiton of the information in them, all the ideas, diagrams, lists etc are all put in as and when I think of them. I only occassionally put the date at the top of the page. I love going back through them occasionally and seeing what progress I have made or picking out ideas I haven't yet developed. I did try once using a notebook split into 3 with tabs - one for ideas, one for task diary and one for a  journal. This was the least successful of the thoughtdumps because of having to consciously organise the data in it - for example would a journal entry be just in the journal or if it contained ideas should it be in the ideas section too? I also found one of the sections produced a lot more pages than the others and it was the kind of notebook where I couldn't move the tabbed page that separated the categories. Anyway, in the end I went back to the good old fashioned typist or legal wire bound pad and carried on as before. I make sure I get good quality ones (they are still cheap though) because if the paper is too poor quality and I put post-it notes on them the glue from the post-its can tear the pages after a while. <br>If I do write some thing "journally" in it I go through it occassionally and tear those pages out and clip them into my "proper journal" which I keep separately now.<br>This all works wonderfully well apart from one disadvantage - it's hard to search through these note books to find stuff and link it together. I have over 20 or so of these notebooks and if they were in electronic format they would be so much easier to search through. I am thinking about getting a small tablet pc to use as an equivalent so I can write, draw and capture ideas and still be able to search them and link them together. I am hoping that the electronic nature of a tablet pc will be close enough to using a notebook and pencil for me to like using it. I never bother writing down tasks to do on certain dates (I dislike diaries) but put them in my phone because I can set an electronic reminder on it which is impossible in a paper notebook. This is good because having the "bleep" means I don't keep having to refer to it. Well, it works for me.</div>
