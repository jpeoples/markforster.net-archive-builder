<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>As we all wait with anticipation for your new addendum/supplement for DIT -- DIT2, if you will, a central question has come to my mind.  Many people have found Autofocus (and for me, AF4) to be an outstanding system.  I have heard some say that they will be very hesitant to abandon AF4 and go to a DIT system.  I must say, although there are aspects of DIT that I do miss, I have found AF4 to be a wonderful system.   WIth your new system, are you abandoning AF4 and focusing now back to DIT and your new add-on?  Or will you actively promote both systems?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>I think you asked me exactly the same question about a year ago about whether I was abandoning DIT for AF. And my answer is exactly the same: the fact that I have introduced/amended one system doesn't mean that anyone has to follow that system and abandon something that was working fine for them. I would also continue to support all previous systems.<br><br>As for promoting systems, I haven't really done any promoting of any system outside this forum. This forum simply reflects the concerns of its posters.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>I'm also curious if you evolve from system to system, or choose depending on your mood. David Seah, another productivity writer, creates tons of productivity content, but has told me he no longer uses most of it. He's constantly searching, and developing, material/systems to match his temperament. Lately, he's been using AF4. <br><br>I often wonder if switching systems is a form of procrastination or a healthy approach to keeping things fresh. Thoughts anyone?</div>

<div class="content">Well, in my case, switching systems used to be a form of procrastination. But I also get a kind of motivation from a new, shiny, empty notebook waiting to be filled with exiting tasks. Kind of feeling on top of everything because everything isn't defined until you start writing out the tasks :-).<br><br>With AF4, the occassional rewriting of tasks at dismissal or when starting a new notebook is enough to satisfy that feeling, so I'm not really tempted to switch systems. DIT2 excepted of course :-):-).</div>

<div class="content">Mark, it seems to me that this time around you are making exceptionally positive remarks about the upcoming system. Is it just me or are you more upbeat than with the various previous AF versions? Do you really believe that 'DIT2' could be the ultimate time management system?</div>
<h2>Reply by Christian G.</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-01-26 17:45</div>
<div class="content">promises, promises... ;-)<br><br>But honestly: we all should avoid to spend to much time with the time management system instead of working on the tasks in it. AF (all version) was already a big step forward for me in this respect. I am fiddling a lot less with the TM system and get a lot more work done.<br><br>Nevertheless: I must admit that I'm curious as well...</div>

I want to be ready to try out DIT2 when it is released.  And I too have gone back and read DIT again to refresh my memory.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I've not wrapped my arms around the physical manifestation of a "daily diary".  I'm envisioning a page-a-day planner, but most are appointment-centric, leaving only a small section for tasks.  What are some specific examples of daily diaries in use by DIT folks?  From DIT Chapter 9, it sounds like it should be an easy item to find, but I imagine it will become an obsession with time management tinkerers.</div>

Hmmm.  Yeah.  Right.  LOL!  Personally, I'm hoping that you'll never stop trying to improve upon whatever system you're using.  For your sake.  And for ours.  Please keep looking.  And many thanks to you for your time and effort.  Blessings and cheers to you!</div>

<div class="content">DIT - I've bought the daily diary, started collecting up each day's emails and post to process the next day, started my deadlined projects NOW with a little-and-often approach, not delaying them till a later date. Today's email folder is empty, as is my intray, and I have do-able tasks and daily routines listed for today. <br><br>It all seems too good to be true. What's going wrong :-}</div>

<div class="content">I've only read the forum and liked the idea of Autofocus so much so that I have listed all my 'backlog' into a notebook - I really have to get into the habit of entering all items as they come in!  So far this is a real achievement as previously I had them all over the place.  Also it has stimulated ideas as the how to improve other things - for example setting up daily/weekly/monthly rituals or habits.<br><br>As I haven't actually read DIT I decided I should, so I have ordered it from Amazon and am eagerly awaiting it's arrival.  This will put me in a good position should I decide to use DIT2 when it is 'unveiled' although I get the impression DIT2 is really a series of tweaks to the original DIT to make it even better (hence buying the book).  I also believe that for the price of the book (I paid under £6 for it new) - even if I get only one or two really good ideas to make life easier it will be worth it!!  Also it is a way of contributing to Mark's excellent ideas - hopefully he gets royality on each book sold.<br><br>I have a very tasty Filofax cherry red leather A filofax which is very underutilised.  I also have a page a day diary for this filofax, so if it is suitable I think I'll probably plan to use that if I decide on DIT2.<br><br>Can't wait to read the book. and read DIT2. I have been so disorganised in my recent past that this is a real boost to me and will I know reduce my stress levels considerably.</div>

It shouldn't be this difficult in the US.  :-)<br><br>If any Americans have a lead on an appropriate diary for DIT/DIT2, please share.</div>

<div class="content">A simple moleskin or other undated but lined calendar is more than fine.  $10-20 at your local bookstore, Borders, or Barnes and Noble.  DIT definitely does not require a specialized calendar.</div>

If someone would like one, I could pick one up and send to you.

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>I just realized that I instinctively searched on amazon.com instead amazon.co.uk. Brownline seems to be US/Canada only, that's why you couldn't find it.<br><br>Another alternative also available in UK would be the moleskine daily planner. It has time slots, but they are really unobstrusive: <a href="http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o232/dinodressed/moleskine.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o232/dinodressed/moleskine.jpg</a> - also comes in different sizes and as soft- or hardcover.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-01-28 12:51</div>
<div class="content">I personally think it's in the spirit and rationale of DIT to put tasks within the same page as scheduled appointments in a day per page diary (i.e. not in a seperate notebook) so it's possible to see how much discretionaery time is available. Importantly, it's often clear to see why it's not been possible to complete the closed list. Also, it's quite easy to refer to when a task was done. <br><br>I had a lot of success with the diary below for DIT well over a year. The picture though shows the weekly format for some reason. Wether it will work for DIT 2 I am not sure yet. <br><br>Mark, are you able to comment before I rush out right now and buy one ?!  <br><br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Collins-Classic-Appointments-Half-Hourly-W190xH260mm/dp/B0029YBCB6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=officeproduct&qid=1264682475&sr=1-4" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Collins-Classic-Appointments-Half-Hourly-W190xH260mm/dp/B0029YBCB6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=officeproduct&qid=1264682475&sr=1-4</a></div>

<div class="content">Alison R:<br><br>True, the 'large' moleskine is more like A5. But whether you really need A4 is another question. I have the impression Mark likes to have much room. IIRC he used A4 for AF too. I for example used A7 for AF, and Mark said we need a larger notebook for DIT2 because we need two columns. So I think I will be fine with A5. But then again my handwriting is rather small, so it may not be for everyone.<br><br>Another thing is that the moleskine is the only product mentioned so far that I can get off amazon.de instead of importing from US or UK. But I'm still looking. ;-)</div>

<div class="meta">2010-01-28 14:18</div>
<div class="content">Leon and Andreas:<br><br>There's no doubt that DIT2, as I'm testing it at present, uses quite considerably more space than DIT. For example yesterday was a fairly typical day for me. The page for that day needed room for 121 tasks.<br><br>Most people probably won't use DIT2 for *everything* in the way that I am at the moment. If you consider what proportion of your waking day you are likely to use it for, then you can arrive at an approximate figure for you.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-01-28 14:24</div>
<div class="content">Seems to me that the sensible thing to do is to wait until Mark is ready to share, and then we can all make up our minds on the best format for our needs. It's likely that one size will not fit all!</div>

<div class="content">I've been getting along so well with AF4, and I've never been able to continue with a system for anywhere near this long before, that I'm almost reluctant to disrupt things with DIT2.  <br><br>I think my real concern is that when I read it I'll want to try it because, like others here, I'm always keen to see if something else works better than whatever I'm doing now.</div>
