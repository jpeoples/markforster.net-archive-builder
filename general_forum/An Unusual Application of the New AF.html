<div class="content">I homeschool six children and have a detailed and specific schedule for the school day. Much of the time this works well, but at a certain point in the school year, it begins to break down. I believe I understand why. I detest routine. I hate feeling obligated. I thrive on newness, freedom, and fun. I believe that is why AF has worked longer for me than any other approach. There's little scheduling of tasks, duty, and forcing oneself to do things.<br><br>So I started thinking about using AF for our school day. I have a list of things that should be accomplished on a given day (everything is pre-planned). I also have my detailed schedule of subjects to teach. I wondered if just taking the list of subjects and teaching the subject that stood out first would work. Then I worried that I would lose the benefits of the schedule should I use that approach every day. Then eureka! I realized I could have a daily list of subjects with the addition of the subject: Use the Schedule. When using the schedule stands out, I will use it. When I would rather teach subjects as they stand out, I will. I am really excited about this approach as I think it will virtually eliminate any reticence I've experienced as a result of feeling obligated by the schedule. Thanks, Mark! I plan to use a checklist in Listomni that I can clear and start over with each day. Because I like to have the opportunity to do some interest-based learning (also called unschooling), I may add this to the list and unschool whenever that stands out, too! If this method is successful for me, I will blog about it and share it with other homeschoolers, too.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Mel,<br><br><br>there are some types of schools in Germany (Montesori, Waldorf) that work with a flexible schedule with great success. I strongly believe that the right balance between a fixed schedule and freedom is the key to success. You have to break free once in a while. I had a teacher that worked this way. "the physics experiment we are working on is too interesting to stop now. Tomorrow there will be enough time for math. Let's continue.". Great! Never had so much fun learning.<br><br>And that is why i love AF. It forces me to do the things i have to do, but gives me the flexibility to let my intuition decide when to do what for how long.<br><br>I whish you success with your experiment!</div>

<div class="content">Steffen, thanks so much for the encouragement. I know from experience how important a love-of-learning approach is to homeschooling, but at the same time there are those who emphasize the importance of structure and scheduling. I am just so delighted to find a balance that I believe will work beautifully for my family. I do know that just with TM, different approaches work for every family. I look forward to reporting my results!</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br>That sounds just like the sort of thing which we could/should be discussing on the proposed World Domination group (not that it will actually be called that!)<br><br>I wasn't quite clear from your description whether it was just your personal decision what to teach, or whether the children got a say as well.</div>

<div class="content">Mark I was thinking the same thing re: your new group. I have thought about letting the kids determine what to study when. I have the kids rotate days that are their day to have privileges like choosing where to sit, etc. (to save arguments). What has me leaning away from letting the child choose is that I may feel obligated to do things that child's way which may motivate me less, not more. The kids already have individual assigned work that they can and do work in an AF style. As I am writing, however, I am realizing that I should also add to my school list, "Let the child of the day choose the subject" and see whether it stands out. <br><br>This kind of concept would be very appealing to the homeschool market. I would be glad to help you get the word out in a manner you see fit. Let me know when moving forward stands out for you. :-)</div>

<div class="content">LOL ;-)  I just checked... it seems to be available.  It is entirely possible that Yahoo will concede the title of Ultimate Grand Poohbha and Lord of the Universe to you!  ;-)</div>
