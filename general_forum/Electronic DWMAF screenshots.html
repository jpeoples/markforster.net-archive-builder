<div class="content">nuntym,<br><br>Interesting.  Why are the dates in reverse order, or is that done to show the latest tasks entered at the top?<br><br>RJ</div>

<div class="content">@Alan: *tilts head sideways, squints close to the screen* <br><br>Wow. I cannot imagine how that works, but wow. O.O<br><br>@RJ: Yes, I wanted the latest tasks entering from the top.  I do not know why, but that works better for me than if the latest tasks are at the bottom. *shrugs*</div>

<div class="content">My ListPro application (synchronised on PC and WM smartphone) is a bit simpller in the reverse order  ie latest entry last, as per DWM practice.<br><br>However, I do show the stuff that HAS to be done today, with must-dos, closed lists and current initiative together in one colour, Daily, weekly and monthly routines are in another colour, but in the correct date order, tasks within the next 7 days are in a third colour, the latest and the rest have no shading.<br><br>Projects/major tasks can be expanded or collapsed so that I can see what is the next step.<br><br>Working ok for me, but at the back of my mind is whether the manual approach, well illustrated by Sarah a few hours ago, isn't really the better way, it's more rigorous and less susceptible to manipulation.<br><br>Read into that last statement what you will!</div>

Mine is not the most efficient system, but it's the most fun system I've seen in a long time. :-) <br><br>Imagine a poster board with sticky tags on sticky cards.  Each card is a day.  Each tag is a task.  Add stuff anywhere, move things around at will.  Make lists on other cards and link tasks to those lists.  Zoom, pan, and tilt.<br><br>And change everything to bright colors :-)</div>

<div class="content">I do not have really large lists (about 30 to 40 at a time). My touch app is TaskPaper, which I love. It is also available on the Mac. If you want to use it on Windows, you can go with Todopaper, which is a near clone. The app works like a simple text editor in many ways, but has some wonderful built in additions that allow tagging and easy drag and drop rearranging of the items on the list. It works pretty closely to pen and pencil.<br><br>The first two are the iPhone/Touch app.  The third is my Windows app.<br><br><a href="http://bit.ly/aW1iI6" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/aW1iI6</a></div>

<div class="content">Here's a sample image of my current setup.<br><br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/394006/DWM_sample_image.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/394006/DWM_sample_image.jpg</a><br><br>The only way I have made DWM work to my satisfaction is to use an electronic approach. The program is ListPro. The file is stored on a microSD card. I use the same file whether away (on my smartphone) or at the PC.<br><br>The columns to the right are for filtering. Each task can (and usually does) have more than one filter.<br><br>The date highlighted magenta is today, and includes indented tasks which will expire today.<br><br>Then there are several yellow days, with green signifying a week from now, where tasks are moved to (drag and drop) after being worked on.<br><br>New tasks are entered at the end (26 April).<br><br>Recoloring and adjustment to the list is a quick morning operation every day.<br><br>The blue Bookmark line is dragged round and round the list (top to bottom), pausing when it is  above a task which stands out. There is only one bookmark, that is why all the filters are set on it.<br><br>Other than ListPro, the only program I am aware of that enables this solution is TodoPaper (or the very similar TaskPaper). However these have no equivalent for Windows Mobile.</div>

<div class="content">Chris,<br><br>Thanks for sharing this, I've already downloaded the trial for Windows.  A couple of quick questions before I get back to my priority task for today which ia already on my list under today's date.<br><br>is "DWM" a Project and are your bold Dates a subset of DWM, or is DWM just acting as a file reference and each bold date inserted with Control+P?<br><br>Do you have separate files for each project, or are they nested somewhere under DWM?<br><br>If you don't want to discuss this on the forum, please email me rhj1947ATgmail.com<br><br>I'll drop a line to the developer re using this on Windows Mobile even if it is only as a text file.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurenace,<br><br>As you can see from my previous post, i am trying TDP, I like its simplicity, but thanks for showing your ListPro, I may still stay with LP at the end of my TDP trial.<br><br>The appeal of both is the low overhead.</div>

<div class="content">Todopaper is really like a simple text program.  You just type and hit enter. After you create a new file, you just start typing. If you get rid of the leading dash and end a word or sentence with a colon, the entry is made bold (called a project). If you just hit enter, you will get a task entry (with a dash). If you take away the leading dash and just type, the entry becomes a note. You can use the tab key to indent items. I have no need for the DWM title at the top.<br><br>So each day, I just enter a new "project" at the end of the list (today I will enter April 26) and a new project in the middle of the list for today plus 7.<br><br>For projects, I would use the @ tagging method. You could follow any entry related to the "Smith Report" project  with, for example, @Smith_Report. You can then use the search functionality to filter for items in that project (simply type @Smith_report into the search field.) You can also double click any "project" (in my case, the date) or any tag to do a quick filter to show the items on that date (or project) or items with that tag.<br><br>Todopaper is still new. The original "TaskPaper" for the Mac is much more capable. It allows you to save filtered searches as tabs at the top. <br><br>I originally went with taskpaper when Mark moved to (I think) Autofocus 3. This was when he began treating the tasks as if in one big list. I have early onset of arthritis and could not effectively use a notebook. I wanted something very simple that was literally a list. Back then all I wanted was new entries to appear at the end of the list and have the ability to cross out done items. Most todo programs were too much. I did not need dated entries or due dates--just a list.  I thought about using a text editor but you can't easily change the font or show text as crossed out. That is when I found TaskPaper (I have an iMac, but have been booting into Windows 7 for about six months now so I switched to todopaper.)<br><br> TaskPaper (or Todopaper) works well on the earlier Autofocus systems (particularly Autofocus 4 where all you really want is a simple list.) But I love it so much that I still use it for DWM.</div>

<div class="content">Chris,<br><br>Thanks for your explanation and pics. It is tempting to try it although I'm a bit reluctant to pay for a program that doesn't seem to be actively developed, and has no help available (apparently they had a server crash and lost the Wiki).<br><br>One question: how do you sync between TodoPaper and the iPhone?</div>

<div class="content">Roger<br><br>I'd have used TDP if there were an option for Windows Mobile which includes filtering.<br><br>However there is an iPhone version, so I reckon it is a good solution for iPhone users.<br><br>I think the concept of using a text file is very striking.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence,<br><br>Yep, and I bought another WM device last year thinking MS would eventually get it right, as indeed it did with Windows 7.  I upgraded my 2008 Toshiba notebook last year, no regrets.<br><br>I've stayed away from the iPhone because all the hype and style, now I'be got WM 6.5 and the latest blogs and feeds say WM market share has started plummeting, some folk think Windows Phone 7 may be too late.<br><br>So maybe one day the iPhone may become as acceptable in business as the Blackberry  and I'll have another look the iPhone.  But I won't touch the iPad, not practical enough for business use which i need as a one man-show, and as a grandfather!</div>

<div class="content">Vikram:<br><br>Yes the symbols are for contexts, V is for vacation (to be deleted soon!), S for Studio, H for home and so on. In ListPro when you add a new record, you can tick the boxes for different contexts - being able to have multiple contexts has turned out to be an issue for many in AutoFocus and DWM, so a phone call I can make either from the Studio or Home gets a symbol in the H and S columns. The illustration show items related to vacation (V) for bringing up at a meeting (column T).<br><br>Roger:<br><br>I have had to reject the iPhone as there is no good stylus - likewise the HD2 for Windows Mobile - art and Excel are hard with a thick fingertip.<br><br>But sadly, Microsoft (like Psion before it) have decided to make their next system (WM7)  incompatible with previous versions, so I am staying with an older smartphone for the time being - let's see how things develop.</div>

<div class="content">Wooba<br>I use the taskpaper iphone app mostly.  They use a sync called simpletext which syncs between their iphone app, the Mac taskpaper app, and the website www.simpletext.ws. I sync between the iphone app and the simpletext.ws web site since I use Windows. From the web site I can see my task list (that I create and edit on the iphone app) and add to it like any other text file, using their formatting rules (using the tag @done for finished tasks, etc). In other words, simpletext.ws can either serve as a simple backup of your task list if you use their iphone or mac app, or it can serve as a simple stand alone online task list if you only have the iphone app and need to access your task list once and a while from any computer and don't want to buy the computer app. I also think you can use simpletext.ws by itself, since you only need a google login to access it.<br><br>It does not currently sync with the todopaper app directly, but you can copy and paste from simpletext.ws directly to the todopaper data file (which is a plain text file) and keep them in sync.</div>
