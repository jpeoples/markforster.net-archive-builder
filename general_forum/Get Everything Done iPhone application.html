<div class="content">Alex,<br><br>Here is your feedback ;-)<br><br>1) Very nice as shown on the video.<br><br>2) If you don't have it already, you need to have some way of doing bulk import/export of tasks.  Many of us have an implementation in other software and don't relish the idea of stating over just to try something new.  Starting over is a big impediment to your market penetration.<br><br>3) You need some kind of  backup.  This could be a simple export but I'm sure you can come up with something better.<br><br>4) You could easily draw the red line automatically if a subsequent pass of the closed list produces no action on any task.  But then you would need a way to delete the line so that someone could simply review the task list without triggering that action.  (Yeah, not strict AF4,  but what the hell?  ;-)<br><br>5) I second the requests for dates.  I would like to see a "task create date" and a "task completed date" added automatically, and the provision to allow at least one other date for a "task due date".  Possibly another for "task start date".  (All of this is not AF4, but useful).  For the optional date I would like them to not get in the way of your simple interface.  Perhaps a button to click to allow them to be entered if desired but left blank (and no form to fill) if they are not specifically requested. <br><br>6) Along with optional dates, optional tags or categories would be REALLY REALLY helpful.  The main reason I use software is so that I can filter tasks so that if I'm working in the yard, I can see all my yard tasks and nothing else.  (On paper I keep them in a separate list but electronically, I see tags as a better solution.)<br><br>7) Lower on the priority list for requests would be some control over appearance.  I.E. color for strike out, simpler strikeout (rather than the scribble over business you have now), font size and style, etc.<br><br>8) Along with the request for export, it would be nice to be able to control the format of the export.  This would allow exporting to a word processor or something that would allow printing for those who want to have a printed list.  (A much lower priority, of course.)<br><br>All in all, a very nice first cut.  I would be happy to test for you but I'm not sure I want to do all that is necessary to get binaries installed on the iPhone.  (I do realize the nonsense that Jobs has put in your way ;-)<br><br>Also, if you need anyone to clean up the English in your documentation, I would be glad to do that for you.  I could turn around a few short pages in less than a day.<br><br>Again, nice work.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, thx a lot for you feedback. <br><br>1) we are going to make more tutorials, the next one will be: how to use twitter to add new tasks, and how to backup all your tasks<br><br>2) yes I know that most of you guys already using some app to manage your tasks.

To restore just open that email on your iPhone and tap on restore link.<br><br>4) We probably can automate entire AF4 workflow, but I don't want to do that, because I believe not everyone use AF4, and some one has custom workflows. So we want to give the user maximum freedom to do stuff as he likes.<br><br>5) task created date and tasks completed date will be added in the v1.1. Task due dates will be also supported in v1.1 but we see them more widely. You can read about that in ideas.gedapp.com<br><br>6) I am also thinking that we need some kind of categories. But we have a much better idea how to do that. Tags and categories are complex and not very easy to adapt. I tried tags in Things and was not able to create some meaningful tag hierarchy.<br><br>7) We will do that. also I am thinking about different paper templates, colors, etc.<br><br>8) I believe export to Excel should works fine. Excel has really nice analysis features.<br><br>We made very detailed page how to install app while it in review.

<div class="content">Alex,<br><br><br>>>>  1) we are going to make more tutorials, the next one will be: how to use twitter to add new tasks, and how to backup all your tasks  <<<<br><br>Great.  Your tutorial worked well.<br><br>>>>  2) yes I know that most of you guys already using some app to manage your tasks. The tough task here is to understand what app is most popular. We will do that in the next versions.  <<<<br><br>Gotcha.  If I were you, I'd look at various applications and see what options they have for exporting tasks and see if there is some intermediate format that can be used.  For example: email, Excel, flat text file, etc.  I know that the user will have to do some fiddling, but since that is a one time thing, it is acceptable.  I realize how hard that can be, especially considering the restrictions iPhone places on all of this.<br><br>>>>  3) GED already has a backup feature :) You can go to app settings and backup all your tasks to your email box. To restore just open that email on your iPhone and tap on restore link.  <<<<br><br>Super.  I did not see that.  It makes all the difference.<br><br>>>>  4) We probably can automate entire AF4 workflow, but I don't want to do that, because I believe not everyone use AF4, and some one has custom workflows. So we want to give the user maximum freedom to do stuff as he likes.  <<<<br><br>Understood.<br><br>>>>  5) task created date and tasks completed date will be added in the v1.1. Task due dates will be also supported in v1.1 but we see them more widely. You can read about that in ideas.gedapp.com  <<<<br><br>Great.<br><br>>>>  6) I am also thinking that we need some kind of categories. But we have a much better idea how to do that. Tags and categories are complex and not very easy to adapt. I tried tags in Things and was not able to create some meaningful tag hierarchy.  <<<<br><br>Yes, I know how confusing that can be.  If nothing else, just add a couple of fields like: F1 and F2 which the user can sort and filter on.  Then what F1 means to me can be different than what it means to someone else ... but I'll be able to filter my tasks on it.  Of course, you'll all the ability to sort and filter (both) on due date, and such, right?<br><br>>>>  7) We will do that. also I am thinking about different paper templates, colors, etc.  <<<<br><br>Sweeeeeet ;-)<br><br>>>>  8) I believe export to Excel should works fine. Excel has really nice analysis features.  <<<<br><br>I had not even thought of that ... the analysis angle.  I was just thinking of printing.  But some might like to do analysis.  Good idea.<br><br>>>>  We made very detailed page how to install app while it in review. Just click on In Review button on site's main page.  <<<<br><br>I read it, and it is very clear.  I'm just not sure that I want to do all of that.  I'll see if my mood changes in a couple of days ;-)<br><br>>>>  I would be very happy if you point me into some English errors on main site. I am not a native English guy, so I'll appreciate any help with this. <<<<br><br>Your command of English is impressive.  English has pitfalls which non-native speakers fall into.  The problem is that those can be pervasive.  In the case of your documentation, it is mostly errors of "agreement" for want of a better term.  Plural terms have to agree, for example.  The only way I can describe it is that you have to develop an "ear" for the language.  I don't know what is right because of rules, though I can often cite the rule, but becuase it "hurts my ear" when I hear it.  That is why I offered to error check for you before you put documentation out there.<br><br>>>>  And than you for you feedback. I'll add it to ideas.gedapp.com for tracking. <<<<br><br>You are entirely welcome.</div>

<div class="content">Since I'm in the process of figuring out whether I can/should buy an iPhone (vs. e.g. iPod Touch or nothing at all), does this application work when you currently don't have an internet connection? I.e. can I add, complete, review, tasks while offline?<br><br>While Tony's application looked impressive and seems to work okay, I must say that your application looks awesome. I'm sure there will be quite a few issues that could be streamlined in terms of user interaction, but so far it looks really nice.</div>

Have you considered Excel?  I know you mentioned it elsewhere.  I suggest it because ListOmni uses Excel as its interface ... it is apparently a lot of work for anyone to make a desktop application.

How are you going to use those printed pages?  <<<<br><br>Nothing at all, actually.  I was just representing those who seem to need a printed copy to carry.  I think the reason they do is that they like to see a lot in a single view, rather than page up and down.  For my part, I am fine without it.<br><br>>>>  I posted "Using Twitter with GED" tutorial to youtube. It shows how to setup and use Twitter with GED.   <<<<br><br>I'll check it out.</div>

I can see some people blasting through 100 pages in no time at all, and they're going to get annoyed having to pay for more pages too frequently. Also, I think you have to prepare yourself for a string of negative reviews from people will dowload the app for "Free" and then resent having to pay for refills. <br><br>Will give more feedback once I have been using the app for a little while more. <br><br>Trevor</div>

But would be a non-starter.  Do you really think that is Alex's pricing model?  I thought that he meant that there would be a "free version" for trial and then you could purchase an unlimited version for some small price ... maybe $0.99 or so ... which is the common price for iPhone applications.  I can't imagine that he plans to sell the application by the page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike,<br><br>I only have the Ad Hoc version installed, so I can't say - at the moment - whether the finished version will have the same pricing model. There is a countdown setting in the settings which shows how many pages you have left - at the moment I have 91. When I click on the countdown there is the option to buy another 100 pages for $2.99. <br><br>As I said, I don't have a problem with the concept in principle, but I think there should be tiered pricing for the refill pages.  <br><br>Alex was kind enough to provide me with an Ad Hoc version with 100 pages to start, and I am down to 91 already. The app store version only has 5 pages to start according to Alex's post above, which I'm already convinced isn't enough to give people enough time with the app to decide whether it really is right for them.<br><br>Based on my limited use of the app so far, I am really enjoying it. However, if the pricing model isn't right, with plenty of choice and really generous refill bundles, I can see the app getting a lot of flak in the app store.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex,<br><br>For what it's worth, I'm another person who's immediately turned off by both the pricing model, and the look of the app. <br><br>Pricing: Although it's true that, depending on one's usage, it might not be a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, it is a lot more money than one has to spend for similar apps (even if most of them aren't quite as well suited to AF). And quite apart from the money, there's the hassle factor of having to actually stop working one's list to purchase more pages every so often. <br><br>Look: Tastes vary, of course, but I'm quite put off by the alligator skin (like Avrum), the look of the pages themselves, and the choice of font. I wouldn't mention this if I didn't think that there are probably lots and lots of iPhone users like me – especially all the Mac users. The look of the app is very much at odds with the dominant Mac aesthetic, and that's surely taking a risk. Anyway, maybe it's superficial to disregard what maybe great function for reasons of form, but if so, it's clear from the blogs, reviews, etc., I read, that there are lots of similarly superficial people out there. I didn't even really explore the app once I'd seen how it looked (and this was before I knew about the pricing). I say this not to just be critical, but in the hope that it's useful feedback.</div>

<div class="content">If you follow the AF notion of little and often, you could do 50 tasks (usually the same ones) in a day.  Is that more expensive?  I'd hope not, as I wouldn't want a pricing model to influence how I worked.</div>
<h2>Reply by Trevor</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-11-5 19:40</div>
<div class="content">If you are doing around 50 tasks per day, you would have to buy a refill every couple of weeks, which would cost around $75 per year at the current pricing. To be honest, even $2.99 per month seems expensive to me.</div>

<div class="content">Really odd. FocusPad does AF almost perfectly, and web-sync is right around the corner (I'm Beta testing now). And the app is (drum roll)...<br><br>0.99. One dollar. <br><br>Choosing between these two products seems like a no-brainer IMHO.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-11-5 21:16</div>
<div class="content">From my experience with both apps, I have to say that I prefer both the look and feel of GED, including the alligator skin splash screen. Don't get me wrong: FocusPad is functional and works really well for Autofocus, but I do prefer apps to have a bit of visual pizzazz. GED puts a bit of fun into the whole process. Call me superficial, but I am prepared to pay a little bit of a premium for that - but the price has to be right.</div>

<div class="content">I believe you guys are right. If someone do 50 tasks a day 2.99$ for 100 pages is a lot. I am going to make price lower.<br><br>There is two ways how developers are doing their apps:<br>1) spend 1 month on app, sell it for 0.99$, make some money and forget about it forever<br>2) spend 4 month on app. sell it for 10.00$, make next versions free, add features, promote it, make it better and better.<br><br>I am form the second category and I want to do my app better. I dont want to sell app for 0.99$ like most of junk apps in AppStore.<br><br>Right now it doesn't have a lot of features, but it will. Right now you might not want to pay this money for it, but in month I believe you will think differently.

Is my math is wrong? <<<<br><br>It is not your math that is wrong.  What is wrong is the basic marketing model.  It is a basic rent vs. buy problem.  I'm a "buy" kind of guy ;-)  Once I decide I like something, I don't want to pay for it over and over.  Once is enough for me.  This is especially true of a software package.  There is really no justification for paying more than once for a product.  After all, once it is purchased, there is nothing more to buy.  What is the value added?  What is the justification for the nickle and dime approach?<br><br>If it is a question of buying bandwith, or storage space, or upgrades to the function of a software package ... then I can see it.  An ISP is giving me something for each payment I make.  The seller of backup services is maintaining a disk farm for me and keeping it running and backed up.  If I don't want new function in a product I don't have to buy it ... but the product will not STOP running.  In the model you have decided on (assuming your mind is made up) you are selling me something that will just stop working if I don't continually pay you ... pay you for what?  That is the question.  I guess it is bothersome because that question has no answer.<br><br>The other aspect is the old "Is this really too much to pay if it helps you?" challenge.  It is not new.  We are asked to "invest" in a product, not "buy" it ... by the sellers of encyclopedias and audio courses, with that technique.  The thing is, that kind of involves the seller of a product into my life in a way that repulses me.  I don't want someone measuring what things might be worth to me, in that way.  It may be, as you say, that I can get more than two months of use of a product for the price of a burger, but that is beside the point.  I don't compare burgers and software in that way.<br><br>The local health club here is selling their membership fee with the argument that it costs less than a Starbucks coffee every day.  So what?  What does coffee have to do with a gym membership?  Nothing.  It is just a marketing technique that confuses people when they can't figure out how to answer the question ... and while they are confused, the salesman slips a pen into their hands to sign on the dotted line.  LOL ;-)  The answer is really this:    Am I likely to stop drinking coffee now that I have the gym membership?  That is the basic flaw in the argument.  It is not a trade, it is an ADDITION.<br><br>I don't know if I explained it, but the whole idea of buying a product that is intentionally "broken", then paying someone to keep it running, is repugnant to me.  It feels a bit like extortion.  "Hey, you want to keep using your program?  Then pay Vinnie here every month.  Oh, and for just a bit more we'll make sure you don't have a fire."  LOL ;-)<br><br>Others may have a different view, of course.</div>

I wouldn't mention this if I didn't think that there are probably lots and lots of iPhone users like me – especially all the Mac users. The look of the app is very much at odds with the dominant Mac aesthetic, and that's surely taking a risk.  <<<<br><br>Yes, but all iPhone users are not Mac users, nor do they particularly care about "Mac aesthetic".<br><br>>>>  Anyway, maybe it's superficial to disregard what maybe great function for reasons of form, but if so, it's clear from the blogs, reviews, etc., I read, that there are lots of similarly superficial people out there.  <<<<br><br>LOL ;-) ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>>>>  If you follow the AF notion of little and often, you could do 50 tasks (usually the same ones) in a day. Is that more expensive? I'd hope not, as I wouldn't want a pricing model to influence how I worked.  <<<<br><br>Yes, that is what I was trying to say ... but you said it much better.</div>

<div class="content">Alex,<br><br>>>>  I believe you guys are right. If someone do 50 tasks a day 2.99$ for 100 pages is a lot. I am going to make price lower.  <<<<br><br>I believe you are going to have to abandon the "rental" model and sell it outright.<br><br>>>>  I dont want to sell app for 0.99$ like most of junk apps in AppStore.  <<<<br><br>To be fair, there are some very fine apps in the store for $0.99.  Yes, there is lots of junk, but also many good ones.<br><br>>>>  Right now it doesn't have a lot of features, but it will. Right now you might not want to pay this money for it, but in month I believe you will think differently. And I am not going to sell it right now for 1.99$ and make it 2.99$ next month, and 3.99$ after new year.  <<<<br><br>I understand your dilemma.  But there is some precedent for raising price as features increase.  And it becomes a question of letting the market tell you what it wants.  You'll have to convince people to pay you a second fee because your upgrades are worth it to them.</div>

<div class="content">Martin,<br><br>>>>I'd be okay with paying more than 99c for the 'right' app (I actually paid $10 last year for Appigo's To Do app which incidentally is still priced at that level and selling well)  <<<<br><br>I paid a few bucks for ListOmni because it did lots of things.<br><br>>>> However, as Alan suggested, the idea of charging for pages would probably have an impact (albeit subtle) on the way I use AF. It just seems a little nonsensical for an electronic app.  <<<<br><br>Indeed.<br><br>>>>  The To Do app marketplace is clearly pretty crowded with RTM, Toodledo etc all having excellent apps.

I mean, some like tags and others don't.  If they are then you can choose to NOT use them ... but if they are not there you cannot decide to use them.  One reason that people end up trying lots of applications is that none of them does exactly what they want.</div>

The manufacturer is providing new paper each time and it costs him to do so.  He has to go out and cut down trees.  Software is ... well, soft ... it has no physical existence.

Looking at what works in the iPhone market it seems to be:<br><br>- Provide a free app for people to evaluate.  The limited number of records is one way that is commonly used.  Nag screens or initialization delays are another then,<br><br>- Sell a fully functional application for some price.  What price?  It seems that this kind of application typically sells in the $0.99 to $1.99 range.  The ones that fetch more money have more function.<br><br>Also, it is worth considering that lower price points sell more units and so the overall income is more likely to be higher.  Oh, and one thing you don't want to do is get a negative buzz going.  The iPhone has a broad following and some of them are pretty nuts.  Once they get on your case they start talking it up and you end up fighting a bad image.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex,<br><br>I think the best option for you is to offer GED in both a free Lite version and a paid for Unlimited version - it cuts down on confusion for the average user. <b>Make it clear in the description for the Unlimited version that there is a Lite version which people can try before they buy the unlimited one<b/>.<br><br>Pricing for the unlimited version is tricky. I think you should set a low price initially, perhaps $2.99 or less to draw in new users and hopefully get a few good reviews. Update the app frequently, and experiment with raising prices incrementally.<br><br>GED is showing up when I do a search of the app store, so I guess it must have been approved by Apple. I haven't downloaded it yet because I'm still using the Ad Hoc version. I think you need to simplify the promotional info and encourage people more clearly to watch the video on your website, which does a better job of explaining what GED does.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is nothing in your promotional info which says that people are going to have to pay for more pages when they reach their limit. I think that's a recipe for disaster, frankly, and <b>I would pull the app from the app store before any damage is done</b>.<br><br>As I've said before, I really like the look and feel of GED, and would certainly consider paying for it at the right price.</div>

As to the number of tasks per page .... some of us are getting older and do not cope well with small point size.  One thing I liked about the look of Alex's app is that it is easy to read.  That just shows how hard it is to please everyone.  In the end, you wind up making the whole damn thing configurable.  Might as well just give the SDK to the end user!

I picked that up from my father as I've never spent more than a couple of weeks in Boston ... or anywhere else in Mass.  I also speak rather quickly ... which is somewhat at odds with the general Northeastern modality.  Most of my tean and early adult years were spent in Los Angeles so that probably tended to flatten out any accent I might have picked up from my earlier years in the Northeast./ Mid-Atlantic area.</div>

I agree with some that we should not be wondering how to use our tasks as economically as possible. If you'll browse through Mark's day with AF4, I think he made about 80 tasks or so that day. Granted, that's probably more than the average user, but that would basically mean it would cost $10 to use the app for a month. Would I pay $2.99 for unlimited tasks? I'm pretty sure I would. As for the trial version... 5 pages or 40 tasks really is not enough to "try" the system. Maybe it is for those who already now that AF works for them, but for those who don't, this is really not enough. At 25 pages (200 tasks), users will already be much closer at figuring out if it works for them or not.<br><br>2) I really do like the looks of the app as it is now. However it might be an idea to compliment this nice and warm "realistic" look with a minimalistic apple-style look so that people can choose between two very different styles to suit their taste.<br><br>Regards,<br>Tijl - who is still not sure whether he'll buy an iPod Touch, an iPhone with a plan, or nothing at all... :(</div>

<div class="content">must admit first up that I have not read all of the comments yet... so mine undoubtedly will duplicate what has already been said<br><br>great looking app... couple of comments/questions...<br><br>-- does the upgrade cost for unlimited pages auto default within the app to the local currency of the users iTunes Store ?<br>-- the page turning feature GUI... needs to reflect the actual graphic used on the page... displays rings of a ring binder on the left but the page flips upwards... as if tearing the pages out... therefore needs to be a horizontal motion... very annoying visually at the moment :-)<br>-- need to be able to double tap to be able to add a new item rather than having to hit the "+" button<br>-- need to be able to do the standard iPhone GUI of swiping over the entry to get a delete button for the deletion of an item... single tap for the selection (green highlight)... swipe to delete<br>-- I thought one was meant to be able to write below the "Closed" (red) line... if there is a closed line on a page the "+" adds a new page rather than a new item below the line... new to Autofocus so my idea of this could be totally screwed :-)<br>-- the auto function referred to in the forum could be added but as a preference/option under the settings<br>-- love the look of the app... the UI is great... except for the page turning direction<br><br>cheers from Oz</div>
