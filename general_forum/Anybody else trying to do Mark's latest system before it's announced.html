<div class="content">I've been more or less following AF4 for a while now.  Now that Mark announced something new is coming, I'm imagining what that might be, and remaking my process according to what I imagine the new system might be like.  Thanks, Mark :-)<br><br>Recently I've been getting this feeling I want to have more control over the Closed list.  It bugged me that the tasks I wanted to work on, they were all in the closed list, but they vanished [went to Open] as soon as I touched them, so in the spirit of Do It Today, I'm converting my Backlog list into a Today list [Closed to new tasks, though], and not letting these tasks sneak off to the next day when I do a bit of work.<br><br>That's not exactly right, but I don't want to get into details as I haven't fully tried this, and I don't want to preempt Mark by describing everything that I'll probably just throw out when Mark reveals his new system. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>Great minds think alike, fools etc ;-}  "More or less . . . "<br><br>I have settled into a reasonable modus operandi with AF4, but the DIT comments have been bugging me, I think in the same way as you have stated, ie you touch upon a Closed List item, and then it's back in the Open List.<br><br>As stated in Lyn's thread, I have divided my Backlog/Closed into a "DIT" section (highlighted yellow in ListPro) and the rest (tagged Backlog/Closed, but no highlight).  This has been in an attempt to establish a daily workload; maybe I should have tagged it "Backlog/DIT".<br><br>Like you, I suspect Mark's current initiative will see a more logical fusion of DIT and AF, but this time a second edition DIT book in the offing, and why not?<br><br>Aluta continua,<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">Not familiar with DIT, but are you suggesting that with DIT, you only work on a task onced during the day and then if not finished, it get's moved to tomorrow's list?</div>

<div class="content">Not so, Phil.  The idea is that you plan tomorrow's list of activities, today.  Tomorrow you work using that list as your plan.  With AF, you work on a task once then it moves to the open list.  With DIT they stay on the closed list.  I think.</div>

<div class="content">I am waiting patiently for full instructions and will then give it a go. <br><br>On another note, I have decided to make everything I have written now available for free while I concentrate on another venture.  For those of you that paid for an ebook,  I have all of your emails and will provide you with a free copy of my next ebook which I am planning to charge for.  It is not a time management book, but more of a goals determination and planning book.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry <br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Roger J:<br><br><< Aluta continua >><br><br>My Portuguese isn't very good, but shouldn't it be "A luta continua" - the struggle continues? Equivalent of "La lucha continua" in Spanish.</div>

<div class="content">Mark F,<br><br>You're probably right, my Portuguese is even worse than my Spanish, but my spelling is derived from the phonetics when it was used by the ANC in South Africa at funerals in the 1980s phase of the struggle against apartheid.<br><br>I guess they borrowed it from their Angolan and Mozambican colleagues.<br><br>A luta continua, which it does.<br><br>Roger J</div>
