<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Here is the how I plow through high-resistance and/or difficult tasks using AF2ND.  It uses the "Decremental Timebox" first introduced to the FV forum by GMBW over at this thread: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1842252" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1842252</a><br><br>The main requirement for this method is that the task can be left to idle without any due harm or annoyance to anyone or anything.<br><br>You will need an adjustable timer with an alarm for this.<br><br>1.  Determine the total time you need to tackle a difficult task, then look at the "Decremental Timebox → Real (=Full) Time Conversion Table" at the link above.<br><br>3.  Using what you saw from the table, write the task at the end of your AF2ND list like this: <br><br>Task x(y/z)<br><br>x = the total time you need to do the task <br>y = time decrement you are in now<br>z = the time decrement at the end<br><br>For example: "Clean Bathroom 30(1/7)" ---> You need to clean your bathroom for around 30 minutes (28 minutes, actually); you are currently on your first decrement, which will last 1 minute; the seventh and last decrement later should last 7 minutes.<br><br>4. When this item is "standing out", get your timer and set it to the time decrement for now (in this case, 1 minute).  Work on the task until the alarm goes off.<br><br>5.  Delete and re-write the item, but this time with y+1.<br><br>For this example, the rewritten item is "Clean Bathroom 30(2/7)"<br><br>6.  Repeat steps 4 & 5 until you end with the final time decrement, in this example 7 minutes.  By the end, you should have worked on your task for the required amount of time.<br><br>-----<br><br>Please note that you cannot use this approach, or at least will be hard to do, with AF1, AF4, or FV.  It is possible with DWM, DWM2, and the SFs, but it is obvious that this approach of "little and often" is almost tailor-made for AF2 and AF2ND.</div>

<div class="content">I thought about it last night, and decided that AF2ND is more promising than the approach I was working on, so I'm trying it out starting today.  My initial impression is good, I'll see how it works in practice.  I had 55 tasks on my list when I started the day.</div>

<div class="content">After one day of AF2ND, I'm a little concerned that my high-priority tasks are currently buried in the middle of the list, but I'll give it a little longer before trying any tweaks.  The count is now at 59, but I don't know if that's significant.  It did feel like I was getting useful things done, at least.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>@Deven: "I'm a little concerned that my high-priority tasks are currently buried in the middle of the list."<br><br>Why is that a problem?</div>
<h2>Reply by Deven</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-08-23 20:55</div>
<div class="content">Because I want them to get appropriate attention without having to game the system.  It doesn't matter if a high-priority task "stands out" if you don't get to it in the list!<br><br>I really love the idea of rewriting the oldest task to maintain a balance between old/neglected tasks and recent ones, and it also appeals to me on a simplicity basis.  Unfortunately, it also helps to bury things faster into the middle of the list, especially if long-neglected tasks do "stand out" and need attention.  Yes, everything will cycle around again, but not quickly enough for my taste.  Mind you, I do believe that AF2ND still improves on both AF1 and AF2 here, but I want something better.<br><br>I'm starting to believe that there's just no substitute for a certain amount of intelligent manual prioritization, so I'm back to adding stars to prioritize tasks, yet again.  I've tried similar tweaks to FV (to make Prioritized FV) and AF1 (for the variant I described in the above-referenced thread), and in my experience, it has been an improvement.  People consistently complain about the added complexity this entails, but I think the misquote from Einstein applies here: “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”  Removing all prioritization from the system seems to oversimply things to the point where priority tasks don't get appropriate attention, and that's a problem for me.  (Obviously, I may be in the minority here.)<br><br>That being said, after a mere 2 days on AF2ND (and another slight bump to 60 tasks), I've tweaked the system already.  (Sorry!)  Basically, I treat priority (starred) tasks as a mostly-independent AF2ND list, listed on different index cards from the main list.  I'm allowing for the possibility of multiple stars if necessary; this tweak is stackable.  (But as always, minimizing the use of stars is preferable.)<br><br>For the task selection process, I start with the highest-priority list and follow AF2ND rules, rewriting the oldest task on that list and scanning the list from the bottom for the first task that "stands out".  If nothing in the list "stands out", then I will cycle to the next (lower-priority) list and again rewrite the oldest task and continue.  After actioning a task, I return to the highest-priority list and start again.  Each priority level becomes its own AF2ND system, but the lower-priority lists are only processed when nothing is "standing out" on the higher-priority lists.  The idea behind this is to always keep priority tasks front-and-center so they can't be forgotten, without forcing them to be actioned at any particular time.<br><br>I'm quite looking forward to using this AF2ND variant; I think it will work very well for me.  Time will tell...</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Naah, it's ok.  I just found myself having no problem going to the high-priority tasks is all, even if they are right smack in the middle of the list.  As I said before, "such items stick out like sore thumbs in the mind's eye. AF2 will never let you forget those unfinished tasks that you left to idle minutes or hours ago."  Which is why I was wondering why you had problems with it, since you DID notice those high priority tasks in the middle of the list, as you said.<br><br>Maybe it's the use of index cards, as they naturally break up your list, so you see your list not as a single list (which is ESSENTIAL for AF2, and not so much for Mark's other systems) but as a series of lists, making your search for tasks harder.<br><br>May I suggest using instead a 3x5 notebook instead? This is what I use for AF2ND, actually.<br><br>Good luck with your tweak.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-08-24 15:56</div>
<div class="content">Until I come up with a better name, I'll call my variation "AF2ND+" to distinguish it.<br><br>AF2 does remind you of what you just did, but unless you keep working on the priority tasks over and over again, they won't stay near the end of the list long with AF2ND because old tasks keep getting recycled.  As I said, I love your tweak to help balance the old tasks against the new/urgent ones, but I soon found that the high-priority tasks had 20+ new tasks after them, simply because AF2ND kept grabbing old tasks that were waiting for attention.<br><br>I don't think the use of index cards has anything to do with it, because in AF2: "Pages are no longer treated as units. The new system is not affected by the length of page used."  Unlike AF1, pages aren't supposed to be reviewed, you just start at the end of the list and look for the most recent task that "stands out".  Although I'm aware that the high-priority tasks are there in the list somewhere, that doesn't change the fact that something I run into before them DOES "stand out" and therefore should be actioned according to the rules of the system.<br><br>Now, I've heard arguments like "you know something more important is coming up later, so you should skip over the earlier stuff until you get to it" -- this is what I consider to be "gaming the system".  Simply pretending that items don't stand out because you're eager to get to something you know is elsewhere in the list strikes me as disingenuous.  Besides, if it's a high-resistance high-priority task (as discussed at length in the FV forum), you won't want to do that anyhow.<br><br>The idea behind the AF2ND+ tweak is to make the prioritization explicit and keep those priority tasks up front by design.  (Using index cards is decidedly helpful here, because it's easy to add new cards in the middle as needed.)  It forces you to consider the high-priority tasks first, even if you don't end up doing them first.  For high-resistance tasks, it may also help break down the resistance better, if only because you get sick of seeing that task. :)<br><br>On a separate note, I would argue that if you are eager to do a particular task that is somewhere randomly in the middle of an AF2-style list, it's perfectly valid to jump to the middle of the list and do that task next.  One might argue that you're violating the AF2 processing rules by not contemplating each item in turn from the end of the list, but I would argue that this is functionally equivalent to writing a duplicate copy of the task at the end of the list (since you can add anything without filtering or evaluation) and then selecting it because it "stands out", then later deleting the original task in the middle of the list because it's now irrelevant as a duplicate.<br><br>Given that much of the value in any time management system lies in achieving a "mind like water" as David Allen calls it, any task that still calls to you in the back of your mind despite putting it into a trusted time management system is obviously "standing out" in a big way and likely deserves such treatment if it's something your mind can't let go of.  Note that doing this WOULD be a violation of the AF1 processing rules, but then you can always invoke the "common sense" rule in that case.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-09-19 16:32</div>
<div class="content">That was supposed to say "on-list", not "on-line".  Oops.<br><br>As for implementing AF2ND+ with non-detachable pages, it seems simple enough.  Don't mix priority levels on the same page and start new pages as necessary, allowing them to be interleaved.  It's not as nice as sortable pages (on index cards or in a loose-leaf notebook), but it's functionally equivalent.<br><br>Example:<br><br>Page 1: normal tasks<br>Page 2: priority tasks (*)<br>Page 3: normal tasks<br>Page 4: normal tasks<br>Page 5: priority tasks (*)<br>Page 6: normal tasks<br><br>With this set of pages, you would start with the highest priority level (which you'd have to know is one star), and rewrite the oldest task on page 2 to the bottom of page 5, then scan upward from the bottom of page 5 looking for a task that "stands out".  If you reach the top of page 5, continue from the bottom of page 2.  If you reach the top of page 2, rewrite the oldest task on page 1 onto the bottom of page 6, then scan upward from the bottom of page 6, continuing with page 4, page 3 then page 1 if necessary.<br><br>This is functionally equivalent to the way I do it with index cards, but I like the index cards better, personally.  Have you ever tried using index cards for this, by any chance?</div>

<div class="content">Okay, it's been a few more months.  I'm still using AF2ND+, with mixed results.  When I focus on using the list and keep up with it, it seems to be effective, but I still have a persistent problem with setting the list aside and working without it, which is a problem I've had with every system I've tried.  Perhaps the prioritization tweak to make AF2ND+ is causing some sort of resistance to the list because I'm always stuck focusing on priority tasks without making any progress on others.<br><br>I think I'm going to experiment with the original AF2ND to see if it works better for me.<br><br>Is anyone else using either AF2ND or AF2ND+?</div>

<div class="content">Deven,<br><br>Try re-evaluating the priority of some of the things you aren't making progress on. The lack of progress is bothering you, so maybe it really is a priority.<br><br>I like making pretty things that need skill and attention. Most of them just gather dust, and you can buy a lot of socks for $25 (hand-painted merino yarn) and 10 hours of knitting. But making them makes me happy. They refresh me. They give me a sense of accomplishment. They activate all my senses. They intrigue and interest me. They make me slow down. Spending a bit of time each week making pretty little things is a priority for me.<br><br>The danger is re-activating too many projects at once. I have a box full of UFOs (unfinished objects), and it grows over the winter thanks to my needlecraft guild. The priority is "enjoy working on a pretty little thing", which includes the joy and pride of finishing it, not "make progress on and finish every single one of them."</div>

<div class="content">Okay, I've been back on the original AF2ND for 2 weeks now, and I've been happier with it.  Using AF2ND+, I sort of felt "trapped" on the priority sub-list and never made any progress on the main list, which generated resistance.  However, I have retained my stars from AF2ND+ while processing the list as an AF2ND list, and I was finding that priority tasks were getting buried again, and I still don't like that.<br><br>Starting today, I'm trying a much simpler prioritization tweak.  Instead of the approach with AF2ND+ where I effectively made a separate priority AF2ND list, I am keeping one long list again, and following the AF2ND processing rules with the addition of one new daily process.  At the start of the day, I scan the entire list, starting with the oldest tasks.  Any given task can be reprioritized at this time, adding or removing stars.  I then rewrite all prioritized tasks at the end of the list, starting with the single-starred tasks, then double-starred, etc.  For the rest of the day, the list is processed according to AF2ND rules.<br><br>Here's the rationale behind this tweak:<br><br>(1) There is still no substitute for manual prioritization.  When you need it, you need it.  (But when you don't need it, the system remains identical to AF2ND.)<br>(2) This is a much simpler tweak than AF2ND+ and avoids complicating the processing rules.<br>(3) Rewriting all the priority tasks every day prevents them from getting buried in the middle of the list.<br>(4) It also serves as a mental review of all priority tasks, which are necessarily brought to mind as a consequence of rewriting them.  (This may reduce resistance to working on them later in the day?)<br>(5) It also encourages focusing on fewer priority tasks, since the more priority tasks there are, the longer it takes to rewrite them every day.<br><br>I guess I'll call this one "AF2NDP" for "Autofocus 2, No Dismissal, Prioritized".  That way, if I have future tweaks, I can continue numbering with "AF2NDP2", in case nuntym ever wants to make "AF2ND2"...<br><br>Time will tell if this tweak works any better than the last one.  I'll report back sooner or later!</div>

<div class="content">Cricket, thanks for the thought, but it wasn't that these old tasks were a priority, but rather that I was tired of seeing the same card over and over and over again without changes.  At least with AF2ND or AF2NDP, the oldest cards go away as tasks get rewritten, whether or not they're done.  Somehow that feels like progress, or something. :)</div>

<div class="content">I've not read into this thread before, and I must say that I very much like the idea of AF2ND as originally proposed by nuntym. <br><br>I think one of the things I've noticed with my ceaseless experimenting over the ages is that any method of prioritization always seems in the end to result in increased resistance, which will build up to the extend that the list is avoided or, worse, abandoned.<br><br>The art of constructing an algorithm for processing a list is that the mind must be allowed to access the tasks it wants to access, but at the same time must be subtly encouraged to want the right things. AF2 was good in many ways but the problem was that stuff got progressively more unlikely to get done. nuntym's solution is a good way to overcome that.<br><br>Are there other ways of achieving the same result in AF2?</div>

<div class="content">I've been thinking about ways to answer my own question in my last post, and one thing that occurred to me is that one could achieve a similar (though not identical) effect with considerably less writing. Instead of starting from the end of the list and working backwards, you start from the first task on the list and work backwards from there (i.e. circulating back to the end of the list). Each time you select a new task, you take your start point one task further up the list.<br><br>So for example you have:<br><br>Task A<br>Task B<br>Task C<br>Task D<br>Task E<br><br>You take Task A as your start point and then consider tasks in the order A, E, D, C, B. <br><br>The next pass you take Task B as your start point and consider the tasks in the order B, A, E, D, C.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, thanks for weighing in.  I've always wondered what your opinion would be; I do consider nuntym's original AF2ND proposal to be excellent, and I definitely hear what you're saying about prioritization tending to generate resistance.  That's exactly the problem I found with my AF2ND+ experiment, and why I'm trying a different approach with AF2NDP.  I hope that by forcing initial attention on the priority tasks just once a day will avoid the resistance problem, but I'll see what happens in practice.  Do you believe it's equally doomed as other prioritization methods?</div>

<div class="meta">2013-01-25 19:42</div>
<div class="content">Mark, your suggestion to wrap around the end of the list seems similar to AF2ND's rewriting in effect -- certainly it gives some attention to older tasks that can be too easily forgotten with AF2.  It's a bit different in that old tasks don't get recycled and interspersed with new tasks, as they do when you work a task in AF2 or with AF2ND's automatic rewriting of the oldest tasks.  Also, it requires keeping track of a moving target for the starting point, which might be tricky without something like a sticky arrow.  AF2ND seems like a simpler solution (to me), despite the additional rewriting.  Also, I find that rewriting the oldest tasks makes the list feel "fresher" instead of visiting "stale" pages over and over again.  (I literally had active pages from 2011!)<br><br>All of your Autofocus variants require rewriting tasks after working on them -- someone might suggest that it's easier to just leave the task where it is on the list until it's done, instead of rewriting it.  I don't recall, but didn't you say there was a psychological benefit to rewriting the task?  Would the same apply to the additional rewriting AF2ND entails?</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>One of the things I've noticed about rewriting tasks you're NOT doing is that it does at least force you to think about the task, if only for the few seconds that you're rewriting it.  Perhaps that helps plant a seed that can grow in your subconscious, softening you up to work on it?  I don't know.<br><br>That being said, I've actually found AF2ND's extra rewriting to be enjoyable, because it cleans up the list and feels like it gives some momentum to the processing, even if it really doesn't.<br><br>The idea behind rewriting the priority items once a day was to put an upper bound for how far they can drift toward the middle of the list, but I think the work required to rewrite them does naturally discourage having an overly long list of priorities.<br><br>I'm tending to use a double-star for more immediate today/tomorrow tasks, which is why the rewriting process is to rewrite those AFTER the single-star priorities, so they'll be considered earlier when working the list backward from the end.<br><br>However, I always hold my breath for a few weeks with any tweak to these systems.

If you can imagine how the list would look like after days of erasing and rewriting the oldest items on the list, you might see in your imagination that the list will become aesthetically cleaner than other systems because of how it creeps along the pages, leaving behind pages full of crossed out items.  Even better, each and every time you have to delete an older item is an opportunity to review its relevance and decide right then and there to either erase it for good from the list, keep it in a "Someday/Maybe" list, or rewrite it.  I found this latter effect to be better than dismissal.<br><br>(2) There is a psychological illusion of progress as one keeps on erasing and rewriting stuff, and as Deven noted it can give one a boost in confidence.  However, I found this effect to have a double edge: if this illusion of progress along the list is not accompanied by an actual progress of having important things done but only by having trivial things done, then there comes an psychological dissonance which will result in increasing resistance to using the list, which in my case resulted to a disgust of my own list and eventually changing to another system.<br><br>Forgive me, Deven, but I speculate that it is that adverse outcome that you want to avoid by trying to include priorities in AF2ND, right?<br><br>But anyways, that adverse outcome is the reason I eventually made POSCER (another thread here in the Discussion Forum), which is a priority-intensive system based on the POSEC method that I found in Wikipedia.  I am still using it, but like you said, Mark, I am finding increasing resistance in using it to the point that there have been days that I have not even touched the list.  However, I learned a lot from using it, and from that experience I have an idea for you, Deven, that may help in prioritization.<br><br>I propose just a simple change in how you <<choose a task>>: have two modes in determining which task will stand out.  <br><br>Starting from the end of the list, choose a task that "stands out" when you ask yourself this question: "What do I NEED to do right now?" There may or may not be such a task that will stand out.  If there is, do it.   But if not, go back to the end of the list again and, this time, choose a task that "stands out" with the question "What do I WANT to do right now?"<br><br>As you can see, this simple change in processing the list will highlight in your mind's eye the priority tasks and other more important tasks even if they are in the middle of the list (maybe to the point that you don't need to mark them...maybe), and yet will not trap you in your priorities.<br><br>I think I'm gonna try this :)</div>

<div class="content">Well, I didn't last long at my trial of my own tweak of AF2ND. What I found was that writing at the end of the list the things I wanted to do soon resulted in the AF2 aspects of the system being ignored. I never went deeper than 4 or 5 tasks into the system.<br><br>I then tried AF2ND on its own, as originally described by nuntym. But again I didn't find this worked well for me. The problem was that the tasks I was rewriting were so interspersed with new stuff that they disappeared as fast as they appeared and might just as well have been left at the beginning of the list.<br><br>So then I decided to give my original proposal a try:<br><br>"Instead of starting from the end of the list and working backwards, you start from the first task on the list and work backwards from there (i.e. circulating back to the end of the list). Each time you select a new task, you take your start point one task further up the list."<br><br>Two points of procedure:<br><br>1) I mark the start point by putting an underscore in front of the relevant task, e.g. _Email. This works well. No need for any sticky arrows. It's easy to see which the current mark is because every active task before it will also have a underscore, e.g.<br><br>_Email<br>_Check Diary<br>_Take over World<br> Arrange Paperclips<br> Push Pencils.<br><br>(Obviously the tasks should be aligned, but the comment box won't accept leading spaces)<br><br>2) I do not move the start point forward if the last task done comes from above the start point. The reason for this is that if I move the start point every time I do a task, the number of unactioned tasks above the start point can never get any smaller.<br><br>It's early days yet, but this seems to fit my style of working much better.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym, the adverse outcome I'm trying to avoid is for priority tasks to be neglected as they float into the middle of the list.  I don't experience the high-velocity processing that Mark seems to, so that area could take time to get to.  AF2ND+ wasn't bad, but it seemed to generate resistance by forcing too much constant attention on the priority tasks.  AF2NDP is an attempt to achieve a better balance, but it's too early to judge the effect.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting that you felt pressure to keep the "above the line" part as short as possible.  AF2ND as nuntym originally described shouldn't cause that, since it just recycles old tasks as if they're new again.  If you found that was burying the old items too fast as they're interspersed with new items, is there perhaps a better way to achieve a similar result without that problem?  Rewriting the old tasks as new at a different time or frequency perhaps?<br><br>My understanding was that the original AF2 was great in a lot of ways, especially for urgent tasks, but that it tended to neglect the oldest tasks on the list because you always start from the end and scan backwards, and generally never reach the start of the list.  AF2ND seems to avoid that problem, doesn't it?  It may not focus a lot of attention on those old tasks, but it does regularly cycle through them and prevent them from being forgotten completely, and perhaps that occasional level of attention is appropriate if there's a good reason those tasks have been neglected?</div>

<div class="content">I'm ready to report on AF2NDP, and of course, to replace it with AF2NDP2. :)<br><br>I have two separate lists, one for work and one for home.  Right now, my work list has 57 items total, of which 6 have a single star and 3 have a double star.  That's not too bad to rewrite once a day for AF2NDP, and after 7 working days using the system (having been out of the office for 4 days), it was working quite well for that list and not generating any resistance.<br><br>My home list has been mostly unused for many months because I haven't been in the habit of working a list at home, but I wanted to try AF2NDP at home to compare it in that context.  After aggressively paring down the number of priority items on my home list from about 30-40 priority items down to about 15-20 priority items, I started using AF2NDP at home on Saturday, January 26, the day after I started using it at work.<br><br>I followed the system at home as faithfully as I could, rewriting all my priority items on days when I was using the system, and trying to use the system most days.  (I think I missed a day or two.)  I got sick on Monday, February 4 and stopped working the list for the rest of the week.  Although I still used AF2NDP at work through Friday, February 8, my last time using AF2NDP at home was on February 3, when I rewrote 12 single-starred items and 3 double-starred items.<br><br>Especially because I keep my home list on a folded stack of 3x5 cards in my pocket, I found that AF2NDP was becoming too cumbersome to use at home, because the thickness of that stack was increasing more quickly due to the number of priority tasks I was rewriting and then mixing with old tasks from AF2ND's rewriting rule.  My stack now contains three cards started during this time which contain only 7 tasks between them, when each card can hold 10 tasks -- these three are mostly crossed-out from the daily rewriting.<br><br>On Saturday, February 9, as I was heading to bed, I decided to brain-dump new tasks onto my list and realized that Sunday was going to be a very busy day, requiring triple stars for the many tasks that I really wanted to finish on Sunday.  In addition to the 12 single-starred items and 3 double-starred items that I last rewrote on February 3, I added 7 more single-starred items (for a total of 19 single-starred tasks), 2 more double-starred items (for a total of 5 double-starred tasks) and 9 triple-starred items -- 33 priority tasks in all.  This was much more than I wanted to rewrite the next day under AF2NDP, so I started brainstorming yet again, and devised a different tweak which I shall henceforth refer to as AF2NDP2.  (Yes, the name is getting ridiculous, but at least I can keep track this way.)<br><br>Here are the rules for AF2NDP2:<br><br>(1) Start with nuntym's AF2ND rules.<br>(2) Items may be tagged with one or more stars to indicate higher priority.  (The number of stars on any item may be freely changed at any time.)<br>(3) Just one additional processing rule: after rewriting the oldest item on the list (per AF2ND rules), ALSO rewrite the oldest item at the highest priority level in use, IF there are any starred items in the list.<br><br>That's it.  Nice and simple, and as with several other priority tweaks I've devised, it devolves back to the base system whenever there are no priority items in the list.<br><br>Yesterday (Sunday, February 10) was an acid test for this new system, and it performed beautifully.  It was a very busy day, but AF2NDP2 kept me focused and on track for the entire day, when it would have been very easy to lose track of things and drop several of the balls I was juggling for the day.  I found it easy to work the system and to stay on-list.  (This has always been an issue for me.)  This new priority tweak did a perfect job of maintaining focus on the top priorities without generating any resistance whatsoever.  The only problem I had was that I tried to do too much and exceeded my available time, but that problem is out of scope for Autofocus systems.  At the end of the day, my home list had 63 items total, 24 of which were single-starred and 8 of which were double-starred -- all of the triple-starred tasks were completed.<br><br>As always, time will tell if this tweak holds up any better than the others.  Nevertheless, I'm quite pleased with the debut of AF2NDP2 and find it much improved over AF2NDP.</div>

<div class="content">Implementation note: I am using 3x5 index cards instead of a notebook for this, keeping the newest card on the top of the stack and the oldest on the bottom.  To help find the oldest priority task to rewrite for AF2NDP2 rules, I've decided to mark each card with the same number of stars as the highest-priority task on the card, and update that mark as necessary.  That way, I can just scan the stack for the oldest card with the most stars, rewrite the task, and update the stars on the card if nothing else remains at that priority level.

<div class="content">Caibre65, you've got it right, I'm rewriting 3-4 tasks each time I select a new one.  I think I have a higher tolerance for this rewriting than average, but I really don't mind rewriting 3 tasks at a time.  Rewriting 4 feels like a burden, and rewriting 5 felt ridiculous, which is why I merged my medium priorities with my high priorities and gave them all one star instead.<br><br>I understand why it seems like a lot of overhead, and if you're only looking at the task-selection process, it is.  But consider that this overhead takes the place of periodic reviews, dismissal processes, etc.  Most importantly, to me, is that it keeps me from losing track of what's important while giving me flexibility in working the list.<br><br>I just started using AF2NDP4 with the recommended priority levels yesterday, but it really feels balanced and I'm enjoying it.  Most of the systems I've tried have been difficult for me to stick with because I start to feel resistance to the system itself.  I've never felt ANY resistance to AF2NDP2, AF2NDP3 or AF2NDP4.  (These are the only systems that I've found myself consistently using at home, where it's so easy to not bother using a list at all...)  I believe each of these systems is suitable for long-term use, but I believe that AF2NDP3 and AF2NDP4 do a better job of managing multiple priorities than AF2NDP2 does.  I'm hoping that AF2NDP4 with the "Top 3" option will manage priorities well AND help drive tasks to completion more effectively.  So far so good, but as always, time will tell.<br><br>Basically, here's how AF2NDP4 with the recommended priority levels and "Top 3" option works for me:  I have many unstarred tasks which are either low priority or "someday/maybe" items, but I have no need to maintain a separate "someday/maybe" list.  (When I tried this with GTD, the "someday/maybe" items were forgotten forever -- out of sight, out of mind!)  I have a good number of priority tasks with single stars.  These are a mix of medium and high priorities.  I then have the "Top 3" tasks with double stars.  These are generally my top priorities.  Sometimes I have tasks with triple stars -- these are the "drop everything" and "must do today" tasks that need to be finished ASAP.  Since these require additional rewriting and they're very urgent, I'm generally more motivated to try to finish them so I can clear them off the list.<br><br>The interesting thing about the "Top 3" option in AF2NDP4 is that I'm finding that it seems to be just the right amount of focus on top-priority tasks.  Since there are always exactly 3 of these tasks, they cycle frequently and are thus hard to forget, but not constantly.  (The triple-star tasks DO cycle constantly until they're gone!)  Although this does mean that some high priorities are in the single-star list and getting less attention, the fact is that there's only so many ways you can split your attention, and having the "Top 3" cycling frequently seems to work better than having 6-8 high priority tasks cycling more slowly, which doesn't motivate completion the same way.<br><br>When I do finish a "Top 3" task, I need to replace it by promoting another task to that level.  Unless I already know what needs to be done next, I can do a quick scan of the priority tasks to find the best choice, and this "mini-review" helps keep all the other priorities fresh in my mind.  I'll still tend to select a high-priority task as the next "Top 3" task, so it seems that mixing the medium and high priorities together isn't detrimental after all, using this system.  (Occasionally I'm choosing a low or medium priority task for the "Top 3" if I just want it completed soon, and this also works well.)</div>

The stack of cards can be a little unwieldy (especially in my pocket for home tasks), but it works very well because reordering index cards is much easier than rewriting tasks.<br><br>On the other hand, I'm not satisfied with the "Top 3" option that I added to make AF2NDP4, so I'm scratching that and trying a different approach to tweaking AF2NDP3.<br><br>I gave some thought to UTMS:<br><br>     <a href="../blog/The Ultimate Time Management System.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/6/13/the-ultimate-time-management-system.html</a><br><br>I haven't tried it, but UTMS doesn't appeal to me, because it seems to focus too much on clearing the Old List and not enough on current priorities.  As usual, this won't work well with a large list, especially if that list contains "someday/maybe" tasks that may NEVER be done.  I don't want to be required to weed my task list to keep a system functional; I want the system to weed irrelevant tasks naturally (as AF2ND does) and handle even unrealistically large task lists with aplomb.  Since I have a tendency to routinely overcommit myself, I always have too much on my list.  I want a system that can work with me, rather than against me.<br><br>I also considered the "improved" version, UTMSI:<br><br>     <a href="../blog/The Ultimate Time Management System Improved.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/7/2/the-ultimate-time-management-system-improved.html</a><br><br>Unfortunately, UTMSI reintroduces the same sort of compulsion as SuperFocus 3's rules for Column 2, where every task started becomes an obligation to constantly continue working on.  This may work for some people, but it's anathema to me.  The C2 rules in SF3 generated massive resistance for me, and I know that won't work for me personally, especially knowing that many of my old tasks will never be finished.<br><br>But it all got me to thinking.  I did want a tweak to AF2NDP3 to encourage task completion, but I wasn't happy with the "Top 3" rule in practice.  (It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough either, and it was a little awkward in practice.)  I don't want a system like UTMS with such a focus on old tasks, and especially not UTMSI with constant obligations.  Maybe other people would be pleased with them, but it's not what I want in a system.<br><br>The eureka moment was when I asked myself why I would want to use a system that forces me to work on a task that could be completed whenever, when I might have more important things to be working on.  I realized that most of my list consists of "whenever" tasks that may be important, but not urgent or tied to a hard deadline, which gave me an idea.<br><br>This tweak would probably work on FV or any Autofocus variant, but I'm using AF2NDP3 (not AF2NDP4) as the basis for AF2NDP5.  Basically, the tweak is to maintain TWO lists, a Focus list and a Whenever list.  Each list is processed as an AF2NDP3 list, with the following additional rules for managing the lists:<br><br>* Urgent tasks and tasks with a hard deadline should be kept in the Focus list.<br>* Other tasks should generally be kept in the Whenever list, no matter how important.  This includes most new tasks.<br>* A very few (~3 or less) of the other tasks MAY be kept in the Focus list in order to specifically focus on completing those tasks.  (This rule takes the place of the "Top 3" option in AF2NDP4.)<br>* Tasks may be moved between the two lists at will, rewriting the task at the end of the list, but the rules above should be followed.<br>* After taking action on any task, it should generally be rewritten in the same list, but it may be moved to the other list instead.<br>* Start each new day on the Whenever list.  (This is to ensure that this list cannot be neglected entirely.)<br>* After EACH task selected for action from the Whenever list, switch to the Focus list.  (Unless the Focus list is empty, of course.)<br>* Continue to process the Focus list, taking action on tasks until nothing "stands out", then switch back to the Whenever list.<br>* However, at least one task MUST be selected for action before switching lists in either direction, if any tasks in the list are actionable.  (Moving a task from the Whenever list to the Focus list does qualify as selecting the task for action, but a task selected in this way MUST have action taken on it before being moved back to the Whenever list.  Dotting the task as a reminder is a good idea, if action will not be taken immediately.)<br>* For either list, if no task "stands out" on the FIRST pass through the list, search the list for the actionable task with the MOST resistance and select that task for action.  (This is to help break the "motivational surface tension" associated with the task and hopefully reduce procrastination.)<br>* If necessary, minimal action on a task may be to figure out the "next action" for the task, along with a time estimate.  (This is to help with procrastination from not knowing what to do next.)<br><br>Summary of AF2NDP5 rules:<br><br>1. Keep two lists of tasks: a Whenever list containing most tasks and a Focus list containing urgent tasks, tasks with hard deadlines and very few (3 or less) other tasks to focus on completion of those tasks.<br>2. Write all new tasks at the end of the appropriate list, usually the Whenever list.<br>3. Add or remove stars at will to prioritize tasks.<br>4. Every day, start processing with the Whenever list.<br>5. Before selecting a task to work on in a given list, find the oldest unstarred tasks in that list, delete any that are now irrelevant, move any to the other list if desired, then rewrite the oldest relevant task at the end of the list.<br>6. Repeat step 5 for each priority level in use (single-starred, double-starred, etc.).<br>7. Scan backwards from the end of the list for the first task that "stands out" (as in Autofocus), and work on that task for as long as you feel like it.<br>8. If the scan did not find a task that "stands out" AND action has already been taken on a task in this list since last switching lists, switch to the other list and return to step 5.<br>9. Otherwise, if the scan did not find a task that "stands out", search the list for the actionable task with the MOST resistance and work on that task for as long as you feel like it.  (At a minimum, "get out the folder" or determine the "next action" with a time estimate.)<br>10. If the task is finished, delete it. Otherwise, rewrite it at the end of the list.<br>11. If processing the Whenever list, switch to the Focus list.<br>12. Return to step 5.</div>

<div class="content">Note: Unlike AF2NDP4, there are no specific recommended priority levels for AF2NDP5; use whatever priority levels are convenient or necessary -- or just use all unstarred tasks and don't prioritize at all, if you don't feel the need.</div>

<div class="content">I think it's interesting that you've chosen to split things between a "focus" list and a "whenever" list.   I've been thinking along the same lines lately.<br><br>However, in the spirit of Mark Forster's "current initiative" idea and Peter Drucker's "do first things first and second things not at all" maxim, I've been trying to think through what is the SINGLE most important objective I have right now -- task or project or initiative or whatever you want to call it -- the single thing that really needs my extended focus right now.   And that becomes my single item for Focus.<br><br>Everything else still needs to be dealt with -- like Mark says, the "unimportant" things have a way of asserting their importance when neglected!   But it can be handled during random time, during tired time, during snippets between time.   It can also be handled with GTD "contexts".   <br>But "focus" time just doesn't happen at all, if I have it mixed up with everything else on a list, or if my time could go to either "focus" tasks or "whenever" tasks.   I have to be more conscious about the "focus" tasks.<br><br>I've run into this same basic idea in many places in the last couple of weeks:<br><br>Stever Robbins talked about it in his podcast - from overload to clarity - <a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/organization/schedule-overload-clarity" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/organization/schedule-overload-clarity</a><br><br>It is a main feature in Brian P Moran's book, The 12 Week Year - <a href="http://12weekyear.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://12weekyear.com/</a>  and  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-ebook/dp/B00CU9P31K" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-ebook/dp/B00CU9P31K</a><br><br>Peter Drucker advocates this approach in The Effective Executive - summary at <a href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~prewett/writings/BookReviews/TheEffectiveExecutive.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~prewett/writings/BookReviews/TheEffectiveExecutive.html</a></div>

<div class="content">This alternation between "focus" and "whenever" also appears in Nicholas Taleb's book, Antifragile ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile:_Things_That_Gain_from_Disorder" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile:_Things_That_Gain_from_Disorder</a> ).    I was scouring that books to see if he tried to apply his antifragility ideas to time management, and in fact, he did (but not very thoroughly).   He suggested taking an "apophatic" approach - he quotes Steve Jobs as follows:<br><br>"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on.  But that’s not what it means at all.  It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.  I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done.  Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things."<br><br>Taleb elaborates by saying that charlatans always give advice about WHAT TO DO.   "Ten steps to achieve all your goals" and stuff like that.   Whereas experts are more focused on what NOT to do.   When driving a car, learn the few things you must know to avoid 99% of accidental collisions.    When playing chess, make sure you don't lose pieces and eventually you will win.   When investing, it's imperative to control risk, not so much to chase opportunity.   Etc.<br><br>In light of these comments, I found it interesting that so many TM systems are based on "universal capture" -- from GTD to AF1 and most of Mark's systems.   You end up with a complete list of ALL the things you could POSSIBLY do that has any relevance at all to your needs and desires.   Maybe you will apply rules to prune this down or focus it or make it more timely or whatever.   But still, the approach is "capture everything".    I think Taleb's approach would be more to "discard everything" and only do what you are really compelled to do, either by the necessities of life, or by your deepest personal drives and aspirations.   <br><br>A standout among Mark's systems is SMEMA - it's the opposite of "universal capture", and seems to line up with Taleb's philosophy a lot more than other systems that involve universal capture.   I gave up using it because I felt a need for more structure, but it did always give a feel of being more "natural" than all these systems we invent for ourselves, and it always did produce a lot of results that seemed to really matter.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim: Trust me, SMEMA comboed with DIT is excellent.  It gives SMEMA needed structure while still retaining SMEMA's power.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>The idea behind allowing "a very few" other tasks into the Focus list was so you could put a "current initiative" or "Top 3" in there to focus on completion of those, but even that is optional.  It should work find with only urgent tasks and hard deadlines in the Focus list.  (Or an empty Focus list, if there are none!)<br><br>If you can answer "yes" to the question "Can this slide if necessary?", then the task belongs in the Whenever list, unless it's one of the "very few" that you want to focus on.  The idea behind the Focus list is to use it for the things that must be done ASAP.<br><br>I very much believe in "universal capture", it's a very helpful thing.  However, it inherently means you'll capture much that will never be done, because we'll always think of more things than we have time to actually do.  Mark's systems often have some form of "dismissal" which always felt pretty arbitrary to me.  I'd rather delete tasks consciously, when I realize that I no longer care about doing them, or acknowledge that they'll never happen even if I want them to.  That's why I liked nuntym's "no dismissal" approach with AF2ND.  With that approach, I decide what gets removed from my list, not the rules of a system.<br><br>Rather than aggressively deleting things from my list and possibly getting rid of a task I should have kept, I'd rather have a system that can handle any number of non-priority tasks without getting bogged down, and just let my intuition guide me on when to delete them.  AF2NDP2 through AF2NDP5 have all worked well, and all of them can handle the "vast wasteland" just fine because of the prioritization feature.<br><br>I've only been using AF2NDP5 for a few days now, but I'm very happy with it.  I do prefer using it with index cards so I can shuffle cards rather than rewriting, but either is fine.</div>

<div class="content">Minor change: I think I'd like to rename the "Whenever" list to the "Main" list, which betters captures the intent of the list.  It's not meant to be a "Someday/Maybe" list, but the primary list where most tasks go, including important ones.  (That's what the prioritization is for, after all.)</div>
