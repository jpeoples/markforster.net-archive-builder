<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>It would appear that with Autofocus it might be possible to accept many more commitments (e.g Clients or extra projects) that one may be able to do properly or in a timely manner - a la GTD? <br><br>Obviously DIT features an Audit for this purpose. What are your thoughts re Autofocus, Commitments and Audits? Are you going to ask me to use my intution? I suppose that may be the purpose of hilighting and cancelling tasks that one has decided not to do. But what if you have already accepted the commitment?</div>

<div class="content">Surely if the number of active pages you're working with keeps on growing and growing wouldn't that tell both the rational and the instinctual sides of your brain that something was wrong?</div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br>There's no doubt in my mind that Autofocus enables one to do a much higher volume of work than DIT (can't comment on GTD). The "dismissal" of tasks under Autofocus takes the place of the audit in DIT. If you overload yourself with commitments you will find that some of them will keep getting rejected. These should be the ones that are least important to your current values and vision.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and Hannah, <br><br>Thanks for your comments, which has helped me clarify my thoughts. In my short time with AF I agree that my productivity has increased - a lot of tasks and potential projects are becoming unstuck. <br><br>I treated  the DIT feature of being able to carry out an Audit on experiencing a specific trigger, i.e not keeping up with my work for 3 days as a Safety Net and self preservation strategy! I work in a culture that will just keep piling the jobs on if you let them! Conversely the approach in AF seems a bit open ended really. How many open pages should I have before I realize I'm overcommited? I suppose it's an Intuition thing but I'm worried I may take on a bunch of Clients (I'm a Therapist working in a fast turnover setting) and my ability to work efficiently in managing their care may be compromised or the care process take longer than it need to.</div>

<div class="content">I currently have 14 open pages and I don't feel in the least overcommitted. I find the number varies all the time.<br><br>By the way it is impossible to have more open pages than you have lines on a page.</div>

<div class="content">Leon<br><br>Would it be possible to check/estimate how many clients felt comfortable with DIT and keep to approximately that number with Autofocus? Although every task gets put on the list there are obviously going to other places we keep paperwork, (client) lists, etc. so I wondered if there was some other way you would be able to keep an eye on how much work you're taking on.<br><br>Good luck</div>

<div class="content">Surely if you dump a vast number of actions into your book you could have as many active pages as you want?  This might be particularly true when copying all of your actions over from a previous system.<br><br>Note also that for a given number of new tasks, the fewer the lines per page, the more active pages you will suddenly have!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Richard, would you mind clarifying your post for me please? As I don't quite get your point...Are you saying this is a positive or a negative? Thanks in anticipation.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, you wrote above  <br>'By the way it is impossible to have more open pages than you have lines on a page.'<br><br>Am I missing something in the method?  <br>How does the number of open pages relate to lines on a page?  <br><br>Otherwise so far so good.  A few issues and concerns but will keep working through it for a few more days and reading the excellent comments and questions. <br><br>Regards</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>You're right and I'm wrong. What I was thinking was that at the minimum rate of one item per pass, the maximum number of passes a page could last for would be the same as the number of lines. That's correct, but somehow my mind jumped to thinking that there would only be one new page per pass, which is of course incorrect.<br><br>Glad it's going well for you otherwise.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark and everyone else for your  many comments and support not only with Autofocus but with DIT also. Mark I have big respect for the way you conduct yourself on your site.<br><br>My intuition is telling me to do the 80:20 thing here. So I'm going to go off now for 2 weeks (review date written in my diary) and throw everything at Autofocus just by concentrating on the quick start guide and instructions. Obviously I will get instruction updates as I'm registered. <br><br>I beieve that after this point I will be in a better position to form an independent evaluation. <br><br>Thanks again.</div>
