<div class="content">As each day of 2014 is already occupied by me doing something or other on each of those days now seems a good time to decide and then act according to what sort of person I'm going to be in 2014. If I'm going to use the year ahead differently from 2013 then I should decide what sort of changes I need to make in me. So, I imagine my best future self writing a blog post to me...<br><br>...<br><br>Decide to act-as-if you can be the kind of man you prefer. Maintain that decision and act accordingly. You don't have a fixed personality. That's a myth. <br><br>Balance. What type of things are going on your list? Creative, fun, frivolous pleasures and new things to try should be on your list. (oh, and put forgiveness reminders of yourself on there for all the times you judge yourself harshly).<br><br>Maximise your access to possibilities. Pause when you review the list. look at the list from a high perspective with calm emotions. Aim for a flow-state, ease, grace. The list allows exploration. All possible reactions and outcomes to any situation exist from each moment. Be open to the possibilities all around you.  (If it helps, imagine a round room with doors of different colours, shapes, sizes).<br><br>Use natural -will, be led by enthusiasm. Follow what stands out; allow for inspiration and intuition to guide, probably based on a feeling of natural excitement or enthusiasm.<br><br>Dissipate anxiety. Let go of "In order to do something I have to be sure how it's going to work out". When planning becomes an attempt at certainty it's gone too far. Which step CAN you be on? (Anxiety comes from thinking about the 10th step and reaching for certainty about outcomes. Breaking the steps down dissipates anxiety).<br><br>Movement (action) trumps waiting to feel motivated or analysing to get the perfect solution. Your brain cannot give you the full story. "I can't control and think my way out of this". I've reached a ceiling. Baby-steps will move the energy of the situation, and in you.<br><br>Have a flexible relationship to time: a non–clock relation to time. Not having a life driven by the clock, but being in clarity about options in the moment, can stretch time. If it seems your clock has stopped, it means that your experience of the clock has changed. If you’re not attached to it dictating to you what you have to do (as an authority figure), you view time from a different perspective. You have had a rigid relationship to time in order to feel safe and certain. That's not always helpful.<br><br>Thanks future me.<br><br>...<br><br>We are often forcing ourselves to be doing things, using coffee to stimulate us, berating ourselves for not getting more done, feeling guilty over what we failed to achieve or become. I will use the above principles in 2014 to remedy that.<br><br>"...a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness of work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work." - Bertrand Russell (<a href="http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html)</a></div>

<div class="content">michael:<br> <br>Brilliant article, thank you for posting it. I recommend everyone read it through to the end. It gets better as it goes along. <br><br>It reminds me of the longest-lived and leisurely people of Ikaria, Greece and Tim Ferris's The Four-Hour Workweek. <br><br>A few months ago I looked into average workweeks around the world and how health and happiness correlated. I discovered that the healthiest happiest populations work on average 20-25 hours a week, 4-5 hours a day.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>"I didn't find anything valuable in that article, to be honest. What did you see in it?"<br><br><br>I'll excerpt my favorite remarks:<br><br>"...the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work."<br><br>"Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times leisure for the few was only rendered possible by the labors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is good."<br><br>"The war showed conclusively that, by the scientific organization of production, it is possible to keep modern populations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the modern world. If, at the end of the war, the scientific organization, which had been created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work, had been preserved, and the hours of the week had been cut down to four, all would have been well. Instead of that the old chaos was restored, those whose work was demanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as unemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in proportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as exemplified by his industry."<br><br>"Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?"<br><br>"If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day, there would be enough for everybody and no unemployment — assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are well off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners, except as the grim punishment of unemployment; in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons."<br><br>"The wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and education. A man who has worked long hours all his life will become bored if he becomes suddenly idle. But without a considerable amount of leisure a man is cut off from many of the best things. There is no longer any reason why the bulk of the population should suffer this deprivation; only a foolish asceticism, usually vicarious, makes us continue to insist on work in excessive quantities now that the need no longer exists."<br><br>"In the West, we have various ways of dealing with this problem. We have no attempt at economic justice, so that a large proportion of the total produce goes to a small minority of the population, many of whom do no work at all. Owing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts of things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working population idle, because we can dispense with their labor by making the others overwork. When all these methods prove inadequate, we have a war: we cause a number of people to manufacture high explosives, and a number of others to explode them, as if we were children who had just discovered fireworks. By a combination of all these devices we manage, though with difficulty, to keep alive the notion that a great deal of severe manual work must be the lot of the average man."<br><br>"...the rational solution would be, as soon as the necessaries and elementary comforts can be provided for all, to reduce the hours of labor gradually, allowing a popular vote to decide, at each stage, whether more leisure or more goods were to be preferred. But, having taught the supreme virtue of hard work, it is difficult to see how the authorities can aim at a paradise in which there will be much leisure and little work. It seems more likely that they will find continually fresh schemes, by which present leisure is to be sacrificed to future productivity. ...This sort of thing, if it happens, will be the result of regarding the virtue of hard work as an end in itself, rather than as a means to a state of affairs in which it is no longer needed."<br><br>"The fact is that moving matter about, while a certain amount of it is necessary to our existence, is emphatically not one of the ends of human life. If it were, we should have to consider every navy superior to Shakespeare. We have been misled in this matter by two causes. One is the necessity of keeping the poor contented, which has led the rich, for thousands of years, to preach the dignity of labor, while taking care themselves to remain undignified in this respect. The other is the new pleasure in mechanism, which makes us delight in the astonishingly clever changes that we can produce on the earth's surface. Neither of these motives makes any great appeal to the actual worker. If you ask him what he thinks the best part of his life, he is not likely to say: 'I enjoy manual work because it makes me feel that I am fulfilling man's noblest task, and because I like to think how much man can transform his planet. It is true that my body demands periods of rest, which I have to fill in as best I may, but I am never so happy as when the morning comes and I can return to the toil from which my contentment springs.' I have never heard working men say this sort of thing. They consider work, as it should be considered, a necessary means to a livelihood, and it is from their leisure that they derive whatever happiness they may enjoy."<br><br>"There was formerly a capacity for light-heartedness and play which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its own sake."<br><br>"It is this divorce between the individual and the social purpose of production that makes it so difficult for men to think clearly in a world in which profit-making is the incentive to industry."<br><br>"One result is that we attach too little importance to enjoyment and simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the pleasure that it gives to the consumer."<br><br>"When I suggest that working hours should be reduced to four, I am not meaning to imply that all the remaining time should necessarily be spent in pure frivolity. I mean that four hours' work a day should entitle a man to the necessities and elementary comforts of life, and that the rest of his time should be his to use as he might see fit."<br><br>"The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken up with work; if they had more leisure, they would again enjoy pleasures in which they took an active part."<br><br>"University life is so different from life in the world at large that men who live in academic milieu tend to be unaware of the preoccupations and problems of ordinary men and women; moreover their ways of expressing themselves are usually such as to rob their opinions of the influence that they ought to have upon the general public. Another disadvantage is that in universities studies are organized, and the man who thinks of some original line of research is likely to be discouraged. Academic institutions, therefore, useful as they are, are not adequate guardians of the interests of civilization in a world where everyone outside their walls is too busy for unutilitarian pursuits."<br><br>"In a world where no one is compelled to work more than four hours a day, every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every painter will be able to paint without starving, however excellent his pictures may be. Young writers will not be obliged to draw attention to themselves by sensational pot-boilers, with a view to acquiring the economic independence needed for monumental works, for which, when the time at last comes, they will have lost the taste and capacity."<br><br>"Above all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves, weariness, and dyspepsia. The work exacted will be enough to make leisure delightful, but not enough to produce exhaustion. Since men will not be tired in their spare time, they will not demand only such amusements as are passive and vapid. At least one per cent will probably devote the time not spent in professional work to pursuits of some public importance, and, since they will not depend upon these pursuits for their livelihood, their originality will be unhampered..."<br><br>"But it is not only in these exceptional cases that the advantages of leisure will appear. Ordinary men and women, having the opportunity of a happy life, will become more kindly and less persecuting and less inclined to view others with suspicion. The taste for war will die out, partly for this reason, and partly because it will involve long and severe work for all. Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world needs most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life of arduous struggle. Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have overwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines; in this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish forever."</div>

<div class="content">If you want to work four hours per day instead of eight, and adjust your lifestyle to match, what is stopping you?   Are you waiting for someone to give you permission?    Why?<br><br>Regarding those pin-makers...   This is a problem I've pondered for a long time.   The question is explored in Marshall Brain's short story, "Manna" ( <a href="http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm</a> ).   Russell and Brain share a common theme:  the elite have created a power structure that causes all power, wealth, and prosperity to flow to themselves, while they allow, with indifference or malice, everyone else to labor and suffer.  I would agree with that assessment of the state of things in the world, to some degree, and if that is Russell's point, then I'd agree with him.  <br><br>However, we differ in the way we frame the problem, and thus we differ in our solutions.   Russell proposes that the Elite must change the system – he repeatedly calls for a centralized solution, a systemic shake-up:  “the way we deal with the situation” as a society, as a whole, must be changed; otherwise no solution is forthcoming.  And in all his examples, it’s the Elite themselves who must initiate and carry out the change.   The Elite must changes the rules, they must allow everyone else to have a fair share of the goods.  But ultimately it’s still the Elite who run things.   He seems to take that as a given.   <br><br>Brain ultimately falls into the same trap.   In the beginning, it’s the Elite who own the robots who oppress the common people and derive all benefit from the prosperity brought on by the robotic workers.   But when the protagonists escape from the Elite prisons and arrive in the robotic “paradise”, is it really as ideal as it seems?   Half the population lives in a virtual reality ultimately controlled and defined by the robots.   Nearly the whole population could be living in a virtual reality and not even know it.   And in the “real” world, it’s still the robots who define and enforce all the “rules”, and “re-educate” the ones who violate the rules.  I think we’ve seen this movie before…   <br><br>I would challenge the underlying presupposition, that changing society requires a top-down power structure to bring about and enforce the change.   <br><br>Reading authors like Solzhenitsyn and others who endured life under a crushing regime, one finds a common theme.   Ultimately, people discover that they really are free, no matter what the paradigm or framework imposed upon them by the State or the Elite, no matter what kind of Gulag they make people suffer in.   There may be rules and laws and societal norms.   The State and the Elite can never transcend that, and allow a person to find true freedom.   The State and the Elite can only change the rules to pretty-up the prison.   But they still write the rules, and it’s still a prison.    <br><br>The only real solution is for the individual person to realize that he or she is already free.   Free to think, free to envision, free to respond to the situation where one finds oneself, free to craft one’s own solutions, free to keep to one’s own integrity, rather than always deferring to the rule of the prevailing paradigm.   And then one finds that the only real prison is one’s own mental framework, one's own sins and passions, one's own habits and predispositions.   But one also has the freedom to change these.   <br><br><br>Back to the pin-makers…    So, what should they do when they are thrown out of work, because someone has invented a new machine, and now their work is no longer valuable?   The inventor’s labor brings about a superabundance of pins, making them available and accessible and cheap for everyone, thus increasing prosperity for everyone.   But the unemployed workers demand to keep this prosperity for themselves, demand to hold onto their former rank and privilege as the exclusive manufacturers of pins.   In a way, they want to become their own little Elite!  They feel themselves entitled to the fruit of the inventor’s labor, tears, risks, failures, and suffering that ultimately led to the invention of the new machine, even though they did not share in any of those hardships.   If they have a taste for political reform, they might promote socialism, and say that everyone should share equally in the fruit of everyone’s labors, thus establishing a universal Elite that preys off everybody, in which everyone feels entitled to whatever scraps of wealth and prosperity remain, but nobody feels responsible for creating anything of value.   <br><br>But that’s not the way it has to be.   <br><br>Perhaps the unemployed pin-makers can learn from the reality of the situation:  there is no trade on earth that has permanent value, and one should never expect or demand this.   But there is always a way that a person can create something of value – either of value to oneself, or of value to others.   And this is probably one of the most useful skills to have:  to always improve one’s ability to create something of value.<br><br>Russell would certainly object to this.  It is dangerously close to asserting that “work is a virtue” – which he derides.   I suppose we just have a fundamental difference of opinion on the nature of work.   I don’t see work merely as “re-arranging material in space”.   Instead, I see work as “creating something of value for myself or for others”.   It’s a lot more interesting and fulfilling to think of work in this way.   It also makes work seem a lot less like work.   <br><br>Perhaps not everyone has the time or inclination to be entrepreneurial, to always be reinventing oneself, to always be finding new ways to create value.   What can people do, if they are in that situation?    Maybe we just need a better way for the “common man” to participate in the endeavors of the inventor and the entrepreneur.  Sharing in the risk, they are then entitled to a share of the rewards.   Maybe we need more innovations like kickstarter.com and kiva.org   By sharing in the risk and labor of the entrepreneur, a person can keep oneself mentally in tune with how wealth and prosperity are actually created – through managed risk-taking, through trial and error, through experimentation and failure, through heartache and exhilaration.  A society of such people freely participating in shared wealth creation would be attuned to creating more and more value, more wealth and prosperity for all – not just as the passive Elite who feel entitled to this, but as active participants and owners of the process. <br><br>Russell's article doesn’t offer any solutions of this sort.  He just seems to be coming up with new ways to re-organize the prisoners in their cells.</div>

<div class="content">Wow. There is so much of substance in this thread already. It will take time and thought to digest.<br><br>My immediate reaction is to think of hunter-gatherers supposedly meeting their material needs on 4 hours 'work' a day; of Tim Ferriss's 4- hour week; of the bizarre way in whvih labour-saving devices seem simply to transfer labour elsewhere rather than free up time for leisure or art or craft or charity or adventure.<br><br>But what then of practice? How can I apply any of this? <br><br>Is it all just a dream? Can industrial or post-industrial society based on employers and employees actually allow for a more even distribution of leisure & material comfort, while balancing 'work' in the traditional sense with other useful 'non-work' endeavour and enterprise?<br><br>Or to put it bluntly, how do I actually live a worthwhle and satisfying life, in a world of jobs and offices?  I work in an office for 40 hours a week at a job. It does not feel to my soul like what I was born to do. But while my mortgage and my wife and my children may sympathise with me, they all need feeding and look to me for that. <br><br>Too many gossamer threads tie me down.

<div class="content">Oh, no! I don't really have to read that article by Bertrand Russell, do I? <br><br>Elitist isn't quite strong enough a word for him. He was the great grandson of a duke, the grandson of a former prime minister, born the son of a viscount and succeeded to an earldom in 1931.<br><br>I long ago learned that most of his writings sounded as if he was addressing retarded children (which is no doubt how he regarded ordinary human beings like us) and invariably came to conclusions that were utter nonsense.<br><br>So I'm going to pass on this discussion.

<div class="content">The way I see it, the missing piece to Russell's conundrum is provided by philosopher/economist Henry George, a contemporary of Mark Twain's who was popular in his day and enjoyed Twain's hearty support but has unfortunately fallen out of the mainstream. I highly recommend his work _Progress and Poverty_.<br><br>Progress and Poverty, by Henry George<br><a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/pcontents.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.henrygeorge.org/pcontents.htm</a><br><br>I'm afraid there's not much here for individuals to act on in present society, but for those interested in economics, it provides a bold, novel premise developed with rigor by a brilliant man.</div>

<div class="content">Oh, no, not Georgism!<br><br>I once belonged to a discussion group that had been taken over by Georgists - it wasn't what the actual subject was supposed to be.

<div class="content">While active in local politics (long time ago), I came across Georgists every so often and couldn't make much sense of them. I finally read Progress & Poverty last year and was pleasantly surprised. I think modern Georgists have added quite a spin to George's original ideas, and perhaps few have read his actual writings, making them quite like the adherents of most other movements I've come into contact with.<br><br>Georgists aside, Henry George's Progress & Poverty is an excellent work of first-rate scholarship. It is too bad that it's nearly impossible to sum up his ideas without making him sound like some sort of half-baked Communist. He is nothing of the sort. You might say his economics are like non-Euclidean geometry: remove one postulate, rebuild everything else, and see what you get. I should say "replace" one postulate.<br><br>Anyway, if at least one person enjoys that book, then my work here is done.</div>

<div class="content">Great! I find his analysis of land value to be solid, though one can doubt the practicality of his proposed solution via property tax. After some thought, I decided that his proposal is no more impractical than many modern regimes we take for granted, such as our intellectual property laws. Ultimately, none of them work unless most of the culture buys into them. Like an AF variation, we'll never really know how this type of land policy works until we try it—until some culture accepts it and tries it ... not in our lifetimes!</div>

<div class="content">I've been trying to understand Henry George's basic idea.   Is this summary correct?<br><br>- Land should be held as the common property of all.<br>- To implement this idea, private parties hold title to the land, but they must pay a tax based on the value of the undeveloped land (no tax on the improvements to the land).<br>- This tax should be the only tax in a society - all other taxes can be eliminated. <br>- This setup gives an incentive to the people who hold title to the land to make the most productive use possible with it, and not merely hold it for speculative purposes.<br><br>Is that an accurate summary of the basis of the theory?</div>

<div class="meta">2013-12-28 3:14</div>
<div class="content">Seraphim, that sounds like an accurate summary of his *proposal*, but I find the brilliant part of his work to be his recognition and analysis of land value and how it interacts with other elements in a free market. He lays bare, with solid analysis, the reasons behind the vicious cycle referred to by Bertrand Russell earlier in this thread. His career was devoted to answering the question, "Why does our economic progress seem to put us on an ever-accelerating treadmill, and pockets of extreme poverty (slums), rather than giving us all a life of ever-increasing leisure?" Now, it is true that we have much more leisure than many of our ancestors, but anthropologists tell us that primitive man worked much less than we do. There is something about organizing for agricultural/industrial purposes that changes things.<br><br>When I read Russell's essay, which I did in its entirety and which I enjoyed despite disagreeing with many of his particular exhortations, it occurred to me that Henry George's analysis explains logically and economically many of Russell's complaints.<br><br>George's suggestion of a specific approach to land ownership and taxation should be taken as version 1.0 of a solution. Like all great thinkers, he has given us enduring principles and analysis, plus a first cut at a real-world application. If we were to follow his ideas and implement his land tax, we would undoubtedly find trouble right away and in fixing it arrive at something better. As we succeeded more and more, his original solution would look naive even though his thinking would remain the underpinning of our policies.<br><br>That is my take on Henry George.</div>

<div class="meta">2013-12-29 12:39</div>
<div class="content">This is based on my memories of the long and tedious discussions I had with Georgists many years ago, so may be entirely wrong:<br><br>If I remember correctly, the land-tax is ultimately intended to be at 100% of the notional income off the underlying unimproved value of the land, i.e. if the land is valued at £1,000,000 and current interest rates are at 10% the tax will be £100,000 p.a.<br><br>My question was always "How do you arrive at the underlying value of the land?" Their answer was that it would be arrived at by a team of valuers.<br><br>I pointed out that valuers base their valuations on actual prices attained on the free market, and that their tax would have destroyed the free market so there was nothing to base the valuations on. It was then that they started to get huffy.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, those were exactly my concerns also.   I didn't understand how the mechanics of this proposal would work.   "Value" is arbitrary unless determined by the free exchange of free people.  <br><br>If there is a tax based on real property values (based on market value), I don't see how it would achieve the results that George envisions.   I don't really see how it's that much different from property tax systems already in place all over the USA.<br><br>Bernie, can you summarize "his recognition and analysis of land value and how it interacts with other elements in a free market" and how it addresses so many issues?   I've started reading the book, but find it very long-winded, even the "modernized" version, and am having a hard time getting to the meat inside the nut.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim and Mark, your reservations about land "value" were exactly the same as mine. George did not have any such rigid formula as what Mark quoted above, based on the current interest rate and so forth (at least not in this book). Any such formula has been cooked up by George's modern "followers." It has been about a year since I read the book, but I think George essentially said that the tax authority would have the same challenge of setting a "price" (tax) for the land as a landlord has in setting rent, that if a given parcel of land was not moving, then it would need to be marked down before anyone would rent it. In other words, the local tax authority would have to participate in the market just like anyone else. If the entire city and residential areas were overpriced, well it would soon become a ghost town or perhaps a haven of the rich—and what's wrong with that, if that's the kind of town they want? A national system of setting all the rents centrally would of course never work. George's idea was strictly local and depends on competition between various sites for various uses. He does not mention zoning either; I suspect he would let the market decide the best use for a parcel of land based on the best rent it would fetch from various buyers.<br><br>What the new reader may not appreciate is that the "value of the land" according to George is something you can discover only in the marketplace, and that it is created by the people who live around the land (hence the principle that those people deserve a stake in it). I.e., land in New York City is so valuable, not because of some gold mine under the earth or some special river that runs through it, etc., but because of the people who live there and all the clever and helpful things they are doing for each other, even the ones with low stations in life. But that is not to be confused with the skyscrapers and so forth that were built by specific people, because their values *are* due to those specific people. If those people left, the land would become worthless overnight. Also, one must realize that "Land" means anything not created or unearthed by the labor of people, including the air we are breathing, but not including gold dug up from the ground (since that requires work and materials).<br><br>I am treading on dangerous ground here, that I said I would not tread on, because as I indicated, it is extremely hard to sum this up to a modern reader without making it appear collectivist. I assure you, there is no element of collectivism in Henry George's thought, and his modern "followers" who justify various public enterprises are ignoring his own direct words and making up their own wishful agenda. There were several places in this book where George made that absolutely clear.<br><br>For what it's worth, I am an "Austrian" free-market advocate and, for a layman, well read on that topic. George's work is the only thing I've come across in 17 years (since discovering the Austrians) that has made me feel the need to amend their thought in any way. Where I find myself now is something like a non-Euclidean geometer. When I come across the usual discussions of flat triangles and non-intersecting parallel lines, etc., I do not *disagree*, as it is all perfectly correct for a flat plane, but in some circumstances I have to add an asterisk that our planet is actually round. I found some Austrian Georgists on the web at one point, so there is a synthesis out there if you're interested.<br><br>George's starting point is the simple moral observation that no one made the land, hence no one can own it. But we all morally own the fruits of our own labor which we have added to the land. I know we Western free-marketeers don't want to hear it, and we are naturally afraid of taking such a discussion seriously, but that's how important ideas come about. It was a challenge for me to let George "speak his mind" to me but well worth it. George goes back to Locke et al and the proposition that we "own" the land when we mix our labor with it, and he shows why this can't be morally right and truly is not workable in practice—that the way we have traditionally applied it is not even consistent on its own terms (I claim this whole continent for Spain, see my flag ...). He asks the resulting questions and proceeds from there. It is brilliant work, and I can assure any Right-thinking Free-market Westerner that there is no need to fear, simply let it be and read on. He is as libertarian as they come. His system ends up even more robust than conventional Austrians, for its purported ability to address poverty. (Purported! Alas, it's never been tested.)<br><br>So there I go half-explaining it again.<br><br>In any case, if you like reading economics books, then I recommend George's _Progress & Poverty_, and I predict that it will be not what you think and will make a lot more sense than you would imagine. If I'm wrong, then you'll acquire yet another reason to believe steadfastly in whatever you currently believe. If you're not interested in economics and not employed in land policy, do NOT read this book!<br><br>Alan, to get more out AF in 2014, I recommend writing "Read Henry George's Progress & Poverty" in your notebook and then promptly crossing it off.   ;)</div>

<div class="content">Okay, here is a much more concise version, tying it to this THREAD's prior content:<br><br>* Bertrand Russell decries the tendency of "progress" to create a modern treadmill, leaving many of us (relatively) poor and unsatisfied.<br><br>* Henry George analyzed a certain cycle of poverty in which the dynamic power of free markets is hijacked by land policy and flows disproportionately to land owners, leaving slums in its wake. Much to the modern reader's skepticism, he does so without an iota of collectivism.<br><br>* Austrians exposed the business cycle in a free market, similarly showing how the dynamic power of free markets is hijacked by central monetary policy.<br><br>* Various modern "third way" economic policies exist because of a perception that free markets have not delivered all that they should have.<br><br>I submit, then, that Henry George addresses Russell's complaints in a wholly non-collectivist manner; that Austrians and Georgists can get along just fine, and that anyone who especially liked or especially disliked Russell's essay would find much of interest in Henry George, if they were into that sort of thing.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>I live in the state with the highest property tax in the nation.  The average tax bill in 2012 was $7,885.  We also have exceptionally high auto insurance and health insurance premiums.  Our governor is tied as the 5th highest paid state in the nation yet....we're ranked as the 47th worst run state with the highest unemployment rate.  His personal property tax bill was almost $37K.  That's a yearly salary to some people!  LOL!  The NJ dept equals almost $30K per resident.<br>I'm one of the few people I know of who's not receiving some kind of state aide or "tax loophole break".  What the hell?  LOL!  btw, I just got slapped with a tax bill with a $1,000 fine that I paid for on.....Sept 18,2006!  Of course, I saved the check and all the documents but still....I'm sick of the taxes and the crappy way they run things.  We have a very high tourist revenue stream and MANY out of state and national headquarters here... yet 81% of tax revenue is paid by the residents.  Somethings fishy.....LOL!  I'm living testimony that relying too heavily on land tax revenue has serious disadvantages for disabled and retirees.  You work for decades to be successful and then your property tax and other related  horribly inflated expenses from living in your home town decreases your spendable income.  Unless you can bring in at least a couple 100K per year in retirement, our quality of life is going downhill fast.  <br>Nah....vote me nay for relying on property tax as the means of state and or federal revenue.</div>

<div class="content">Bernie - Thanks for the detailed explanation.  I am also coming from an Austrian and libertarian point of view, and am also intrigued by George's works.   But I've also struggled with some tenets of the classical Austrian and libertarian viewpoints that seem to disregard obvious inter-dependencies in the human experience that challenge a pure "I own all the fruit of my labor" thesis. <br><br>So, the so-called "collectivism" doesn't bother me.   The thing that does bother me is I can't figure out the mechanism George is proposing for determining the raw value of the land, as opposed to the developed value.   How does a free market decide which portion of the total value is the "raw" value, and which portion is the "developed" value?   <br><br>I haven't read the whole book - I don't have time right now - but I've been skimming it, trying to see where he addresses this question.   It seems his whole proposal rests on this point.   Can you summarize this, or point me in the right direction?<br><br>Once I get a firm grasp of what he is actually proposing in regard to land valuation, maybe I'll be able to understand the deeper points of his thesis and how his proposal would work.  But I keep getting stuck on that, and as a result I find the whole thing rather incomprehensible.<br><br>Thanks very much!!</div>

<div class="content">i havent read George, but two points seem to combine to address your issue:<br>1. land valuation is set by local authorities<br>2. one property and another have the same inherent value, excepting particular natural resources present.<br><br>So a town will tax per square foot, and categorize properties such as riverfront to be worth more.<br><br>Going beyond this point though, we also have services like roads and water.  Is it allowable to tax one area higher in exchange for better road construction?  At minimum there will be zoning and taxation per zone.  Industry requires concrete paving and/or wider roads.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan B<br>I think a lot of the land valuation is arbitrary crappola.  My property tax has increased over 500% in 10 years.  I don't have a private dock or boat slip. The marina is 6-7 minutes away.  I've made NO improvements.  It's entirely residential zoning.  4 blocks away they're paying about 1/3 as much only because they've deemed our few blocks more exclusive.  That's bull!  Everything is the same. Even my neighbors are the same.  They know that we can take the squeeze to make up for all the people who can't.  Our unemployment rate is the highest in the nation. They simply decided that our property is worth 5 times as much to fill their coffers.  One year it rose over 60%.  Also they've upped our medicare advantage premiums available in our particular county to astronomical rates because they have to subsidize all those on medicaide.  I don't have any fancy business loopholes.  I'm going to be priced out of my neighborhood.  There has been an exodus of seniors leaving the state who want to live in a nice come near the bay and ocean and have a bit of disposable income. I have many friends living in the next state because of this even though they've lived here for decades.  I'll stay stubborn for awhile longer.  It's been stable for 2 years.....fingers crossed!<br><br>Bottom line: It's B.S.  If they know you have the money, they'll gouge you over and over where it matters most. Your home, your healthcare and your investments.</div>

<div class="content">Obamacare: My medicare advantage plan premium rose to 250% higher than 2013.  I jumped ship and took a more reasonabily priced plan.  Two of my more unscrupulous acquaintances hid their bucks from state and federal government view  and get the plan I had for free because Obamacare said that they're eligable for medicade assistance.  I can't bring myself to do that. They can buy an $85K car with cash yet they get medicade and food card because they know how to hide their assets.  Dumb honest me gets kicked in the arse. They don't feel any guilt at all!  They whip out that food card after coming back from a trip to the Cayman Islands to "tap" an account because their 2 year old Mercedes is looking a bit ragged.....GEEZ!  ....and they call me a sucker because I should have done what they do.  No, thanks.  I'll pass.....</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>Thank you so much for that!  People tell me to be grateful that I'm doing better than many people.  I say, Hell to!  I lost a couple of decades of earning power because a truck hit me.  I always worked very hard and put in tons of extra hours to better myself.  I didn't win a lottery ticket!  LOL!  It doubly galls me that unscrupulous and/or life long unambitious people are getting the policy that I got priced of……grrrr.  It's not just Obamacare.  It's my state also.  Those oafs get their food card yet probably spend far more than that just eating and drinking out one or two days.<br><br>My question. How come the state and Feds don't notice that they claim to have assets less than $3K yet their quarterly property tax bill is probably much more.  Why don't their luxury cars and boat insurance premiums raise any red flags? There are probably other obvious clues that I'm not thinking of.  I truly believe that they are purposely turning a blind eye for some reason.  They've tried to sting me more than once and I'm totally honest but always had to go through the anxiety of the process of proving it. I'm erroneously raising red flags yet the obvious crooks just sail under the radar.  I'm baffled!<br><br>You're totally correct about the arbitrary property assessments.  I could keep living here but my disposable income is deteriorating.  I'm living worse now than during my first 5 years of being in the workforce.  My income can only decrease.  I can't work.  I've already taken a couple of serious baths in the stock market. LOL!  I simply highly resent feeling so helpless to all of these skyrocketing prices yet I'm powerless to do anything about it. I did't mind losing relatively large amounts in the stock market because I was healthy enough to replenish it.  I'm OK overall with my portfolio.  It's the being stagnant and disabled that's a PITA.  LOL! <br><br>Those crooks bitch that filling up their luxury vehicles costs more.  Yeah, but other things are far worse.  I don't want to leave me home but I probably will.  I refuse to be one of those "house poor" people. I'd rather scale down and try to preserve having a decent amount of discretionary income…..the honest method…I don't envy those toads but I highly resent the government essentially rewarding the dishonest and relatively lazy ones.  They didn't sacrifice a chunk of their youth getting educated and working harsh 7 day 12-16 hour days for years…I don't want any handout but I certainly don't want my spendable income reduced because the state and feds are gouging me to subsidize them…….yeah, I admit it.  LOL!  What stinks worse is that I NEED the medical care, the surgeries, the meds, etc.  I was with that plan for 12 years…<br><br>Again, thanks Seraphim for acknowledging my silly rants. They act like I should be grateful like a good fairy dropped everything into my lap.  No, I worked hard as hell. I want to pants them when they say stupid crap like I have more than they do. I worked a hell of a lot harder also…no free rides unless you're dishonest or are a career beggar who measures their worth by means other than normal decency! LOL!</div>

<div class="content">I wish I could remember better some of the discussions I had about Georgism ten or more years ago. I think the chief Georgist (if there is such a thing) was one of the people involved but he and his colleagues never succeeded in explaining ow the land tax amount was arrived at in a way I could understand.<br><br>However I think they would have made some points regarding Learning's problems with property tax. First of all a land tax is not the same as a property tax. I don't know how things work in NJ but in England the tax is purely on the property. If I knocked down my house and continued to own the land then I would cease paying any tax on it until I sold it, when I would have to pay capital gains tax.<br><br>The Georgists would say this is a good illustration of how a land tax and a property tax produce exactly the opposite result.  With a property tax I have no incentive to sell or develop an empty lot. I can hang on to it for ever and just watch the value of the land rise, and it might well be the best investment to do just that. But with a land tax, I have every incentive to either develop the land myself or sell it to someone who wants to develop it. The land tax therefore encourages a more efficient use of land (and possibly even a more efficient use of AF too).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>I only wish that was so.  Our property tax is the total of both the assessed value of the land and the property (buildings, improvements, etc)  Unfortunately, in my state, the land value is not constant.  I was shocked to learn that MY land value can increase if my neighbors houses improve in value or something nearby makes the location more desirable!  That's insane but that's how they do it.  A friend of mine's tax skyrocketed out of control when a developer bought some nearby farm land and parsed it into 1/4 acre lots with McMansions on each one.  Not only were they an eyesore, they bumped up everybody's land value.  It's amazing how much people will pay for a silly McMansion!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I really don't know the actual size of the lots. All I know is that these 4,000-6,500 square foot monsters don't have any side windows because they are built so close to each other.  The house itself takes up most of the lot: ultra skinny side and back lots because the house and front lawns are positioned to give the illusion of expansiveness. The landscaping services essentially have only the front lawn to attend to .....or....there's little front lawn so that they can install an inground pool in the backyard, again leaving little actual land. What land is left is usually mulch, ornamental plants and big rocks, a water fall or tiered dividing walls. Living gardens and grass isn't much of a consideration.   LOL!</div>
