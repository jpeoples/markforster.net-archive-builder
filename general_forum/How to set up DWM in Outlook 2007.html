<div class="content">Hi Everyone,<br><br>I'm experimenting with using DWM in Outlook 2007.  Here's a method that might be useful to others who want to use the Tasks function and To Do Bar to track their list items.<br><br>Rather than rely on the calendar for my tasks, my list resides in the Tasks and To Do Bar.  This method works for flagged emails as well.  <br><br>- Create a custom view to include the task name, date modified, due date, and status.<br><br>- Group the list by status.  Outlook uses 4 statues:  Not Started, In Progress, Deferred, and Waiting on Someone Else.<br><br>- All tasks are "highlighted" for dismissal after either a month or a week.<br><br>- Use the Automatic Formatting feature to: Highlight tasks whose Status is Not Started and that were last modified a month or more ago.<br>Create a separate rule to highlight tasks whose Status is In Progress and not modified within a week.<br><br>Using the list:<br>- Work through the Not Started and In Progress lists at the same time.<br>- New tasks added to the list will default to "Not Started" and will be highlighted for dismissal in a month.<br>- To act on a new task for the first time, change its Status to "In Progress" and work on it as you see fit.<br>- All In Progress tasks are highlighted for dismissal if no action is taken on them in a week.<br>- Once tasks are highlighted, review them, reword them, and dismiss them as necessary.  To dismiss, change the status to "Deferred"<br>- Waiting on others:  I use the Waiting Status to track these items.  They are not highlighted for dismissal since they are non-actionable.  I do review these items daily and follow up if needed.<br>- Tasks may have a due date which will also place them on your calendar as usual.<br><br>Hope this helps!<br>Ryan</div>

<div class="content">I'm also using Outlook 2007.<br><br>I'm doing a few things a little differently.<br><br>Instead of highlighting expired tasks, they just drop off the list.  I have another view called "backlog" that shows those items.  I can then delete them or think about them and why they got dismissed.  Or take action and make them "live" again.<br><br>I don't use "status" much.  I use "Not started" and "Completed", of course.  Beyond that I don't use status much.  I do mark things "Deferred" if I don't want to delete them outright.  Then they go onto a someday/maybe kind of list that I expect I'll review one of these days...  But if I never get to it, that's OK.  Realistically I guess I am just deferring them because it's not quite as scary as deleting them.  And maybe if I do review that list a couple times a year, I'll find some stuff I really want to do.<br><br>I use the "Priority" field when it starts taking too long to cycle through the whole DWM list.  I'll run through the whole list quickly, and tag a few as "High".  Then I'll switch to my "High Only" view and work through those things only.  Once I'm comfortable I've made progress on these larger, more complex, more important items, then I'll switch back to "normal" DWM mode, without any priority filter.  This works kind of like Mark's "must do next pass" flag.<br><br>I make extensive use of categories, mainly for managing projects.  If I don't want a project task to show up on DWM, then I remove the due date.  The task then disappears from the main DWM list, but it does show up on my project list.  This way, I can add a new, recurring task "Project X", which prompts me to review that project (filtering on that category).  But I can also leave the tasks with their DWM expiration date and they will also show up on the normal DWM view.<br><br>I also make extensive use of recurring tasks like "Check Outlook In Box".  When I click the "completed" box, the task is re-entered at today+7.<br><br>I also have two buttons with a little macro that sets the due date.  One is for re-entered tasks (sets due date to today+7) and one is for new tasks (today+30).   When I'm reading my emails, if I need to take action I just click the appropriate button then move the email to my email archive folder.  That email then sits on my DWM list till I'm ready to take action.<br><br>This is what I mainly love about doing DWM in Outlook -- it handles everything, including individual emails, project tasks, personal vs work, etc., all in one place.</div>
