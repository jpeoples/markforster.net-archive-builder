<div class="content">When things go wrong as they sometimes will,<br>When the road you’re trudging seems all up hill,<br>When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br>And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,<br>When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>Rest if you must, but don’t you quit.<br><br>Success is failure, turned inside out,<br>The silver tint of the clouds of doubt.<br>And you never can tell how close you are,<br>It may be near when it seems afar;<br>So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit,<br>It’s when things seem worst that you mustn’t quit.<br><br><br>Or, as Leo is saying, things will go funny, accept it. And still, set your direction and go thence. When things don’t all fit your hopes, adjust, accept the journey and then continue herding your lifecats towsrds the goal.</div>
