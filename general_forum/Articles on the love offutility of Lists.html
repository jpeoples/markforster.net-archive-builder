<div class="content">There was a short piece on columnist Alice Jones's love of lists in yesterday's 'i' newspaper:<br><br><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-four-reasons-i-love-lists-even-if-they-make-me-inefficient-a6895771.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-four-reasons-i-love-lists-even-if-they-make-me-inefficient-a6895771.html</a><br><br>...in reaction to a more comprehensive 'Forbes' article on the futility of long to-do lists, which echoes much of what Mark has been saying lately.<br><br><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/02/17/your-to-do-list-where-important-things-go-to-die/#79ebbb009dd2" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/02/17/your-to-do-list-where-important-things-go-to-die/#79ebbb009dd2</a></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Neil. Very interesting article.<br><br>I do however have a problem with the opening paragraph of the Forbes article:<br><br>"Do you really believe Steve Jobs kept a running task list and asked himself several times a day, “What’s my next action?”"<br><br>The reason why people in very high executive positions don't have to do this is because they have people to do the donkey work. If I want to fly to New York for a meeting I have to check my own visa, book my own hotel, order my own airline tickets, print out my own meeting notes, etc. I would imagine that if Steve Jobs wanted to to the same, he would have just told one of his aids to fix it.<br><br>The aid might need the running task list though.</div>

<div class="content">"I do however have a problem with the opening paragraph of the Forbes article:<br>"Do you really believe Steve Jobs kept a running task list and asked himself several times a day, “What’s my next action?”"<br><br>Absolutely. It seems a bit of a disingenuous or even ignorant opening statement. Delegation is patently a key factor in many a magnate's success.</div>

<div class="content">According to this article, Steve Jobs was a notorious micromanager and spent most of his work time reading and writing emails.  <a href="http://allaboutstevejobs.com/persona/steveatwork.php" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://allaboutstevejobs.com/persona/steveatwork.php</a></div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>That's not quite what I get out of the article. He basically hived off all the normal functions of a CEO to other people so that he could directly manage the vision of the company. He could only do that if the donkey work was done by other people.<br><br>The opening remark of the Forbes article makes even less sense now!</div>
