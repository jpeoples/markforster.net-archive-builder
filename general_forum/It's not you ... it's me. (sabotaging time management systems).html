<div class="meta">2011-09-13 18:49</div>
<div class="content">As an infrequent visitor to this forum (although now more regular with the impending advent of the Final Version) and as an even less frequent contributor, I’m hesitant to post a new topic for fear that it’s been covered. So as a starting caveat, feel free to direct me to an earlier post if this topic has already been thrashed out elsewhere.<br><br>I’ve been mulling over my anticipation of another of Mark’s system. On the one hand, my anticipation is steadily building (as if I was a child at the beginning of December looking forward to Christmas); but on the other hand, I have to admit to a dose of scepticism that it might prove to be another system that I start enthusiastically but which soon fizzles out (as if my parents bought me the Christmas present I had longed for, but after several days, it didn’t prove to be as good as I had hoped).<br><br>I’m entirely convinced that the problem is mine – and not a problem of the ‘system’ on offer. I believe that different time management systems (and Mark’s in particular) can go a long way to improving one’s efficiency, and I also believe that different systems probably work better depending on one’s personality and on one’s life/work circumstances. However, all that said, I’m pretty sure that if I had the dedication/drive/motivation/longevity/commitment to stick with any of Mark’s systems in the long term – and not let my commitment slip – then I’m sure I would work far more efficiently than I do. So why don’t I keep doing what I know would work in my favour? (some of you might be citing the apostle Paul here …)<br><br>As a therapist, I continuously come across people who ‘self-sabotage’ – by not doing something that would be good for them, or by doing something that is not good for them. This can be applied at the obvious and conscious level, eg. I don’t keep to a nutritional diet and I don’t exercise, despite knowing it is unquestionably good for me physically, socially, cognitively and emotionally; to the less obvious and (arguably) unconscious level, eg. dragging out the discharge of one of my clients (which actually makes more work in the long run, but I do this because I am fearful they might be disappointed in the therapy, so I keep them on to avoid that sense of failing/disappointing them).<br><br>So, here’s my question:<br><br>Whilst I am holding out hope for further improvements to my efficiency with the advent of the Final Version, am I – like most of the rest of us reading this forum – destined to fail in our attempts to maximise the system because we are likely to sabotage our use of it? <br><br>And if this is the case, then is our eternal quest for the ‘right system’ actually a case of avoiding what we really need to confront: the reason why each of us employs ‘self-sabotaging’ behaviours which stop us from thriving more than we do?</div>

<div class="content">Neumatist: <br>I had similar thoughts today but with different focus. My ideas were that we are not sabotaging ourselves but that we are too expecting from time management systems. These systems should be considered only what they are: systems to help us decide what to do and when to do it. That is all. All the rest is on us - our motivational systems, habits, work attitudes, flexibility, vision...all plays important role.<br><br>Good time management systems should give us certainty that we (1) are in balance (with all the life areas/responsibilities), (2) have overview (thus we will not forget anything), (3) recognize relevant and important tasks over less relevant and (4) can a little bit force ourselves to do unpleasant but important tasks or not to overdo pleasant but not so important tasks (by systems like autofocus, eat the frog, timebox, pomodoro, small steps, schedules etc.) <br><br>That is all. We cannot expect system itself to be "effective". We have to be effective. (Every system "is" effective as such, some people excelled even with the simplest to-do list). We cannot expect system to make the unpleasant tasks for us. We have to. We cannot expect system to find time wasters and useless activities which are not very important but we love to do (e.g. thinking about new time management systems - I am not speaking about Mark, it is his job:). We have to find them. Time management is not cure for living successful and effective life. It is only aid for prioritizing, balancing, and seeing the right tasks. It is our "executive assistant" who tells us every day what should be done as most important. Maybe with little help of "tricks". The rest is on us - if we start the tasks, if we continue with them, if we remain motivated, if we can bear unpleasant, boring, intimidating, anxious situations connected with important projects etc.</div>

A good system should be able to help you to overcome procrastination, keep you going with what you have started, provide a creative tension between the rational and the intuitive mind, make you more aware of what you really want, and so on.<br><br>That's always what I've been aiming for.

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>A recent reading of a study guide on St Thomas Aquinas' works enlightened me about this subject.  The book I am referring to can be found here: <a href="http://www.domcentral.org/farrell/companion/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.domcentral.org/farrell/companion/</a><br><br>Aquinas said fear as a passion happens when an evil arises that we want to run away from.  An evil here means something that can harm or prevent us from attaining or preserving a good (for example money, comfort, pleasure, life).  Now for the evil to aspire fear, then it must have these three characteristics altogether:<br><br>__1) The evil must be either barely surmountable or even impossible to conquer.  We do not fear a rabbit, but we will certainly run away from a large lion roaring at us.<br>__2) The evil must be or could be in the immediate future; the more immediate, the worse the fear.  That's why we do not fear eating a quadruple decker burger when we are healthy, but those who already survived a heart attack do, for they know another one could happen anytime. <br>__3) The evil must afford some form of escape, no matter how slim. And the slimmer the possible escape, the worse the fear. Have you noticed how those with terminal illnesses can be very calm and composed when they come to accept their eventual deaths, that there could be no cure, no escape?  That's because since they know they cannot escape their eventual death, their fear leaves them.<br><br>Note that once one of these are removed, then the whole structure of fear collapses, and we do not fear anymore.<br><br>Now I have come to the conclusion that PROCRASTINATION is a kind of fear.  Why so? <br><br>Isn't it strange that we procrastinate when there is a deadline, and the procrastination gets even worse the nearer we get to the deadline, until we come to a certain point in time when we suddenly go into a flurry of action to beat the deadline? That's pure fear logic for you.  Since the deadline is far off you do not fear the deadline so you do not do anything.  But as it comes nearer and nearer we come to fear the deadline, and we procrastinate even more, especially if lots of possible distractions as means of escape.  And yet we come to the point, so near the deadline, that we realize we cannot escape the responsibility to do something about the deadline, and thus the fear of procrastination disappears, and we work against the clock.<br><br>So what is St Thomas Aquinas' solution to the problem? Well, courage is when you attack one of those three requirements of fear, and the most well known and least realized way is the first one, to challenge the size of the evil. "If God be for us, who can go against us?" (Romans 8:31)  We also get help and resources to plow through evil, so that we can become bigger than the evil.  In procrastination, we find someone to help us, or, even better, for someone to do everything for us. This is also the stratagem of most task management systems like GTD and the AF's: to cut down the problem into smaller pieces and/or do them "little and often".<br><br>Another way is to extend the time: you fear something less when it seems far away.  Therefore, start something early.  However, this is EXACTLY the problem with procrastination; it is kinda like saying to stop procrastinating by not procrastinating.<br><br>The third way, and I think the least worked on and even the weakness of the AFs, is to cut off escape.  And, according to Aquinas, this is the most effective way of them all.  As the author of the guide noted: <br><br>___"No one has yet been able to give an answer to that one question of Christ: 'What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his own soul, or what return shall a man make for his soul?' There is no answer. There is no choice for a brave man. His courage consists precisely in acknowledging that fact and refusing to tell himself there is a choice in spite of the unceasing flow of sophistries suggested by cowardice. "___<br><br>This is the reason why Sun Tzu in his "Art of War" wrote: "Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve."  <br><br>And as noted, this is the weakness of most task management systems, including the AFs, because these present to the person lots of choices as possible tasks to do, then he chooses the best of them all and does them.  Well, the problem is that procrastination FEARS the BEST, and escapes towards the GOOD ENOUGH.  The AF's are ruled by rules; procrastination scoffs at the rules of the time with respect to deadlines, do we honestly think it will honor the rules of AF?<br><br>And there is a worse problem with the AF's. Have you ever noticed that in using the different AFs, at the end of the day it seems you have done the trivial stuffs only and not the important ones? This is because the AFs use the subconscious, which is ruled not by reason but by the passions, and, according to the commentator to Aquinas,<br><br>___"No passion offers any help to the more difficult act of holding on in the face of fear and danger; that is a product of reason alone. To hold to good in spite of danger demands a tranquil soul, a calm willingness to face loss, even to seek loss rather than run; and no passion is a help to tranquillity. It is not by passion that a man weighs his chances and his choices; it is not by passion that his choice falls upon the goodness of his reason, his humanity, his God, a choice that turns an undaunted face to whatever loss, whatever pain, whatever sorrow may be necessary to hold on to the one thing that counts."___<br><br>HOWEVER, we must also note that to totally rely on reason alone to will make any system fall flat on its face, for we are all creatures of passion AND reason.  Aquinas says that the passions intuit the good, therefore the passions are great advisers...but we should let the passions remain as advisers, and let reason have the final decision.<br><br>Therefore, the perfect system to defeat procrastination is one that uses reason, with the help of the passions, to choose what we should do, and it should tell us that what we are about to do is not the best, but the ONE AND ONLY, no alternatives, no escape, no "good enough."<br><br>Hahaha, tough order, eh, Mark? ^__^<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym, excellent essay there! Of 1000 words, I only find a handful to disagree with.  Procrastination is driven by fear, but not usually of the distant deadline. It's fear is the immediate "pain" of the proposed time of working, or the consequential loss of enjoyment doing something else.<br><br>Everything else, right on!</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br>I agree with you - systems can help you to go over procrastination, balance rational and emotional aspects etc. That is what I meant by "tricks". But what I wanted to say was that these are only systems. If we do not obey the rules, do not have clear vision in mind, do not aim our tasks to meaning and importance in our life etc. we cannot blame system for failing to do that. It is like with real "personal assistant" - metaphor I like. We can have better assistant - she can remind us every two hours what to do, what is important, she can "motivate" us, trick us, tell us only relevant things and hide irrelevant. We can have also slightly worse assistant - who forget to tell us sometimes, is moody, who mistakes what is relevant. But still we can be successful and effective. And - what is most important - when we do not want to or do not have our own inner priorities, even the top assistant will not persuade us at all... So in my opinion, sometimes it is better to look into ourselves than to fire next personal assistant :-) (But as anybody on this forum, I am eagerly waiting for your new system/your new personal assistant...)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all for the food for thought …<br><br>And in response, here are several replies /additions:<br><br>In relation to the ‘Physician, heal thyself’: In most cases, the aim is to help a client to eventually situate themselves with increasing ease between two opposing factors – on the one hand, they need to accept the reality of their own limitations, circumstances and potential; and on the other hand, they need to simultaneously develop an increased insight into the historical factors which have determined (and which continue to determine) their perception of their limitations and potential. This insight is then used to bring about realistic change to their limits and potential, which in turn should have a positive impact on their understanding and view of themselves.<br> <br>From my own particular school of thought, self-sabotaging behaviours invariably have their origins in our early life experiences. If, for example, I experienced primary care givers who didn’t provide me with good examples of either looking after themselves or of looking after me (eg. poor diet, erratic sleep patterns, shouting in response to stress … or perhaps more disturbed behaviours such as alcohol misuse etc.) then I am more likely to develop habits which reflect a failure to look after myself and those around me. As I mentioned in my first post, on a conscious and practical level, this will often manifest itself in the same obvious behaviours (ie. repeating the poor diet, etc.), but it will also manifest itself in more subtle and less conscious behaviours, such as repeatedly forgetting to take medication, or – in my own case – persistently delaying the decision to discharge clients because I’m fearful they might perceive the therapy to have been a failure, and one way of avoiding this failure is continuing to delay the point at which the measure of success/failure is possible.<br><br>The ‘healing’ therefore, is the improved insight (and the ability/courage to act upon it). I’ve known for a long time that I wasn’t good at discharging clients, but I previously thought this was merely because I enjoyed the engagement stage more than the ending phase; and I didn’t realise there was something more going on beneath the surface.<br><br>So I wonder what else goes on for each of us beneath the surface which so often leads us to ‘sabotage’ a good time management system. Alan made the point that a system will fail if one ‘neglects the system’. I wonder if our neglect of a system (which we know will be good for us) is actually a by-product of our self-sabotaging acts whereby the underlying driver is a subtle and unwitting self-neglect (as opposed to mere system-neglect)?<br><br>And if that’s true, then I fear that unless the historical (and more recent) causes of the self-neglect/self-sabotaging are confronted, then we will all continue on our quest for the perfect time management system because, we will – at a deeper level – always self-sabotage (regardless of how ingenious the system is, and regardless of its inbuilt design to counteract our self-sabotaging behaviours)?<br><br>All that said, the more a time management system is specifically designed to counteract our self-sabotaging behaviours, the better equipped we become to battle against these same behaviours (even if they remain a thorn in our flesh – to end with the Apostle). <br><br>So – as always – all strength, wisdom and gratitude to Mark.<br><br>Just thinking aloud.</div>

<div class="content">neumatist:<br><br>I think another strong factor in all this is structure. I've remarked over the years that people will tend to behave differently according to what circumstances they are in. So to take an everyday example, people often behave quite differently at home to the way they behave at work. It can sometimes be very disconcerting to a spouse or other family member, who is used to person's behaviour at home, should they see that person at work because they seem to be a completely different person. Another example: regular readers of this Forum will have noticed how often people say that they are perfectly organised at work but totally disorganised at home (or vice versa).<br><br>The key is actually the structure. We all tend to take the path of least resistance, and what that path of least resistance is depends entirely on the structures surrounding us. In an office environment where structures tend to be relatively rigid a person will behave one way. In a home environment where structures are relatively relaxed a person will behave in another way. In the same way, working in an office is very different from working at home.<br><br>What I'm working up to saying is that all time management systems are attempts to provide structure. The better that structure is the better the system will guide the person using it. In other words the system should be making the path of least resistance lead in the right direction. <br><br>The phenomenon of sabotaging the system which you are reporting is really a case of the system failing to provide a path of least resistance which goes in the right direction. In fact what is happening is that because of some failure in the system the path of least resistance is to abandon the system.</div>

<div class="content">I couldn't agree more that 'structure' plays a critical role in our use of time; and I'd equally agree that a good time management system is one which provides a structure which counteracts our tendency to take the path of least resistance.<br><br>Where we might differ (and this might be my misunderstanding of your argument, or merely my own lesser understanding of the wider argument) is that I believe there are two levels which drive our tendency to take the path of least resistance: <br><br>There is a conscious or semi-conscious level which is quickly apparent to us with little reflection (eg. it's easier to let a 10 minute 'internet break' from work quickly become a 45 minute break, rather than get back to the reports that need writing - and this is primarily because we allow ourselves to become distracted by the more interesting task). <br><br>And then there is a more subtle and less conscious level which is not apparent unless considerable reflection is taken (eg. why have we developed the tendency to be more easily distracted than others? what does this say about us and what might we be able to do about this to improve this tendency?).<br><br>Again, I think a good time management system can go a long way to creating a structure which can improve one's efficiency (such as, in this example, minimising the risk of allowing oneself to become easily distracted), but I fear that time management systems are intrinsically limited unless they are set in the context of more fundamental change.<br><br>In search for an analogy, you may want to build a large brick house upon the plot of land where your ageing wooden house once stood; and this would certainly be an improvement.

A good time management system doesn't _counteract_ our tendency to take the path of least resistance. It _provides_ a path of least resistance for us to take.<br><br>I've given the example before of the difference between a swamp and a river. Both consist of water.

<div class="content">neumatist:<br><br>I understand your understanding of two levels of competing with structure. However, from my point of thinking about people, you take too psychoanalyst/historic approach: that type -  we resist or ignore TM rules, because we ignored some parent rules when we were children etc etc. It can be of course true from developmental perspective, at least partly. But it is not so important for that person situation at the moment. What he/she needs to find is HIS/HER OWN way, how to work effectively, how to reach the goals, how to be in balance and how and to what matter put structure on himself etc, irrespective on the fact if he/she was obedient, gifted, spoiled, or ADHD child. <br><br>I fully agree with Mark metaphor about river. Everybody has different "water" inside. Somebody needs to build a dam and regulated water channel (very structured people), somebody needs only free-flowing to the sea (goal) - and they both need different level of structure (banks, regulations of the flow...). E.g. forcing van Gogh or Mozart to use micromanaging GTD would stem probably in anything else than in that amount of work they did... Another example is when somebody lives in so structured environment, that his additional need for inner structure rules is thus pretty low (because everything is already regulated externally), so his TM can be really simple.<br><br>Opposite issue is "house without foundations" as you wrote. That is of course true and you cannot build much on that. But these foundations are in my opinion things which must be built by other methods than by plain time management systems (things like vision, meaning, life orientation, spiritual growth, finding your passions and call, knowledge of yourself etc.)</div>

<div class="content">I think we’ve become somewhat entangled in our metaphors here. <br><br>That said, seeing that a river is fluid and changeable, I can see why it is a more effective metaphor in this context than my earlier 'house/foundations'.<br><br>And apologies for my earlier misunderstanding. Yes, there is an important difference between a system which counteracts the path of least resistance, and a system which actually is that path of least resistance. If anything, this difference is what I find so enticing with the AF/DWM/SF/FV systems and what sets them apart as distinctive.<br><br><< The phenomenon of sabotaging the system which you are reporting is really a case of the system failing to provide a path of least resistance which goes in the right direction. In fact what is happening is that because of some failure in the system the path of least resistance is to abandon the system. >><br><br><< If things are going wrong, don't spend time blaming yourself - strengthen the structure. >><br><br>For the most part, I agree with these two statements; but perhaps we differ on an additional caveat:<br><br>Even when the structure is a good one (ie. provides the path of least resistance), any given individual has the subtle and unconsciously driven potential to choose a path of greater resistance. To keep to the river metaphor, even when the surrounding structures are built so that the river naturally leads to the sea, we occasionally choose to tread water or even swim upstream for a period of time. <br><br>On these occasions, strengthening the structure will inevitably help lead us back towards the sea (and so should therefore be encouraged), but if we are to have a better chance of avoiding another 'treading water' episode further downstream, then perhaps we need to look within ourselves as well as strengthening the structure?<br><br><< If things are going wrong, don't spend time blaming yourself - strengthen the structure. >><br><br>In response, then: Yes, strengthen the structure; but concurrently take the time to explore and revise how you have previously responded to the structure up until this point.</div>

In addition, in most situations and for most goals it would seem this quality cannot be produced, but the next best alternative is to be accountable to another person, which creates the point of no return, and then aim for a task or a system.

<div class="content">Interesting, and I kind of sort of agree.  But I'll contradict the last claim:  Being king of kings doesn't preclude God from being also king of peasants.<br><br>Now as for Procrastinators Anonymous, that's a dubious proposition.  I guess it would have to be "recovering procrastinators" who organize it, but then it will be hard to get people to join.

<div class="content">This is interesting, a magic bullet for procrastination:<br>"I should create an association - didn't matter what it was - but whenever I sat down to work I should do this thing. For example, whenever I sat down to work I might wear a particular shirt. She said when she sat down to write she always put a particular barrette in her hair. Somehow doing this would put you in "the zone" and you'd magically start working.

There was also something on that site about how procrastinators tend to work in long, uninterrupted spurts. ("Time bingeing?")

<div class="content">According to The Procrastination Equation, this is often caused by a tendency to value immediate rewards over distant. Therefore as the distant goal becomes near, the desirability ranking suddenly flips and you find the motivation for the task you were avoiding in its recent urgency. <br><br>There are many approaches to changing this situation. You could set intermediate milestones for example. You could also try to value following the AF principles more highly, expecting consequent benefits.</div>
