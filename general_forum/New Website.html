<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I read your newsletter with interest and really liked todays issue.  I am pleased to say that I do have my priorities right, but its taken me 55 years to get here!  But really I just wanted to say how clean and clear the new website is.  Great colour and format.  I will add it to my favourites.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I like the clarity of the new site and the opportunity to 'join in'.  <br><br>And of the continuing ideas - like 'no option'.  I think its a step on from wanting, needing, must do's etc.<br>  <br>I'm going to try and give myself no option but to work fully during the day, instead of being distractable.  Thanks in part to several of your ideas I actually have a successful business, but could improve productivity with more focus.<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your kind remarks, William, about the site and about my ideas. My only suggestion is that "working fully in the day" is a very large goal to have "no option" about (see <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/28/its-not-an-option.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/28/its-not-an-option.html</a> ). You might do better to start with something smaller - something like having no option about the time you stop working. Then, as I found, once you've experienced the mindset it tends to spread out into the rest of one's life.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, <br>Although I agreed that "working fully in the day" is a poor 'no option', I wondered what a set finish time had got to do with it?    And then I reflected on how I work and yes, the work stretches to fill the time - with plenty of interruptions - and continues into the evenings and weekends.  So, even though I think I spend lots of time with family since I work at home, its not very high "quality time".  So by imposing limits then I'll do more in the time available.<br><br>I've just started reading Do It Tomorrow and recognise the 'Commitment' principle from a previous correspondence we had - I was pondering whether to become a magistrate and you asked whether I was going to do it well [be committed to it].  I thought yes and its worked out well - a stimulating and rewarding alternative to 'work'.  I also like the 'one thing at a time' principle - I'm going to finish off at least one important task per day from now on, before 6pm!<br><br><br>regards<br>will</div>

<div class="content">Generally speaking, I find that it's a good idea to have a definite time for finishing work, no matter what. Or if you prefer, think of it as having a definite time for starting your personal life!</div>
