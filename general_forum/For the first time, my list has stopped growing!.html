<div class="content">I have tried all DIT, AF1 - 4, and it would appear that now with DWM Mark has successfully dealt with the issue of the ever-growing list. I'm a few days into the second month and am keeping note of the total number of tasks in the status bar of my ListPro software.<br><br>This is a good sign and a motivating factor.<br><br>I'm using one file for studio/home/office, with three columns for me to set the context (so many things can be set for more than one context).<br><br>I have a single "bookmark" entry which I drag round and round the list. This is set to all contexts so is always visible. This arrangement seems to work. I'm generally getting round the list at least once a day.<br><br>So well done, Mark, you are step by step dealing with the issues that have cropped up since AF1.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence,<br><br>Good to see this, especially from another ListPro user!<br><br>I only have one context column, with one of the values @Anywhere, the other values generally tend to be exclusive, although there is one caled @Home/UK.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger<br><br>Yes, I think we can deduce we are the only ListPro users here (unaccountably!).<br><br>I forgot to mention I have an additional column to mark entries for planning sessions with my better half.</div>
