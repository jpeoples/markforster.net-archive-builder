<div class="content">DSAF (DEAD SIMPLE AUTOFOCUS)<br>=============================<br><br>I'd like to share a variation of AF which I consider, using it for more than half a year meanwhile, MY "final" version: It avoids long task lists by design, deals with dismissals in a clear and unambigous way – and it's dead simple.<br><br>What I keep from the different incarnations of AF:<br>- the rule that you "dot" a task when you START it,<br>- the rule that you work on a task only as long as you feel like,<br>- the rule that you strike out the task when you stop working on it and, if it's not yet finished, write it again (in other words, if appropriate) at the end of the list.<br>Besides some small errands lists I keep separate, I use only one long list. Unlike as in AF1, pages don't play any role.<br><br>So, what do I do different?<br><br>Dead simple: <br>1. Every sunday evening, I draw a thick line below the last item on the list.<br>2. Then I dismiss (by crossing the pages out) all tasks BEFORE the line I drew LAST sunday.<br>This way, I am left with all tasks that I didn't complete in the past week.<br>3. Then I review the newly dismissed pages and transfer every task I feel I maybe will attack in the coming week to the new list BELOW the newly drawn line.<br>All other tasks get highlighted in yellow for future reviews (as we learned to do in AF1) and become automatically a "maybe one day"-list this way.<br>4. Then I review the highlighted items BEFORE those I just highlighted (older than 2 weeks therefore) for tasks that I want to transfer to my current list as well. <br>(In case of doubt, I transfer a task – the worst thing that can happen is that it will be ignored one more time.)<br>This review I do, you guessed it, as long as I feel like. <br>(I have developed the habit to do this review of older tasks first the next morning – usually Monday –, but <br><br>How I work the active list (which is always rather small – rarely more than 5 pages) depends on my mood. Most of the time I simply scan the pages until a task "stands out". Sometimes I work the list in FV-style: Dot the first item on the list, ask myself, "what  do I want to do BEFORE that?", and so on. Should the list shrink too much (which hasn't happen until now), I'd do another review of the dismissed pages.<br><br>And that's it. Dead simple, as I promised.<br><br>Two additional notes:<br><br>• Apparently, there is no dismissal of pages as in AF1, because this would not make sense. The only dismissal takes place when I „close“ a week. The version DSAF is most kindred to might be AF4, only that the signal to close the open list is the end of a week, not a pass without „standing out“ – which always took too long when I tried AF4, resulting in gigantic lists.<br><br>• Of course you can choose any other cycle or start of week; it does not have to be Sunday evening. I use to shorten or prolong the "weeks" if there is a more significant break. For example, if I am parting on a journey on Tuesday, I’ll draw the line Monday evening and transfer only tasks that will be relevant for the journey. The other tasks will reappear during the review after I am back home (which will result in drawing another divider line).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas,<br><br>Thank you for your post. I respect the fact that you've road tested your ideas over the past six months. Well done!<br><br>I always wanted to use a circa weekly version of an AF system but didn't come up with a workable idea. <br><br>Could you answer 2 small queries? <br><br>< 2. Then I dismiss (by crossing the pages out) all tasks BEFORE the line I drew LAST sunday.<br>This way, I am left with all tasks that I didn't complete in the past week.><br><br>Do you do this in the usual AF way, i.e. put a cross in the top corner of the page?<br><br>< 4. Then I review the highlighted items BEFORE those I just highlighted (older than 2 weeks therefore) for tasks that I want to transfer to my current list as well. ><br><br>Do you ever permanently delete highlighted tasks (by scoring through them) that you know you are never going to do? Or basically do you not feel this is necesarry?<br><br>Thanks again for sharing your ideas.</div>

<div class="content">@Leon<br><br>Q1: I cross out the whole page (upper left to bottom right and upper right to bottom left). I did so from AF1 on because it's more visual this way. For DSAF it's more convenient because I often have to dismiss parts of pages – everything that's above the divider line.<br><br>Q2: No, I never delete highlighted tasks permanently. As you say, it doesn't seem necessary to me. They stay where they are and get forgotten with time … but they are still there should I have the intuition to scan this old notebook from x years ago.<br><br>(I need 2-3 notebooks per year for AF. No other task management system I ever used in my life produced so little overhead. I can still afford to keep them ;-D)</div>

<div class="content">Hello Andreas,<br><br>Thanks for this interesting idea.  I've been using it for my home list for just over 2 weeks and am finding that it functions very well.  For just over a year I've been using the "Pig Pog" Moleskine Pocket Reporter system at home (<a href="http://pigpog.com/2007/01/20/pigpogpda-a-moleskine-hacked-into-a-complete-system/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://pigpog.com/2007/01/20/pigpogpda-a-moleskine-hacked-into-a-complete-system/</a> ) and I find that your idea of a weekly review with dismissal combines very well with that.  It keeps the active list short and relevant.<br><br>At the moment I'm trying out AF1 again at work.  I tried it first when I discovered Mark Forster's systems last spring, but it didn't work for me that time.  However, it think that it was mostly because many of the fundamental concepts were new to me, e.g. "little and often". I've been motivated to try it again because according to this site it seems to have worked for many people over a long period of time.  I recently read your post from a few years back about "Ping Pong AF1".  It seems like a clever way to introduce some more flexibility into AF1 while retaining the structured procrastination effect of the closed lists.  I was wondering why you decided to abandon that system in favour of something else?<br><br>Thanks again,<br><br>Keith<br><br>[I've amended the link to make it work properly. There needs to be a space between the link and any following punctuation marks - MF]</div>

<div class="meta">2013-01-22 22:26</div>
<div class="content">I've come to the conclusion that AF1 is best without any modification. It has its drawbacks certainly, but provided one is sensible about doing things that need to be done now whatever their position on the list it works pretty well. It is also the only system I can work for months on end without getting bored with it. The other two things to remember are to 1) not be reluctant to dismiss tasks according to the rules, and 2) have a recurring task called "Weed List".<br><br>I think AndreasE's "dead simple" system is best described - as he himself suggests - as a variant of AF4 in which the signal to close off lists is the end of the week.</div>

<div class="content">For me too, AF1 has long been my favourite system. I've used it for a very long time and with good results.<br><br>Currently I'm using FV, already for 10 months now, and I feel it's the only system that works even better than AF1 (for me). Even after 10 months, I don't feel any need or inclination to change anything at all.</div>

<div class="content">Just to clarify, when I said above that AF1 is best without any modification I meant that the original instructions work better than any of the suggested modifications to them. I didn't mean that AF1 is the best system (though it may be for some people).</div>

<div class="meta">2013-01-23 20:15</div>
<div class="content">Hello Mark,<br><br>Thanks for the advice and indeed all the ideas exhibited here on the site, not forgetting DIT, which I read recently.<br><br>I wanted to ask 2 more additional questions re AF1:<br><br>1. Optimal no. of lines per page.<br>The original instructions state 25 - 35 lines per page.  My notebook, with 26 lines, is at the lower limit.  I've recently felt some resistance to the system and have problems making a full circuit of the list daily (more below) and was wondering if this could be related.  This theme was discussed before on the fourm and I read a post from you that when you changed from 25 lines per page to 34 you noticed a considerable ease in using the system.  Do you think that it's generally better to have notebook with a number of lines nearer the upper limit, or does it not play such a big role?<br><br>2. Daily starting point.<br>According to the original instructions one should start each day where one stopped the previous day.  However, on the fourm it seems to be generally recommended to start the day on yesterday's page, which is what I've been doing so far.  The advantage is that one can deal with urgent items from yesterday quickly, however a disadvantage I see is that if one doesn't make a full circuit each day the pages just before yesterday are neglected.  I sometimes don't make it round the list due to getting stuck on the last pages or due to lack of time because of meetings.  I guess that the original method of picking up where one left off yesterday would deal more fairly with the entire list because if a full circuit is not possible one day then at least it will be completed the following morning.  However of course this method does not deal as well with urgent items.  Do you endorse a particular method or do you think it's simply a matter of personal taste and circumstances?<br><br>I'd also be grateful for the opinion of any other long-term users of AF1 out there!<br><br>Thanks,<br>Keith</div>

<div class="content">Keith<br><br>I describe somewhere that in my last foray into AF1 I was using a notebook with 46 lines to the page and it worked very well. So I suggest you experiment with page lengths to see what suits you best. You can double the number of lines on a page either by using two columns or treating two facing pages as one page. <br><br>As for the daily starting point, the original instructions don't specify where you should start each day, so it's your choice whether you start where you left off, start at the beginning of the list, or start at the beginning of the previous day. On the whole I think I prefer starting where I left off, but I'm certainly not going to be dogmatic about it.</div>

<div class="content">@Keith:<br><br>You asked why I abandoned "Ping-Pong-AF", which served me well for years.<br><br>The reason is that I was nevertheless always struggling with the active part of the list (between the last page where I started and the first active page where I "ping-ponged" to) becoming bigger and bigger. I once became aware of what a relief it was to start a new notebook and only take the tasks with me that I considered as "still relevant" among all that were on the lists. This feeling made me ponder, and after a while – my active list was again too big to handle – I decided to merciless  dismiss everything except the last three pages and transfer the relevant tasks immediately. Worked great. So I played with this a bit, and one of the ideas I came up with was to just repeat this process every weekend. And that was it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi AndreasE,<br>Great post. I'm wondering if you could clarify one point.<br><br>So you draw a line Sunday night and then you go to the previous line you drew the week before and cross out all of the pages from that week, namely, the week before. Now that leaves you with a week of stuff where the pages have not be x-ed out just above the newly created line. So, is it the crossed out pages or the ones in the week you just finished that you go through and either highlight or transfer? Could you clarify. Because it would seem that if it was the week you just finished then you might as well cross those pages out too. Could you clarify. Thanx so much.</div>

<div class="meta">2013-01-29 9:13</div>
<div class="content">@Steve:<br><br>I do the highlighting or transfer only from the crossed out sections. As you saw yourself, it would make no sense otherwise.<br><br>To clarify, I try to picture the list:<br><br>LIST ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON, January 27th, 2013:<br><br>(tasks of week 7th-13th january: crossed out, highlighted)<br>____________________ <br><br>tasks of week 14th-20th january: active, closed<br>____________________<br><br>tasks of week 21st-27th january: active, open<br><br><br>On Sunday evening, I draw the line below the last week and crossed out the week before. <br>So, the next day it looks like this:<br><br>LIST ON MONDAY MORNING, January 28th, 2013:<br><br>(tasks of week 7th-13th january: crossed out, highlighted)<br>____________________ <br><br>(tasks of week 14th-20th january: crossed out, highlighted)<br>____________________<br><br>tasks of week 21st-27th january: active, closed<br>____________________<br><br>tasks of current week: open, active<br><br><br>And so on ...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br>I've been using DSAF since the beginning of Jan. at home and since the beginning of Feb. at work (apart from a brief trail of SMEMA).  For me personally it's the most successful system presented on this site, which I've tried.  Some advantages I've noticed:<br>- The weekly dismissal/review keeps the list very short and relevant.  For example, at the end of my month long trail of AF1 in Jan at work I had 44 open items on my list.  After the first dismissal with DSAF I had 15 active items!  That's since fluctuated according to workload, but has never been above 30 items spread over 2 - 3 pages.<br>- I like that the rules do not define exactly how one should process the active list.  With several of the systems here I found that I resisted the very clearly defined rules e.g. with FV having to follow a chain of pre-defined tasks in a certain order.  With DSAF the choice is left to the user.  Motivation comes instead from the simple, time-based dismissal and the closed list of last week's entries.  I usually use the "stand-out" principle or ask myself "what do I have to do next"?<br>- One list for (almost) everything.  I put almost everything into the list including for example "waiting fors" preceded by "WF" so they stand-out.  Dismissed items automatically become a Someday/Maybe list to be reviewed weekly.  This review can be as simple as AndreasE describes or could be expanded into a GTD-style review if required.<br>What's your experience of DSAF been?</div>

<div class="meta">2013-03-13 19:22</div>
<div class="content">Hi Keith, <br><br>I personally think DSAF is a really good system in the style of AF. Unfortunately I have a major problem relating to anxiety and being able to remain with any one system - so I have not been able to build up months of experience with it as Andreas has done. (Loud scream). However, I'm sure I will return to DSAF in a few days / weeks! Best of luck and keep us informed of your progress if possible!</div>

<div class="content">I hadn't really thought about this system before, but it's looking tempting.<br><br>If I read this right, you draw the line then add those things from two weeks ago that you dismissed -- before you look at the older pages. I like that. You know how much is on your plate for the week before you give those older tasks an opportunity to crash the party. I'm going to try something similar.<br><br>By copying those 2-week old tasks to the active week, you're also evaluating them more often, in the context of the coming week rather than individually.</div>

<div class="content">Hi AnderasE<br>Although most people remember you for creating PingPong method, I learned much when you explained how to integrate your appointments, deadlines and incremental milestones when writing your novels.  Until you wrote that post, I worked my calendar separately from my list.  Thank you for that great advice.  It's so helpful to know that all of my non-negotiable obligations are on the first day of the week of my week's list.  I also borrowed your idea of adding new work to the list as it comes.  That turns it into a rolling list.  I also borrowed from your X47 to keep a separate section for notes.  My list would get unwieldy when my notes were jumbled with my jobs and tasks.  If I didn't have brain damage, I'd probably use DSAF as written.  It never occurred to me to make my calendar items the first part of the list.  That's quite ingenious!<br><br>Thanks for sharing your great ideas!  <br><br>Are any of your novels translated into English?  Because I haven't needed to speak German for decades, I'm sure that I'd have difficulty reading it.  LOL!</div>

This forum truly attracts many interesting, intelligent and very kind people.  Mark set the tone years ago and it's stayed the same.

And living in the USA is relatively disapointing when it's oktoberfest, Easter and Christmas.  *sigh*  I was there in the 1950's.  Other than the local German kids beating us up to steal our clothes and money, it was a very magical place for a child.  It was truly beautiful!  The flowers, the fountains, statues, galleries and museums and the Berlin zoo!  (This is a child's view.  I'm sure it's much better than what I was exposed to.)  I also loved it when my parents took us on vacation to kitzbuhel, austria.  Oh my God, it was breathtakingly beautiful.  There was no shortage of snow to play in!

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br>Thank you for your well wishes.  Today the doc told me not to expect much help.  There's only so much that they can do but if I don't get the surgery it's 100% sure things will get worse faster.  *sigh*  <br><br>My friend is a true science fiction fan.  He is sending me his copy.  He said that you are a world renown author! ! ! WOW!  I'm impressed.  I told him not to tell me anything about the book.  I want to be surprised.  The only science fiction I've ever read are books he told me that I MUST read.  He has always been correct.  He said "The Carpetmakers" is uniquely presented and will cause me to think and stay in suspense.  I'm really looking forward to it.<br><br>Again, thanks AndreasE for taking the time to share your AF tweak and especially the projects and calendar integration!  (I still must look at my  2 calendars and several notes strategically placed to get me out the door!  One calendar is in the bathroom because I know for a fact that I'll be in that room!  LOL!)</div>

<div class="content">Hi AndreasE<br>I am giving a try to your system DSAF and I need your help because something is not very clear for me. I already put my task day by day so it is simple to close the list. <br>We are wednesday so I close my list. I have jump to last wednesday week (2 to 6 of september) and reported all I hope to do next week. I did the same the week before (ie 26 to 30 of august) and I also reported the tasks I plan to do (only 3) <br>But what about this past week ie 9 to 13 th of september. Would'nt be clever to report what I plan to do which is not already done and dismiss all the rest ? <br>The result is now a list of 40 items I plan to do next week.<br>Thanks for helping ;-)</div>

<div class="content">@jupiter<br><br>This is how I did it at first: Draw a line and immediately review the dismissed tasks. But when the actual workweek comes towards its end, you'll have the problem that all the tasks you've "touched" (=you worked a bit on them and reenter them at the end of the list) accumulate at the end of the list, THEN you draw the line below and then you have to pull them ALL over once again.<br><br>Too much administrative work, plus: it creates a resistance towards stopping tasks when you feel like stopping. So, I reconsidered my approach -- and I came to the conclusion that the best way is just to keep the list of last week (as a closed list) and the list of the new week (as an open list, because you'll add new and re-entered tasks).<br><br>So, let's say, we have week 38, then the tasks of week 38 and 37 are still active, everything else (until week 36) is dismissed and highlighted and serves as a "maybe one day list" I review from time to time to see which tasks I feel like I want to re-active them (in which case I pull them over on the open end of my current list). That's all. When "Working the list", I scan the tasks of week 37 and 38 and do what feels like doing, or, when I feel like doing another approach, I deal with this list FV-wise (dotting the first task and then looking for what I want to do BEFORE that one etc.).<br><br>I have to mention that I don't divide my list day-wise (because: why should I?); I have only one continuous list of tasks; divided by a line every week. And that's it. <br><br>I hope that helps.</div>

<div class="content">Hi AndreasE<br>Thank you very much. It is clear in my mind. I find your system interesting because it is close to AF4 which created open and close list day per day. Even AF4 was really great it has the inconvenient to make grothing lists (like AF1) which became soon un manageable. Your system seems to get rid with unactionnable tasks and grothing list and that's fine. <br><br>After reading Mac cormack book (getting results for dummies) I have found many ideas which are fully compatible with your way of doing things.<br><br>What I wonder is about notes. I have a lot of them. New clients, new buildings, ideas, thought about things, new ideas about business developpement and so on.<br><br>For many reason I have stopped to use computer for tasks and notes for a spiral A4 notebook. The basic way in French real estate ;-)<br><br>I wonder how I could treat thats "notes". I like the idea of continuous tasks. Would it be more simple to keep the left page per day for notes and the right on for tasks or would it be more easy to divide my new note book in 2 front book for tasks and midle to the end for notes. <br><br>What do you think about it. <br><br>NB Congratulation for the clock per day of your note book it makes easier the following of time and planification. I kept the idea ;-)</div>

<div class="content">@Jupiter:<br><br>I keep notes and task lists totally separated, because I make A LOT of notes; they would simply overwhelm task lists.<br><br>I use a spiral notebook, too (for the same reasons I use paper and pen for task management), but A5 format, and with microperforated pages I can easily tear out. What I do is: I start a new page for every subject. I ALWAYS (since 30 years or so) write the actual date in the upper left corner and a keyword for the subject in the upper right corner. Then the notes, whatever. <br><br>So, in the notebook I have a kind of a "timeline" of my notes, subjects totally mixed.  (If I scan backwards from today I have: notes for my novel, ideas for a birthday gift, notes for a review I intend to write, notes concerning a computer problem my wife has (I am the one who is supposed to solve it), a recipe I stumbled upon, an idea for a new novel, a page of my diary, some philosophical thoughts, a concept for an important letter, and so on.) <br><br>But later, I tear out all pages I intend to keep and put them in binders, alphabetically ordered, so that all notes to a certain subject come together, sometimes divided by YEARS! (It's amazing what you get if you do this for years. Basically, I have a true picture of my life in these binders.)<br><br>So, notes are a part of my information management system. But my notebook and my task list are always together, and if I travel, both come with me ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi AndreasE<br>I'm still waiting for the book to arrive *sigh* (I feel like a child waiting for Christmas Eve...)  Your binder system of notes sounds quite intriguing!  If you ever get the inspiration to write your memoir, those notebooks will come in handy.  I am more interested in how an author thinks: what information interests him, how he manipulates it to help form his thoughts and how it is organized to serve his thoughts.  I'd suspect that gathering information is a part of creating original thought and to help clarify the thinking that's important to you.  I'm sure your readers would be thrilled to get a glimpse into your thinking system.  My friend told me that The Carpetmakers will cause me to think and tickle the philosopher in me.  I look forward to it!<br><br>Because you're being so generous and willing to answer questions, I must take this opportunity while you lend your ear.....<br><br>1.  You said you are using a spiral notebook.  Is that only for notes or is it a separate section/book for cataloging your thoughts exclusively?  I use a ring binder system for my tasks and jobs and quick fleeting notes to jog my memory or lead my work.  I keep my more permanent thoughts in my computer....such as they are.  LOL!  Are you still using X47 for guiding your work and other duties?<br><br>2.  Do you intermingle your goals timeline with your task list or have a separate page to gauge your progress.  My brain can't easily cull information that's scattered so I have separate pages for things I want to track. How do you keep track of longer goals with connected tasks?<br><br>3.  Do you blend the mundane tasks with your more important work?  I use to have my chores and recurring responsibilities habituated.  Now I need physical reminders to let me know when I've completed or neglected something.  If you do in fact insert your recurring responsibilities into your system, doesn't that cause your DSAF list to get too long?  I find that it's easier to write categories as the task for example clean, laundry, check investments, pay bills, etc.  Then I go to my separate page/section to guide my decisions.  I'd guess that we do at at least a dozen recurring maintenance jobs per day that each consist of several more individual tasks!  LOL!  Even before my brain damage, needed a guide to make sure everything is current or ahead.  How do you do it?  Since you're a creative person, it must be difficult to stay current when your mind takes you into the creative zone. LOL!  I was horrible with that!  My family and friends would resent me closing myself off from the world when I'd be on a creative bent or immersed in a learning process.  Does that also happen to you?  I'd have to actually set an alarm to wake me out of my trance.  LOL!<br><br>Thank you for your generous spirit in answering our questions.  I use a weekly version of DIT laced with several ideas I lifted from you!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">@Learning as I go:<br><br>>1. You said you are using a spiral notebook. Is that only for notes or is it a separate section/book for cataloging your thoughts exclusively?<<br><br>No, I use 1 notebook for everything. Errands list, philosophical meditation, novel scene development, notes for a letter ... all goes in there. But on different pages, of course.<br><br>>Are you still using X47 for guiding your work and other duties?<<br><br>Yes. I hope to do so for the rest of my life, because a better calendar system is simply not conceivable.<br><br>>2.

I usually have a week goal for the novel in progress, for example (this friday, I hope to reach the 92.100 words mark, for example).<br><br>>How do you keep track of longer goals with connected tasks?<<br><br>For more complicated projects with connected tasks, I usually have a page in my notebook where I scribble down everything that's important.<br><br>>3.

Which realms it belongs to is unimportant.<br><br>>If you do in fact insert your recurring responsibilities into your system, doesn't that cause your DSAF list to get too long?<<br><br>Well, I don't include things that I do habitually (brushing teeth, for example), that's what habits are for, aren't they? That you don't forget them. And I don't put recurring responsibilities on my task list if they're dated (for example, paying fees): such things go into my computers calendar system as dates with reminders, so that they make "BLING!!" at the right time ;-)<br><br>>Since you're a creative person, it must be difficult to stay current when your mind takes you into the creative zone.<<br><br>Yes, this is in fact still an issue. When I'm writing, I tend to forget the world around me. In difficult phases, I use alarm clocks. I have two of them at hand on my desk.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br>Thank you for your answers.<br><br>re:X47 calendar.  I love that the schedule is on top and I can place my Weekly MITs below it.  I think better with an overview.  Because of my cognitive deficits, I write a daily MIT list to provide cueing and focus.  Once they're done, I can choose freely what to do with the rest of my time.  I hate getting into a project or simply relaxing unless my MIT list is done for the day.  If I'm having a tough time and I can't remember much, I post a note to let me know that I'm free for the day.  Each time I pass it, I smile.  LOL!<br><br>re: Projects in calendar.  I probably lifted this from you.  I see my deadlines on the calendar which helps me to formulate my Weekly MITs.  I like devoting a page to the project so that seeing my progress gives me an extra boost of confidence.  Also, sometimes I like to write a fleeting note or two that gives my mind a direction to think of ideas and tasks to further it along.  When I totally fail, I rip it up and start a new page.  LOL!<br><br>re: A task is a task is a task.  I wish I could think that way.  Sometimes it's difficult for me to differentiate what's a task and what I simple want to work on for myself.  Also, I try to keep mundane tasks down to a minimum.  I could easily spend hours and hours over-cleaning, over managing my filing system, take on too many projects, etc.  It's not simply memory deficits.  My brain has always been kaleidoscopic.  It's a blessing for creativity and problem solving.  It's a curse for list creation.<br><br>re:habits (brushing teeth, for example)  LOL!  I have checklists for that because my memory fails me over and over.  I go to brush my teeth and it's already wet.  I go to cook breakfast and the dishes are wet in the drying rack.  When it pertains to drugs, it could be quite dangerous if I didn't keep a separate list.  I keep eating lists to remember to eat.  If I go too long not eating, I lose too much weight.  It's easier for me to keep wipe off lists separately.  Yes, my brain is practically useless.  LOL!<br><br>For recurring batches, I use fake deadlines to prevent forgetting or to prevent spending too long on it.  Example: Too much cleaning is not necessary yet it's impossible to do too much laundry.  LOL!  I put the category as a task on my weekly list.  I have to have it completed by the fake deadline.  It keeps me up to date.  <br><br>I stole your idea of adding one offs to the running list.  I'll do them when it's time.  I don't clear my batches every day.  I just review them to make sure no bombs are ticking.  LOL!<br><br>re: Alarms.  THANK YOU for revealing that.  At least I don't feel so bad having to do that also.  I also have a two alarm clock .......just in case.  LOL!  I also use the double alarm to get me out the door.  If I forget why it's buzzing, I check either a calendar or notice one of two or three extra notes to remind me where I'm going.  LOL!<br><br>Speaking of where I'm suppose to go....I called and moved back my surgery.  I admitted that I am too much of a chicken face right now to face it.  They gave me two more weeks to get sensible and brave.  *blush*<br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to answer these questions.  It seems as though you haven't changed anything except drawing the line on Friday.  I've always considered Friday the end of the week unless I intentionally want to work on the weekend.  That's rarely my wish.  LOL!<br><br>My book should arrive soon.  I'm excited to read it.  Hopefully, that will help distract my mind from the dreaded scalpel.  I can't stay being a chicken face for too much longer.LOL!</div>

<div class="content">I do laundry most weekdays. Put in a load, fold and deliver a basket or two, and call it done. Every so often during the day I move the load along and put in another load if needed, but the folding and delivery waits until the next day. (A few things get hung immediately, but we don't own much that needs it.) Some days there's not enough for a load, other days it's five loads. I can miss a few days in a row and get caught up quickly enough. We have an extra week's worth of spare sheets and towels. I'd have to spend the money anyways, when they wear out, and this way I don't have to rush laundry. I can also change all the sheets one day, and wash them several days later.</div>

<div class="content">Hi AndreasE<br>Your answers are very helpful. Thank you.  Your answers are also very kind.  I especially thank you for that.<br><br>Almost all my life I got teased or criticized because I'm too methodical and excessively conscious of order and cleanliness.  I was taught that everything must be almost perfectly clean and ordered once a week so that training never left my mind.  My feelings get hurt when people say my house makes them feel uncomfortable.  I think they are exaggerating, though.  I have a huge furry German Shepherd who's always shedding and dribbling her slobber onto the floors.  That's proof that my house isn't too clean for relaxation.  Thank you for saying that the deadlines in my head are sometimes even more important than other deadlines.  I suppose all of us have ideas in our head of how to maintain our lifestyle.  I'm especially grateful that you called the deadline REAL.  Again, thank you for you kind opinions.<br><br>Oh, my God!  I almost got frightened when I visualized an entire week of forgotten email hitting the inbox at once!  I have unattended to emails FAR LONGER than a week old!  LOL!  In fact, I have to force a fake deadline to even check my email ONCE a week.  That doesn't necessarily mean addressing each of them.  I only care about deadlines and money matters for email.  LOL!   You are far more disciplined than I am about email.  If it's not critical, it's HIGHLY likely that I'll ignore it.  LOL!<br><br>Did you say that your calendar, addresses and notes are A6 and your spiral notes are A5?  Do you have two X47 books?  If so, you well deserve the extravagance!  LOL!

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>5 loads of laundry in a day?  YIKES!  You're a far better person than me.  Just reading about it made me skip a breath.  LOL!  Because I live alone, I only have 3 loads a week unless I'm changing out clothes and linens for a new season.  Even then, I'd only do one load a day starting it early.  I pull out the clothes and linens before they are totally dry and hang them. That way there's less wrinkles and less wear and tear on the stuff washed.  My motives are pure laziness.  It's easier to keep clothes and linens in good condition than having to force myself to shop for more.  I don't know why I hate shopping so much.  I hate getting out the door to grocery shop but once I'm there, I'm usually OK.  Cooking and eating are the only benefits of errands shopping.  LOL!  Are your children too young to help you?  5 loads in one day?  Geez! I'm still shaking my head in admiration for you to be willing to do such a chore!  I hope your family appreciates you!</div>

My son's desk is in the basement, so if I'm doing it on a weekend he does most of it.<br><br>I don't bother folding clothes for the kids, since they don't care.

<div class="content">Learning, don't keep putting it off! The anticipation is the worst part. I'm in that stage now, because my surgeon thought being emotional (I'm an emotional person) and wanting information about alternatives to routine but major and controversial (because it used to be done too often) surgery means I don't want the surgery she originally offered. After a few hours on the internet, I know more about them than she seems to! Next week we see a specialist in the teaching hospital to confirm that the internet was correct about a few details (which cause me to not want that alternative), then I'm forcing another visit with the local surgeon and taking my husband with me. I just want a date so I can plan, and get the thing over with, but I keep anticipating another delay from the surgeon, who, in all fairness, thinks she's doing what I want.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>My heart goes out to you.....especially since I'm in the same position as you!  My surgery, unfortunately is not routine.  My biggest worry is the bone grafting.  Last time they took a chunk out of my hip.  My hip is now ugly but why's going to see it?  LOL!  My greater worry is that they want to use harvested bone.  I'd rather use my own bone but .....oh, well.  Talk about emotional, I'll probably have silly dreams about that "strange bone" growing in my body like it's an implanted alien who's going to take over my existence like......a pod person.  LOL!   I'm joking but the seed of the worry is there.  What if my body doesn't welcome it?  They seem very relaxed that everything is going to be OK.....What if they make a mistake and my pain and nerves are worse.  I keep playing the gratitude game that they aren't doing brain surgery to fix my brain.  LOL!  I'd rather stay stupid than taking a chance with that.  LOL!<br><br>I truly hope that your mind comes to a more peaceful state  and that you have a SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME!  Please don't be supermom.  Let the family do for you until the doc says it's OK to resume your life's activities.  Recovery is critical!   After my first surgery, I got antsy and bored.  I'm naturally curious and boredom prone so I played a trick on myself.  When I wanted to dust, sweep or vacuum, I said, NO!  I'm on a vacation!  LOL!  Before the surgery, I cleaned like a crazed demon and got the business stuff as ahead as I could.  I bought crosswords, a pretty journal so I could occupy myself without the pain of actually sitting too long.  And I made sure that every day I ate like a queen....like I was on vacation.  LOL!<br><br>Best of luck, Cricket.  I'm sending good wishes you way for a successful surgery and a speedy and not too painful recovery.<br><br>LOL about your kids dressing out of the laundry basket in the basement.  The visual is funny!  You're a liberal mom.  We weren't allowed to leave our clothes out.  It might be a fun game to see what you could pull out of a laundry basket without seeing your selection like a closet showing everything.  I even hang my tee shirts so I can see what my options are!  LOL!  The only clothes I don't hang are under things and pj's.  LOL!  I also keep a chart because I can't even remember what I'm currently wearing unless I take the time to look!

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>I almost forgot, my largest worry stems from the specialist insisting on my other doctor sign a form saying that it's OK to operate on me considering the metal already in my body.  Somehow the metal makes the risk of infection higher which puts me at greater risk.  I looked online and people have died from it....rare....but it's now in my brain. LOL!

She is also fine.<br><br>Don't worry about me not taking time for myself. I'm good at that, when it comes to pain and physical healing. Emotional, not so good, and a day after the anesthetic I probably shouldn't have been marking music theory (but the kids didn't notice).<br><br>Instead of expensive notebooks to pressure yourself to be neat, how about inexpensive ones that it's okay to be messy in, and then a second, neater copy if appropriate, and even a third. Less stress up front might help, and using different parts of your brain for each stage (creation, editing, clean copy) might help. It's worth experimenting. On the other hand, if your digital system "ain't broke", then "don't fix it."<br><br>Your surgeon's lawyer probably had him do that form. My old doctor lost a patient because the info (lawyer-approved) that came with the routine antibiotic scared her into not taking it.

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Thanks for the reassurances.  You probably marked the papers because your brain was hungry for stimulation. LOL!  Better to mark papers than decide to start a project that required you to fire up the power saw!  LOL!<br><br>re: writing.  I've run the gamut about writing.  I'm finally realizing that applied effort doesn't influence actual brain damage and spinal cord damage.  I discovered that rewriting doesn't help because I'm using the same brain and hand that created the original copy.  LOL!  Eh, it's annoying but I'm fairly resigned to this fact.  I had to resign myself to a lot of deficits.  Nobody wants to be disabled physically or cognitively. I'm better with it now overall but I get enraged all the time.  LOL!  At least I'm past the crying stage about living in this faulty carcass.  I think the frustration and futility short circuits my patience.  I'd rather yell than cry.  LOL!<br><br>I still don't understand it how the metal is more prone to create infection.  Oh, well.  My regular doctor signed it.  I guess that's sort of encouraging.....but....bone grafting and infection aren't a good cocktail!  LOL!  I suppose they don't want to use my bone again because that would make two sites of surgery.  <br><br>You had to sign a form agreeing to "doctor-in-training might practise on you".....ARE YOU SERIOUS?  You're a braver person than me!  Certainly not neurosurgery!  Having a top notch doc greatly increases the chance for a successful surgery.  If they handed me a form like that, I'd spit between their eyes!  LOL!  I even have a special reserve fund in case I need the cash.  Mostly, I'm saving it for the hope that in the future stem cell research will let them fix my spinal cord and peripheral nerve damage.  If it doesn't happen, my estate will be worth that much more.  LOL!<br><br>Years ago, Dad was in awful shape.  The EXCELLENT policy wouldn't cover his surgery until after he stayed alive after a year.  The cardiac surgeon wouldn't touch him without advance payment.  How many people have an extra $50K to hand a surgeon.  If he relied on the insurance, he'd be dead now.  That was in the 1980's.  Even though the odds given to him were 90% instant death, 5% coma  or paralysis and 5% success.....he got the 5% success.  He lived an extra ten years because of it.  I have lots more than that tucked away to take care of inflation or needing the surgery overseas.  The USA is SLOW to approve procedures and insurance is even slower!  LOL!  That money is separated from all my other money and investments.  Either I eventually get an operation and I get a new chance on life, or I stay a stupid gimp and my family gets it.  LOL!  Either way, I'm hedging my bets on medical science advancing quickly enough for me.  I'm in the last season of my life span.  They'd better hurry up!  LOL!<br><br>It's lovely that the staff was so kind and thoughtful with your daughter.  I hope she's OK now.  I had a brother who lost over a year out of his life and practically lived a Children's hospital.  God bless the dedicated staff.  My heart was in agony over my brother's suffering and they have to see that in multiples every day of work.  I had trouble seeing the research experimental animals.  It caused my AGONY to see it.  I'd totally go mental if I had to see kids suffering as part of my job description.  God bless that their kindness is wrapped in courage.  Helplessly witnessing suffering makes me shamefully weak especially the kids that are terminal.  <br><br>Good luck with your surgery.  If possible, don't allow them to practice on you.  Do your research and insist on a specialist with an excellent reputation.  You only have one body and one lifespan.  Let them choose somebody else.  LOL!  I wouldn't even allow a green dentist to touch my mouth let alone a surgeon to cut me up!  Insist on the best for yourself!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Reading back my post about Dad is very garbled.  My recollection put my orientation like I'm in the 1980's right now.  LOL.  Of course, Dad's dead but what I meant was that he took a huge gamble and got an extra 10 years added to his lifespan.  Those bean counters employed by the insurance companies are heartless.  Dad was lucky enough to be in a position to help himself.  I had to hire a lawyer to force the insurance to pay my bills.....plus damages!  LOL!  That's what they get for being money-grubbing, heartless **cktards!  How many people are unnecessarily suffering or even dead because of naive trust in insurance policies or doctors accepting their plan?  I'd probably be a quadriplegic if I relied on them deciding my fate.  PLEASE don't take it on faith that they have your best interests in mind.  Ultimately, they're bean counters.  INSIST on good medical care.  You're not a cadaver in medical school.  You're a live human being who has people who love you and respect you.  Let them practice on people who don't give a damn about themselves.  You're too valuable to many people.  Let them use an old, disabled single person who doesn't currently contribute to anybody's quality of life, who's also a bit more naive than I am!  LOL!  I'm absolutely FLUMMOXED that they dared to ask you to sign that piece of paper.  At the very least, you are a mother to young children.  They are deplorable to even suggest it to you.  My dog will benefit from my ire over this because it will take me longer to walk it off.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Learning, I think we're both emotional on this. Best to walk away from it. I'm happy with the choice I've made. It's not neurosurgery. It's the 2nd most common surgery women in this country  have (2nd only to C-sections). Two surgeons, two sets of hands and eyes, taking the time to point out all the things they usually barely look at. It's routine for even our small hospital, even if it's not routine for me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Sorry...I didn't know that you were talking about a typical OB/GYN procedure.  Since you were discussing transplants and bone grafting, I assumed that it was either cardiology or neurosurgery or obstetrics or another specialty that involves a high level of knowledge and skill beyond the "regular" or more "routine" surgeries.  Almost my entire family is in the medical field.  I even vetted the anesthesiologist.  A large percentage of surgery "errors" are related to the anesthesiologist.  I still respect that you are having a routine procedure.  I'd make damn sure that the anesthesiologist is NOT in training.  LOL!

It's a routine (to doctors) procedure for women my age. I miss the days when we trusted the doctors to know what was best. I wouldn't trust a doctor who didn't explain things and give me options (and say why he doesn't recommend certain options based on my specific details and his own experience), but all this internet research into alternatives and complications, and not being able to fully-understand any of them, is stressful.

<div class="content">I totally agree with Alain when he says "I concluded that keeping the AF list short". AF is a great system mainly for me because it uses the collecting and processing part of GTD combined with simplicity. But when it becomes huge with many many pages it become then furiously un manageable. What Leon introduced is a kind of automatically dismissal. I use my list for collecting stuff, treating and following tasks, historical of what I did and following my aims and results to get (GTD short term perspectives). I do it on a spiral note book on the left page by column (Check-Contexts-People-projets and next action) and use the write page for notes and ideas. I also have folders for GTD references. I also use a pocket note book for collecting stuff which will go in my spiral note book later. My systems works pretty well. It is fast and easy. I noticed that what I did not do 2/3 weeks ago  was not worth to do it. I don't take time to cross or think about. These items are no longer actionable they died.<br>This system let me time for thinking about my projects when I do my daily or weekly review. I can think about each and plan when to do them on my diary with no stress. <br>During the day I noticed that what ever happen, phone calls, people rushing in my office (even I crossed the door !) crises of any kind all that stuff can be collected in my spiral note book and treated asap. At night I can see at a glance what I did. <br>Anyway I was blocked in my system because I did not use the Leon dismissal. I was treating my list as an open list. It never ended so I felt at a time discouraged. <br>When I started the habit of putting today's date and on wednesday evening started to double  cross my page and put the next week ie Week 43- Monday 21th to Saturday 27 th <br>then write all my project and what I intend to do about each of them the next week I suddenly got the control of my activities. Not only I could free my mind collecting everything which happened in my my but I could also plan the future and follow the past controling what I have done. Leon's DSAF put the last stone of my system. He gots me rid of of the items I did not really know what to do with. <br>SO with AF and DSAF and GTD, James westman system (the spiral note book see here <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html)</a>  and my own trick  I have found "my system" it is simple, it is on paper, I can trust it, and I d'ont loose time. <br>I wanted to share it with you this was the less I could do. :-)</div>

<div class="content">I've read the ongoing discussion about DSAF with great interest but haven't actually tried it myself. I've been reluctant to do so because my own experience with AF1 in particular is that it takes less than two weeks for my list to reach a more or less steady size, and it's only a very few tasks which have not either been actioned or dismissed by the time two weeks is up.<br><br>For example, looking at my list from the last time I used AF1 I see that I had 91 tasks on my list on August 9th, but by August 12th there were only 13 of those tasks left unactioned (none dismissed).<br><br>So it doesn't seem to me that DSAF would have any advantage for me. But it does raise the question of why other people have a different experience. Why do those who find DSAF useful have a large number of tasks still outstanding at the two week point when I don't?<br><br>I don't know enough about other people's experience to be able to answer this. I certainly don't think it's because I have any superpowers other people don't. My only suggestion is that I take he "little and often" principle very seriously.</div>

<div class="content">In my mind, working 78 tasks in 3 days means I've been too scatterbrained and have not focused either on the important things enough or even on any one thing. Most of those 78 did not require action and some required more action than they got.  But just a little bit. If it was over 7 days I would think your numbers sensible for my context.  This is my experience - in the past I would have had lists that big, and often they grew. Now I keep it short and feel I get more done of what matters without neglecting stuff (time will tell).<br><br>Just a guess: those "large number of tasks outstanding"  didn't stand out because they weren't ready.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br><< Still, there are myriad things which should be done but not all should be done within the next two weeks.>><br><br>The trouble with this is that in two weeks time you will have another set of important things. So do you put the less important stuff off  for another two weeks? Oh no, you can't because you've got another set of less important stuff as well. When exactly are you going to have no important stuff to do so you can clear the backlog of less important stuff?<br><br>So why not just do both the important and the non-important stuff straight away? There doesn't seem to be any advantage in delaying the non-important stuff for over two weeks.<br><br><< With a short list, the balance between big and small is better. >><br><br>I'm not sure I agree with that. What actually happens with a short list I find is that the small stuff gets neglected with the result that it builds up backlogs which then distract from the big stuff. For instance, looking at my list is "Wash the dishes" small stuff or big stuff? If I leave it for two weeks, it'll be big stuff. The same with tidying my office, doing the filing, doing estimate and invoices, cutting the hedge, watering the plants, etc, etc, etc.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure I made it as clear as it should be what the problem is with putting small stuff off.<br><br>For ease of calculation assume that you have 50% big stuff and 50% small stuff, all of which needs to be done.<br><br>It would make sense to put the small stuff off for two weeks if no other tasks were going to present themselves during the period. But unfortunately that's not the case. New tasks will be arriving all the time.<br><br>So what happens is that you enjoy a honeymoon of two weeks in which you work only on the big stuff, but after two weeks you have another set of big stuff to do, plus a two week backlog of small stuff. Fairly quickly you will find yourself back spending 50% of your time on big stuff and 50% of your time on small stuff - only the small stuff will be two weeks late.<br><br>If you'd worked on all the tasks, big and small, from the beginning you would be in exactly the same position except that the small stuff would be up to date instead of being permanently two weeks behind.</div>

<div class="content">I don't see it that way. Rather by doing small stuff you have additional small stuff get added to the list simply by having made room. At simplest it's like if you clean everything every day you are making more work for yourself than if you clean weekly. Or if you go for a walk today you can also go for a walk tomorrow. If that's your priority it's fine. But these kinds of tasks don't go away just because you do them, and don't necessarily pile up if you don't.<br><br>The proverb is that work expands to fill the time available and so if you do more of the less important things you simply find more such things to do.<br><br>"Wash the dishes" isn't remotely big stuff on my scale. Big stuff is projects that take weeks at many hours per week.  Washing even if neglected for two weeks is just hours.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>Your answer puzzles me. If I have stuff which I only want to do once every two weeks or once a month, then I don't put it on my list, I schedule it.<br><br>Projects that take weeks at many hours a week are composed of small steps. If you have five large projects, then you can enter them as five tasks or as 500. Both approaches are equally valid. Neither as far as I can see is facilitated by deliberately failing to action them. <br><br>What can make sense is completing Project A before starting Project B and so on, but in that case why would you put the actions for Project B on your list before you are ready to action them?<br><br>Anyway I don't want to be too dogmatic in my reservations about DSAF.

<div class="content">Just a few things which have come to mind about DSAF since starting my trial yesterday:<br><br>1. Something very obvious which nevertheless I managed to miss - the review is going to contain some tasks which are two weeks old and some which are only one week old (and many in between of course). That's quite a time span, and means that tasks are going to be treated very differently depending on what stage of the week they are put on the list.<br><br>2. Since most people have a tendency to do the easy stuff first, the tasks which become subject to review will be largely made up of the more difficult ones. So the review process is not actually going to help weed out the trivia. I'd be interested to know whether that has in fact been people's experience.<br><br>3. If one is using DSAF in conjunction with AF1 (as I am), the review process is going to come at just the moment when AF1 is putting on real pressure to get the difficult tasks done. But instead of getting done, it appears that these tasks will be carried forward to the end of the list where there is little or no pressure.<br><br>------------------------<br>End of Day 2: 263 tasks of which 117 done, leaving 146 to do.</div>

<div class="content">To be clear I don't advocate DSAF.  Rather I simply think short is good so you can see the critical tasks more frequently and take conscious control. DSAF appears to offer that.  <br><br>In response to Mark's 9:31 post:<br>Scheduling tasks for the future is a good notion, but I resist fixing dates arbitrarily.  How many here do schedule such?<br><br>I have never intended to fail to act on a big project. Rather the issue was having too many little things clutter out the big things that demanded more frequent action.  The issue isn't  adding project B before it's ready. The issue is accumulating ideas for things that could be done faster than I clear them out. <br><br>My solution, which is nothing to do with DSAF, is to aggressively prune the old stuff by organizing into goal-oriented or subject-oriented projects. And even though there's no binding relationship between tasks in some of these, the volume is reduced in the AF such that the more complex projects (which do have a logical progression) stand out more and get their due attention. <br><br>Entering 5 (or 500) tasks of a big project into AF is something I've veered away from. Now I enter 1 and keep the rest elsewhere. They are all related and shouldnt be considered independently.  If I did otherwise, most wouldn't be ready for action.  Bur if multiple independent tasks are possible soon, I could enter more than 1.</div>

<div class="content">Hi <br>This is why I like working with a WILL DO list. They will be done. It doesn't matter how I do it. I happen to prefer a flexible weekly list from which to choose my Daily WILL DO focus list. Some people mark their WILL DO's from a master list.  It doesn't matter how one decides how they present the tasks so long as they get them done.  I switch off difficult with easy tasks or out and out breaks to prevent overwhelm....but they get done no matter how circuitous the route!  The DIT principles didn't make my work any easier to do but the principles applied make sure I do it. Even with my many modifications, it still works beautifully.  I, on the other hand, am not so graceful getting the stuff done.  I'm always relieved and relaxed once those MITs are off my plate and the week's work is progressing.  A few big bombs blowing up my life has put me behind temporarily but I ultimately know that things will be OK overall using my trusty WILL DO lists and my reviews...if I don't survive the surgery, my family won't be stuck sorting a big mess.

<div class="content">@Mark Forster:<br>You once proposed that if one has to make a decision, one should simply write all the options down on the AF list and let the "standing out" decide. (At least as I understood it.) IMO, this has a lot to do with how AF works: It helps me to get things done, but the even more important part is that it PREVENTS me from doing things! It's a decision process: Where do I put my time and energy?<br><br>This was the big insight when, after working with AF1 for a while, I looked on the dismissed pages and the items I did NOT attack because they never "stood out": In hindsight, I was glad I didn't in most cases, because they wouldn't have been worth it. This was when I really started to "trust the system". The AF process weeded them out, and I prefer it this way.

<div class="content">AndreasE:<br><br>First, let me say that I'm not trying to attack DSAF or discourage anyone from using it. The reason I've been trying it out is that an impressive number of people seem to have found it works for them, but I've always had doubts about whether it would work for me. But since it's very difficult to tell how something works just from reading about it I am at last trying it out.<br><br>There's also another aspect. I'm interested in *why* it works for others when it doesn't work for me (assuming it doesn't). That could have a lot of ramifications for the future evolution of systems.<br><br><< You once proposed that if one has to make a decision, one should simply write all the options down on the AF list and let the "standing out" decide. (At least as I understood it.) >><br><br>Yes, that's correct, though I think I said it was a possible way of making a decision, rather than something one should do.<br><br><< IMO, this has a lot to do with how AF works: It helps me to get things done, but the even more important part is that it PREVENTS me from doing things! It's a decision process: Where do I put my time and energy?<br><br><< This was the big insight when, after working with AF1 for a while, I looked on the dismissed pages and the items I did NOT attack because they never "stood out": In hindsight, I was glad I didn't in most cases, because they wouldn't have been worth it. This was when I really started to "trust the system". The AF process weeded them out, and I prefer it this way. Weeding out tasks CONSCIOUSLY is a lot like setting priorities, isn't it? >><br><br>Again this is correct. I probably went a bit far in answering Alan Baljeu when I said that I only put things on my list which I intend to do. But it would be true to say that I don't put things on my list which I have no real intention of doing. And the result of many years of working with AF in its various versions is that I tend to know what type of task the system is going to reject.<br><br><< From what you showed how you work yourself, I've got the impression that you approach things different from how I do it. I never managed to circle even modest AF1 lists several times a day, for example, and "little but often" has its limits for a lot of things I do.

So, maybe DSAF won't work for you as it works for me. >><br><br>I think it's important to realize that the "little" in "little and often" is a relative term. It's the opposite of "putting it off for ages and doing it all in one huge session at the last minute". So for a concert pianist "little and often" might be four hours of practice a day. Writing a novel "little and often" means working on it methodically every day, rather than having to burn the midnight oil as the publisher's deadline looms ever closer.<br><br><< Nevertheless, I'd like to suggest to try the FV-mechanism in combination with it. I do so sometimes. When I feel like doing so ;-)  >><br><br>You said in your description of the system that it didn't prescribe how to choose the tasks. So I'm using it with AF1 as that allows me a direct comparison with AF1's "dismissal" procedure. To be honest, most of the systems I've developed since AF1 have been in response to *other* people's problems with AF1. I've always found it works very well for me, and left on my own I would probably have stuck with it. This test gives me an opportunity to find out a bit more about why other people have problems with AF1.</div>

<div class="content">After 2 weeks the DSAF is still working with me. week 42<br>I have reported only 5 tasks from 2 weeks ago. and there is about 12 which are high lined (dismissed)<br>I am beginning week 44 I will see what will become with tasks of last week (week 41) <br>Anyway I still kept the right page of my spiral note book for quick notes. I also keep extensive notes with goes into my paper folder projects when there is one and in my binder if there is no paper folder. I also kept a kind of project list where I put my week's objectives. It was on my spiral note book it is now on my computer because I can see the evolution of each of them. It is a kind of short term list, a guideline of my most important aims. It is updated little by little.</div>
