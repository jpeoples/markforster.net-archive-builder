<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I came up with a simple productivity system which is highly influenced by this site. So first of all, I just wanted to thank Mark and everyone who posts here for their valuable insights.<br><br>Anyway, here's how it works:<br><br>When you're not sure what to do, roll a six-sided (standard) die...<br><br>1. Do ONE simple thing that will make the world a little better.<br><br>2. Do something that will make (TWO) tomorrow a little easier.<br><br>3. Do a bit of exercise. (Go for a walk, play a sport, stretches, some physical task you've been putting off, etc. (3 looks a little like an "E", so that's how I remember it.)<br><br>4. Get rid of 4 things. Don't do any tasks here. This is when you clean up your physical space or cross off items on your to-do list that are clogging up your mind.<br><br>5. Scan your immediate area (or list if you're looking at that) and do the first thing that stands out. (5 looks like an "S" which helps me remember "scan" or "stand out".)<br><br>6. Sit or lie down and close your eyes for 6 minutes. (I guess this would be meditate or rest, but I think it's important to not pressure yourself to "meditate correctly".) Simply give your mind and body these minutes to unwind. I think 6 minutes is long enough to clear yourself out, while also not being long enough to where it would be intimidating to start, like for 10 or 20 minutes.<br><br>If you roll the same number twice in a row, instead of repeating the action, treat yourself to something immediately fun. A YouTube video, browsing social media for a bit, a cookie, a treat, whatever you'd normally feel a little guilty for doing instead of work. Obviously don't do this for hours, but having a dedicated moment where you're allowed to do this I think is healthier than doing it when your willpower breaks down.<br><br>And that's it! For any of these actions, the idea is to do the first thing that comes to mind and trust the system to get to the stuff that's important. Obviously, if something is pressing or an emergency, you won't need to roll the die, but even if you stick with it when feeling pressure, I think #2, #5, and especially #6 will be helpful with anxiety.<br><br>Also, the randomness and potential treat if you roll the same number might hit that dopamine need that we're all wired with. Kind of like a slot machine that you pay for with chores and productivity, ha.<br><br>If anyone has any feedback or criticisms, I'd love to hear it. Feel free to be honest if it doesn't sound like it would work for you. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">I like it! Everything on the list is useful and doable. It's similar to the RWA system I'm refining, and adds a bit of randomness and fun.<br><br>The way you matched action to number makes remembering it easier -- so we can do the next thing instead of looking for the instructions and getting distracted.<br><br>Sigh. Android has many dice-rolling apps, but the only one that doesn't just put numbers on them makes you draw and install images.</div>

<div class="content">I also love the fun-factor of this! I could see myself using it on days when my brain is log-jammed and I don't know what to do first, or when I'm absolutely bored and don't know what to do first. Nicely done.</div>

<div class="content">I, too, think this is pretty neat! It has a pretty decent balance, I think, and it isn't too complex to be usable. Bravo.</div>

<div class="content">"6. Sit or lie down and close your eyes for 6 minutes. (I guess this would be meditate or rest, but I think it's important to not pressure yourself to "meditate correctly".) Simply give your mind and body these minutes to unwind."<br><br>Try 5-2-8 breathing and relaxing. Breathe in fully through your nose for 5 seconds, hold for 2 seconds and feel the air diffuse into your lungs, and out through pursed lips for 8 seconds (creates positive air pressure). While you are doing this, pay attention your face, jaw, eyes and relax them fully. Takes a bit of practice and it's amazing how quickly your jaw and face tenses up when you're not paying attention. Once you can breathe like that and keep your jaw and face relaxed, you'll be amazed by how recharged those 6 minutes will make you feel.<br><br>Incidentally you can use this method to fall asleep on demand, even in a noisy environnment. Same as above but also mentally repeat the phrase "Don't think" every couple of seconds while you breathe and relax. This halts the mental thinking that prevents sleep. Takes practice to get all tthree (breathing, total facial relaxing, phrase) going at once, but you'll find you're getting pre-sleep imagery and drifting off within a minute or so and then falling asleep.</div>
