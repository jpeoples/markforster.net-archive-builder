<div class="content">I am newer at SF than many here. <br><br>Mark has advised us not to put into SF things that we would do anyway. Are people complying with or violating this suggestion?<br><br>I can think of reasons why it would be good to violate this suggestion. But a good reason to comply is that I like the feeling of release and, yes, freedom that I feel when I occasionally go off the list during my workday.</div>

<div class="content">That's so we don't go to extremes writing things we don't need to write down.<br><br>If writing it down helps you, then write it down. Being able to cross it off is often enough incentive to get me to do things. Sometimes the act of listing everything I need to do, even silly things changing out of my housework clothes before going to a meeting, helps me focus and reassures me that I will leave myself enough time to do it on what could be a hectic, unfocused day.<br><br>Mark's sample day often includes washing dishes. That's routine and he'd probably do it anyways, but he chose to put it in the list.</div>

<div class="content">"I like the feeling of release and, yes, freedom that I feel when I occasionally go off the list during my workday. "<br><br>That sounds like a reason *not* to write it down, so you'll have more reason to occasionally go off the list?</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>You wrote a question and my response is "yes."<br><br>As I understand it, there are two official times that I am off-list. (When I am off-list, I am doing things that are not written on the list.) The two times that Mark has advised to be off-list are:<br><br>a. when my time schedule tells me to do a time-specific action, and<br>b. when I am doing something that I would do anyway.<br><br>Cricket has given two reasons to violate the advice to keep things I'd do anyway off-list. Feeling free of the list is a reason to comply with the advice to keep things I'd do anyway off-list.</div>

<div class="content">SF etc. is only for your discretionary time. So a valid reason to be off-list, even for an extended period of time, is that you have no discretionary time.  You might still want to carry your list around, to add things to it that come to mind.  But you don't need to work the list if your time is already committed.<br><br>When you have a lot of discretionary time, it sometimes makes sense to list routine tasks that you would do anyway, as a way of taking stock of all that you are doing.  And for some of us, it's easy to get absorbed in a fun and/or important task for hours, and forget to brush our teeth.</div>

<div class="content">SF isn't meant to nail you down and take away your freedom.  It helps enable your freedom and balance it with your other needs and responsibilities.<br><br>E.g., I doubt very much that Mark took his SF pad along with him on his 9-mile walks.  <br><br>SF can help us decide when we feel it is the "right" time to "break away".   E.g., enter lots of tasks like these:<br><br>- Take a long break doing nothing in particular<br>- Walk around the house and do whatever needs doing<br>- Take an hour to putter around in the garage<br>- Plan a weekend getaway and leave all your TM stuff at home<br>- Go talk to your neighbor<br>- Ditch work and go for a long drive<br>- Drive up to the Arboretum with the children<br>- Go spend some time at the monastery (if you happen to have a wonderful monastery nearby like we do!)<br><br>etc.<br><br>These items can all appear in SuperFocus just like anything else, but I don't think I'd bring my SF notebook along while I was doing those things...  Unless I wanted to capture random thoughts or something.<br><br>And here's a link to our local monastery, in case anyone else wants to visit!    <a href="http://www.stanthonysmonastery.org/index.php" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanthonysmonastery.org/index.php</a></div>
