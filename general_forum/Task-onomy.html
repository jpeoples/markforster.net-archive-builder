<div class="content">Hello.  A fundamtental element of all the systems is the TASK.  I seem to have a mental block, much like writers block I imagine, in breaking larger jobs (projects) into smaller chunks.  I wonder what hints and tips others might have...</div>

<div class="content">Mark's systems are very flexible, so do what works best.<br>1. Do you have to break it up?  Depending on the process and the project, you might get along just fine with just naming the project and calling the whole your task.<br><br>But if you get stuck on the big item: <br>2. Just write down the first thing you need to do.  Or any thing you need to do on that big item.  Or several things.  Whichever is easiest for you.<br><br>It's usually not effective to try to list every detail that needs doing up front, so don't.</div>

<div class="content">I would first think about what needs to be done next and write the task in an actionable way within a short time frame, like a day or less.  So even something like build a house can easily be broken down into smaller tasks.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">RogerL:<br><br>The mistake a lot of people make when breaking large jobs into smaller chunks is thinking that they need to break the entire project down. <br><br>In some cases this may be a good idea, especially if you want to write a checklist for someone else to follow or to ensure you don't forget any steps of a procedure. <br><br>But in the majority of cases, it is enough to write down just the first few steps as Alan says. As you progress, you can break it down further.</div>

<div class="content">Good question & it got me thinking:<br><br> The Pomodoro Technique may help here. If a task is less than 1 pomodoro (standard time is 25 minutes but can be altered to suit the user) then add it up with other tasks to make it up to 1 pomodoro, for example 'inbox to zero session'.<br><br>If the task is estimated to be greater than 7 pomodoros (7 x 25 minute sessions or approx 3.5 hours) then break it down, for example 'prepare report for presentation next week'. This could form part of a larger project like 'win acme contract'.<br><br>Personally, I find the Pomodoro Technique very difficult to use as a system, however I do feel this rule of thumb for task estimation and breakdown is useful.</div>

<div class="content">I really like pomodoros :)<br>If you can see that you can combine 2 different tasks in one pomodoro...<br>How more focussed can you be?<br>Also, a pomodoro for a relaxation activity is one of the most productive feeling I have ever felt...</div>

<div class="content">Many thanks for all the helpful comments.  Can I take this a step further and ask what a good way to write a task reminder is - what sort of language works best?  I sometimes don't find the way I've written a task reminder motivational enough because it still looks like - complete Project X rather than complete a smaller chunk of Project X.  If that makes sense?</div>

<div class="content">When I rewrite a blocked task I focus on making the first word a very concrete verb. Not "Complete..." as in your example above but a verb that is a clear, concrete action.</div>
