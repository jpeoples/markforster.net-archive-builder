<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>First of all, a hearty greetings to everyone -- I am back.  :)<br><br>I have a question about the 3-task system.  I find it compelling and quite useful to allow one to focus on important tasks/projects.  But do you still maintain a master list of some kind so that you do not forget things?  I certainly do not wish to rely on my memory anymore on what I have on my plate, so what do you do in this regard, Mark?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Glad to have you back David!<br><br>I think the "Ultra Simple Guide To Time Management" (USGTM) system by Gerry of <a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com/</a> would benefit much from this, if you are already familiar with it.  Mark's three-task system is based on using very broad task contexts.  Since USGTM has its contents already arranged by broad contexts, I think it would be perfect.  You would just have to add these to the rules:<br><br>1) You will need your USGTM notebook, pen, and some small post-its.<br>2) Reserve the very first page as the "Three Task System" page<br>3) Paginate each used page.<br>4) Write the title and first page number of each topic in the notebook to separate post-its, then stick each to the top of their respective page.<br>5) When you are to use the Three Task System, pick three topics which you will work on, stick their respective post-its to the "Three Task System" page, and work on them per Mark's rules.<br><br>Of course for this to make sense, you'd have to know what the "Ultra Simple Guide To Time Management" (USGTM) is; unfortunately you'd have to buy it from the link above. <br><br><<Thanks!

<div class="content">Welcome back David, I am pretty sure you have a copy of the USGTM.  <br><br>Focusing on three things has been very powerful for many people.  For me I do need the peace of mind that I have a complete capture of all that must be done some place.  I will however use a smaller list of three items isolated by themselves on a pad of paper to block out the distraction of a huge list and allow me to accomplish them.<br><br>Nuntym, please elaborate on how you are thinking of contexts in the USGTM system.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi, David<br><br>Welcome back!<br><br>I've been experimenting today with combining the three task system with AF4. I chose AF4 because it seemed to be the most compatible. <br><br>Bearing in mind that I have been using it for less than 24 hours, the results so far have been little short of sensational. As well as getting myself completely on top of the routine things (email, paper, doing the dishes, etc) I have also *finished* a couple of major projects which I think otherwise would have taken me days.<br><br>One of the most interesting things I have done today (from a time management perspective that is!) has been shredding a large pile of paper. There is a limit to how much paper one can shred at any one time because the shredder will overheat. So the task has to be done bit by bit. The system has been ideal for this purpose. "Shredding" has simply stayed as one of the three tasks for several hours and each time I come back to it the shredder has cooled down enough to reduce the pile a bit more.<br><br>It's also great for reading books, watching movies ("Pauline a la Plage" for me today), or other tasks where you can't spare the time to do the whole thing in one go.</div>

<div class="content">The method I have used to combine the 3-task system with AF4 is about as simple as it could be. First I select three tasks using the rules of AF4, then I switch to "3-task mode" and rotate around those three tasks until two of them are finished. Then starting from where I selected the last task on the AF4 list, I select another two and so on.<br><br>I don't re-write the tasks when I put them in 3-task mode. I do them in place by marking them with a large dot. Once I've finished the task, I cross it out and re-enter it if it's a recurring task.</div>

<div class="content">This all sounds good, Mark!  SO in essence, on could use almost any master task list system and add the 3-task rule to it.  AF4 may be ideal, but other systems would work too -- at least that is what it seems to me.<br><br>Thanks for the warm welcome back!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-3 18:48</div>
<div class="content">David:<br><br>I thought about this carefully before deciding on AF4, and the basic reason I decided on it was that it presents one with both a closed list and an open list. That means that you can't avoid the more difficult tasks, but can still get the more minor but necessary tasks done.<br><br>I rejected DWM because its format is designed to put pressure on  unfinished tasks. But since there won't be any unfinished tasks with the 3-Task principle, to use it with DWM would be pointless.<br><br>It might work with AF1, but I think DWM will produce more immediate beneficial results. However I am only guessing that - as I've said many times on this Forum you can't really judge a system until you've tried it.<br><br>You can apply similar thinking to other master task systems. Some will go better with 3-Task and some worse.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Thanks for the explanation -- it makes sense to me.  One more question....do you do the 3-task approach all day, or do you do for a period of time, switch back to regular AF4, then back again, etc.?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi. I recall right after the launch of AF1 that someone proposed picking a short list of important/urgent tasks from the AF master list to work from daily. Mark tried it as one of the very first tweaks to the system before discarding it because he was experiencing more resistance.  I'm afraid I can't find the relevant discussion thread - sorry.  <br><br>Just wondering whether 3-Task might fall foul of the same problem.  (Then again, I haven't tried 3-Task myself yet, so I should really just put up or shut up!)</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Gerry,<br><br>As far as I remember, USGTM espouses grouping what you write in the notebook: a topic/project/subject per page.  In Mark's original three-task system, the types of tasks that you put in the system are broad (eg. projects) therefore I thought your system would be perfect, as USGTM already has arranged all what it has in broad categories.  <br><br>Although now I see Mark has gone to a different tangent ^___^<br><br>-----<br><br>Mark,<br><br>Very interesting Mark!

<div class="content">Mark: when choosing 3 tasks from the AF4 list, if you are on working on the Closed List, you would *necessarily* have to pick them from there, is that right? And then move on the open list and pick 3 from there in order and circulating between the Open and Closed Lists in that manner.<br><br>Would that be the way you envisage working off the AF4 list? I was just wondering what if 3 tasks don't stand out in your Closed list to pick from (maybe just 1 or 2 stand out), do you then cross over to the open list and pick some from there?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-4 0:04</div>
<div class="content">JD:<br><br>When you pick a task for the 3-Task system, it's as if you had done it in AF4. So, no, you don't necessarily have to pick all three tasks all from the closed list and then all from the open list. If you are in the closed list and no more tasks stand out, then you move to the open list just as you would in AF4.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-4 0:49</div>
<div class="content">Thank you Mark.  For some reason, I took it that the 3 picks are to be treated a single whole and therefore need to come from one side of the list.<br><br>Like nuntym, I'm jumping in right away to test it out...</div>

<div class="content">The trick must be to get the level of detail in your task list right. I park a lot of stuff on the list as it occurs to me or as I go through mail. I suppose I could use this as a checklist and add broader projects as my tasks to do. This needs some thought.<br><br>If someone could put up an example, that would be helpful.</div>

<div class="content"><<The trick must be to get the level of detail in your task list right.>><br><br>Hi Will,<br><br>I would agree with you if the 3-task system were a stand-alone product, that you need task groups or projects in order to get the most out it.<br><br>Combined with AF, seems to me you can have any level of granularity. A big project can remain on the list for quite some time as you work on it, while you knock off some of the smaller items, which I might add has greatly increased my level of satisfaction with the system.<br><br>But I'd be mindful of Mark's advice on a big task: defining its completion is important, or else it can take up a slot for too long.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe I'm wrong, but for me Mark's 3-Task system and Alan's system have a lot in common: <br><br>Both systems use a AF-list with it's dismissal rules as a basis (AF4 for Mark, modified AF1 for Alan).<br><br>In both systems one does not work directly from the basis list, instead one needs to create a focus list with the items of the basis list using AF rules (in Mark's system only with special marks).<br><br>Actual work is done from the focus list. The main difference is the point in time when you are allowed to leave the focus list:<br>Mark's system: work until the 3-item list is down to 1 item<br>Alan's system: work on the focus list as long as possible<br><br>Do I understand the systems right?

<div class="content">Athough I'm finding AF4 reasonably satisfactory as the "base system" with the 3-task list, I'm wondering if a modified form of DIT would be better. I've got some ideas about how this might be done and will be trying them out. <br><br>I'll report back later!</div>

<div class="content">"Alan's system: work on the focus list as long as possible"<br>I should clarify I don't actually work as long as "possible", even though that's what I wrote.  <br><br>In fact, I stop as soon as something is pressing (something urgent came up, something important is now ready for more work, or I feel a need to get back to something I put aside recently).  <br><br>Also, I try to ensure I go through everything at least once a day to keep everything fresh.<br><br>The main practical difference between my approach and Mark's is this:<br>Mark picks two new items at a time, stops looking, and works on those.  I look through everything, and pick whatever stands out over the whole list.<br><br>It makes for a very different dynamic.</div>

<div class="content">Here is how I am trying this method out.<br><br>Firstly, I am using it as a time management not a goal management system.  I am using DO IT which already focuses on three longer term goals.<br><br>Conceptually, I have two "sections" to a single notebook.  I am using the last page as my three task system, writing three important items to finish during the day.  I am keeping the notebook open to this page during the day and working until I am down to one item or less, I then add two more.  At the end of the day this page is ripped out and a new one started using any unfinished items from it and the "capture" section of the notebook as choices for the new three task list.<br><br>The front of the notebook is what I call my capture section.  So it is for notes, other to-dos that pop up during the day or exist already, project lists, waiting for items etc.  It is designed just to make sure I do not forget anything and have all that needs to be thought about in one place, ie called into a meeting, need to jot notes, messages on the voicemail to take off, idea pops into head.<br><br>At the end of the day, yesterday, I reviewed the capture section, created my three tasks on the then last page and filed any notes and threw away any unneeded pages. <br><br>This could also work with an index card or separate sheet for the three tasks along with a single notebook or legal pad.<br><br>The only rules I am following are;<br><br>Keep the notebook open to the three tasks page unless you must add to the capture section.<br><br>all tasks go first into the capture section so there is no distractions from the current three tasks.  This serves are a review mechanism to select important items from the totality of what you must accomplish.<br><br>stay on the three tasks until there are only one or less before looking to the capture section to add more tasks.<br><br>make sure the three tasks are in fact actionable tasks you can do in a days time or less, so I am using words like, call Joe, read 3rd quarter report, review lease, make wire transfer to bank.<br><br>Write in this notebook only, so all you need to think about is in one place for simplicity<br><br>It seems to work for me because I have the sense of peace that all that ultimately must be done is captured and I am focused on what I believe to be the three most important tasks are at the moment.<br><br>At some point the notebook will run out and I will use this as an opportunity for a review of the unfinished task, notes etc.<br><br>After doing this yesterday, it seems like a simple system that will work very well.  I will keep using it and let people know.  If anyone has questions on this implementation, please let me know.  I will refine the instructions and post them to my blog, but I think this seems to work for me.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry,<br><br>It seems that using Mark's advice and any pointers from this forum everybody tries to come with something that would work for him/her.  Three tasks, focus page and so on.<br><br>I'm somewhat in the same area.  I run the master task list DMW style, at least I try, and it needs to be neat, otherwise I abandon it instantly.  I mark the task I need to do ASAP on the list, but I may also create additional lose leaf or note pad list of task to do each day.  This is discarded in the evening and a new list produced the next morning.  In the meantime, my DMW list updated as needed (and time permitting) but it's always reviewed twice a day, morning and evening.<br><br>Rands in Repose describes a similar system in which he calls the appropriate parts, Morning Scrub, Today List, Parking Lot (any incoming stuff) and Evening Scrub.  Scrub meaning the revision and update of the list.  He also has a Trickle List, a checklist of tasks that need to be done daily, particularly habit forming tasks that are not automated.<br><br>I really profit a lot from Mark's systems and the forum but my work seems to be more compatible with Rand's system and yours Gerry as well.</div>

<div class="content">I said this morning that I was going to try 3-Tasks out with a version of DIT. I came to the conclusion very quickly that I didn't like that. Then I tried it with AF1 and decided that I didn't like that either. So now I'm back with 3-Tasks and AF4, but I've simplified the way I combine them slightly which makes for a smoother ride. This is definitely getting close to my ideal time management system!</div>

<div class="content">I'm liking the 3-task list, although I fudged it and did one set of 4.<br><br>I had intended to make each set consist of an active task, an office task and a studying task, but it looks like I'm coming down with the flu so decided to concentrate on getting things ready for that rather than balance.<br><br>13 tasks stood out when I reviewed the lists for things I could do today or wanted to do today, totaling 10 hours, well beyond what I could fool myself into thinking I could accomplish in the 6 available. I copied those to a disposable list to keep my focus on them. Then I chose sets of 3 (or 4).<br><br>I chose the first set by asking what things would affect others before Monday. Three actives and an office. Done. They were also some of the longer tasks.<br><br>The next set I asked what would affect others in the next few weeks. Nothing. Months? One active and an office.

Then, when I was finished with two of those, I would pick two other "big things", but I would never get to have e-mail or paper as one of the three chosen. At least not for a couple of days. And then, some days later, some other "important" items would have come up, and alas no time for e-mail again.<br><br>However, as it was said previously on this thread, maybe the key is granularity and defining what "finished" looks like. Is that the underlying reason for the success of this method? I am still doing DWM (paper-saving version), but I thought of trying the "big-three" with it. I have got much better at finishing things since I started guiding myself by AFs, but not as much or as quickly as I would have liked.</div>

<div class="content">Ilse,<br><br>Thanks for your kind words.  I have been using the system I described strictly with tasks, not projects or goals, which is working great.  I stick to the rule that the item on the three task list must be a true task actionable in a day or less.  You will in fact get many more than three tasks done using this method.   I am using the capture part  simply to make sure nothing is forgotten, but it is serving as a buffer like in DIT which is another huge benefit.  However, the buffer time is not set, as once there are two slots open you can pull a task from the capture page, so it may be the same day or much longer.  <br><br>The idea for me is to keep three important tasks always on the list while not letting other tasks, ideas, or projects slip through the cracks.  I am almost done with a more detailed write up which I will post tonight, but so far I am very pleased with this new method.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">It sounds like we have a 3-Task list and a 3-Project list.<br><br>The 3-Task list is immediately do-able actions, and is emptied and refilled a few times during the day. Each time you're ready for another task, you refer to this rather than the longer lists, which saves time. It keeps you balanced by making it clear whether you are choosing similar tasks or a variety (sometimes similar is good, sometimes variety).<br><br>The 3-Project list is for things that will take many actions over several days or weeks. I'm trying to eat too many elephants at once. If I take a bite from each in strict rotation too much time is between bites (and some of the elephants regenerate -- slowly but steadily). I need to decide which 3 elephants I'm serious about. If I make sufficient progress on them early in the week, then I can play with other projects on Friday or keep pushing these till they're done, remembering that pushing too hard too fast on them might cause burnout.</div>

<div class="content">Hi All,<br><br>This forum just gets better and better!<br><br>Like many others here I tend towards procrastination - particular at times of overwhelm. I have used DIT for the past two years and this resulted in a vast improvement on my previous time management efforts. Most "failures" during this time were a result of my non-adherence to the system rather than the DIT system itself.<br><br>A few weeks ago I was prompted to switch to AF1. Mainly due to Mark's assertion that it was his favourite system. My productivity is much increased as a result of this change.<br><br>My principal remaining problem is that I still tend to revert to very efficient processing of the small stuff, to the detriment of the big actions that will move projects forward. <br><br>Will Mark's 3-Task system help in this? How can you best use the system to concentrate efforts on the important non-deadlined actions that are so easy to procrastinate on?</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>I am running the same way, triple task page at the back of the notebook, capture section at the front.  I try to stay on the triple task page as much as possible and go to the capture section when I must which is a meeting, an idea, voice mails, someone interrupts me etc.  It seems to really be working well for me.  I will study Marks demo in greater detail to see if I should tweak what I am doing, but right now I am very happy with the system.  Are you using a version of Triple Task?<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Anthony, Mark's 3-T can only help if you actually pick one or more of those big guys.  <br><br>As soon as you pick one, and define a specific short-term goal that you're committed to, you will find it easier to get it going.<br><br>Remember to pick things that "stand out".  That may include something you don't want to do.  It stands out because it's important and you haven't been doing it.  If you are able to start work on it now, define a mini goal and start doing that.</div>

<div class="content">hi gerry, <br><br>i'm using a timeboxed system of 3 items 1. inbox to zero 2. review items & 3. set up project...it's crude yet effective. <br><br>i really like the idea of isolating 3 tasks from the rest so i  may well give your version a go and see if it works for me, thanks.</div>

<div class="content">@Anthony: I want to mention Alan's suggestion is correct, so the issue is one of picking the big ones, the 'Results' type per Gerry's approach.<br><br>To assist me, I've classified each task per Gerry's approach in my two AF4 lists (Work and Personal): R = Results (where projects and other biggies lurk), A = Action items (can be done in one go at a sitting eg quick reply to an email) and W = Waiting (on others to get back to me).  <br><br>There is only one tag against each task, if an Actioned task becomes Waiting, then it's rewriiten on the list because I have completed my obligation for that task, even though the next response may require more Action/Results from me.<br><br>I've added E for Errands as a tag so I can pick some up on the way home after leaving the office.<br><br>My tags are set up in four columns on each RH page against the centre spine of my notebook with the task written on the LH page.  This helps me filter the Rs or As as I scan the list.  I have returned to using a Moleskine Large notebook (about A5) while trying out this AF4.3T approach<br><br>Maybe I should take a photo of a page and send it to Dropbox.<br><br>So the issue, as Alan states, is ensuring that one does indeed earmark the Big tasks.  Also worth remembering is Mark's emphasis on clarifying in one's own mind what constitutes completion.  Far from being an easy way to opt out of big projects, I find Mark's advice forces me to break down things into manageable bites - you've got to eat an elephant up to bite-size chanks only, but nibbling may take forever!<br><br>I have adopted the approach for now of making sure the first three tasks of the day are ALWAYS R tasks.  If I feel like a break from any of them, I can fill in the break with some Action items.<br><br>To answer others' questions about the current three focus tasks being 'depreciated' by other more pleasant tasks, I have taken up another member's suggestion and am writing my current three tasks on a Post-It note affixed to my notebook computer.  As I work mostly standing at my desk, it's always visible.  I try not to look at the AF4 list until I have completed at least two of the current tasks, except when I am adding a new task on the Open list, but even then I try to get right back to the Post-It note.<br><br>Mark states in his new rules that one can cycle round and round the current three tasks until two are deemed completed (however defined, see other posts!).<br><br>My first task of the day has had three bites at it so far as it involves redrafting an Excel spreadsheet from a consolidated approach to a more numerous individual perspective.  I have to make sure that the sum of the parts still adds up in the summary.  It's not exciting work, so I do a few changes, then move to one of the other current tasks.<br><br>Right now another current task is in progress, but as it's a reformatting of my wife's netbook, it is running concurrently with the other two.<br><br>Onwards and upwards as some folks say.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger & all - I've moved all "waiting" tasks to my tickler program (outlook). It was a huge distraction having them on my list. Unless there needs to be a specific date by which I need the person to come back to me, I set an arbitrary due date on them without a reminder. I set a task to review my Outlook task list on the AF list, or just have an Outlook task with a reminder to review the list.<br><br>On the issue of picking tasks, isn't the system itself supposed to do that for us? The reason why I feel so much freedom from prioritising, choosing or picking tasks that I am about to do is because AF does such a brilliant job of doing it for me by means of the intuition I put to work in letting the tasks come to me, rather than chasing them down.</div>

<div class="content">I think you're right, JD.  I just checked, and several times people talked about picking "big" items.  I'm not sure whether that's a problem or not, but I would think people should just grab whatever comes along, including both big and small.  What does people's experience with the 3T system suggest?</div>

<div class="content">JD, Alan et al:<br><br>I wrote that I start the day with three Results Tasks which is a way of trying to combat distractions.  I'm finding this approach gives me some sense of achievement and progress towards doing the things for which I am paid.<br><br>I guess it's a conscious approach at the start of the day, but even then I let my intuition come into play though I'm still focusing on the R tags.<br><br>At other times, I can ignore the tags and go with the flow.<br><br>I'm more at peace with AF4.3T and in the end we must do what works for us.  Too often in my life I've let other people/things dictate to me regards modus operandi.<br><br>Waiting: funnily enough I often use what JD describes, set up an Outlook reminder and then cross it off the paper list in the knowledge that Outlook will bring it back to me when I asked for it.  I even wrote a task today tagged as an Action, "Set reminder for 3 December to download visa form"<br><br>I think I'll do it now and cross it off!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger - Love that moniker "AF4.3T" - good enough to be the newest turbo version of the already powerful V6 Autofocus all terrain Task vehicle, don't you think?!<br><br>Totally agree that the mileage varies and we apply the little variations to make things work for us.</div>

<div class="content">The idea of the waiting for was one of the GTD ideas I really like.  As a manager it trains your people to follow through when they know you are tracking what they owe you.  <br><br>One way to handle W items in in Triple Task is to turn them into Actions.  For instance if someone owes you a report which is a W, you can put into your system as call Joe about the overdue 3rd quarter report.  Then when you have waited too long for the report it moves into the TT section and gets done, if he follows through just cross it out.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all for your thoughts and advice.<br><br>I have a hesitation in switching from AF1 so soon after starting the system - chopping and changing TM systems appears to me (from the experience of others on this forum over the years) to be the road to productivity disaster.<br><br>AF1 has been a major advance for me over DIT (which is still a great system in my view).<br><br>So Mark's latest post is very timely for me, and I will wait to see if his trial of incorporating 3-T into AF1 is a success.</div>

<div class="content">Anthony:<br><br>In fact it's not about incorporating 3-T into AFf1. More a matter of making a simple change to AF1 in order to give it a similar amount of focus as 3-T has.</div>
