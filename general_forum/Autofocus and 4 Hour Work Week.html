<div class="content">Mark, thank you for your new system - I am loving it so far this morning - will give more feedback as it sinks in . . .  It seems to me that pen/paper or word doc are the way to go for Autofocus, as PDAing seems to overcomplicate the beautiful simplicity (I'm a strong believer that life is simple - it is us who insist on making it complicated!!).  However, I do have two questions:<br><br>1) A thought for those following Tim Ferriss's philosophy in 4 hour work week- It might be worth asking the question "If I could only do one task on here today what would give me satisfaction?" Would this undercut the system by shifting the weight to teh rational too much?<br><br>2)  I traditionally spend 2 hours each morning on key focus areas (Mon - Presentation, Tues - Staff; Wed - Communications and Marketing; Thurs - New Frontiers).  Each week I select items for each of these.  Would you see Autofocus being a part of these, or having this two hour preselected time being additional?<br><br>3) I think PDA's etc are perfect for calendars, ticklers and a place to store valuable info.  Thus they become a separate tool<br><br>Thanks for any thoughts you have!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Glad you are getting on well with the system, Mark. In answer to your questions:<br><br>1) My initial reaction is that it wouldn't be as effective as the system as designed. I've tried out many of these sorts of questions in the past and have never found them very effective, particularly in the long run.<br><br>2) I don't see any problem with having focus sessions at pre-determined times. Any actions coming out of them would of course be entered in the system.<br><br>3) I'm a paper and pen person myself, but I'm sure you're right!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark - A further question . . . The only thing that bothers me here is parkinsons rule - that work expands to fill teh time you give it - i am nervous that I will accomplish less tasks without putting the boundary of "How would I do this if I could do it in 1 hour?" on it - do you have any thoughts on this?<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>PS - Are you coming to speak in the states anytime soon?</div>

<div class="content">My experience has been exactly the opposite. I've got a lot more done in a shorter time. See how you get on.<br><br>P.S. No plans at the moment - but I'm keeping all such questions until I see how the system is received.</div>
