<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I'm hoping to get some other perspectives on making the Autofocus more consciously goal-oriented.<br><br>Someone on the discussion board mentioned Alan Lakein's system of identifying  goals in "How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life" - so I pulled out my tattered and highlighted copy of the book to refresh my memory.  <br>Here's the Coles Notes version:  Basically, you should identify your lifetime goals, medium term goals (3 - 5 years) and "if you were going to die in 6 months" goals.  <br>Take 2 minutes to jot down a variety of goals for each scenario and then another 2 minutes to refine them.  <br>For each scenario, select your top 3 goals, giving you 9 goals.<br>For each goal, list as many activities (tasks) as you can as quickly as possible in 3 minutes - no censoring.<br>Next Alan Lakein recommends scheduling your priority tasks that you've committed to spending 5 minutes on today/this week.  Scheduling... hmmm... not gonna happen.<br><br>So if one wants to work with AF and not schedule work on the goals, how do we put the goal activities into the Autofocus system?  One way I think works is to take the highest priority goals and put lots and lots of tasks for them into the system.   That's what I did at the beginning of the year/beta testing, but I'm not sure that my top 2 goals haven't overridden my other goals because of this method.  Maybe that's because it really is difficult to put a lot of energy behind more than a couple of big goals at a time.  As well, achievement of those big goals will lead to the possibility of achieving other long term goals in the future so success is critical.  <br><br>Any other thoughts?  Anybody else working on their goals with AF?  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>There was another post on goals a while back which made me think and yours has also touched on an idea that has been forming in my mind.  I know there has been mention of AF being a bottom up approach but I have a feeling - just an embryonic thought really - that this could also hold true for goals.<br><br>My "goals" had been on the back burner for a while as a result of outside factors, but the basic concepts of what I wanted to achieve have been within my project system.  It seems to me that AF has given me back focus on what is really important in my life.  When goals were mentioned previously I had the flash thought that I "ought" to redefine my goals but then an instinctive feeling that that wasn't the right thing to do.  My gut instinct as it were now is to hold off on goal setting per se - I just have the feeling that as AF is prompting me to redefine my "projects" it is actually enabling me to see what is important, amd I believe that my goals will become apparent without my having to force them. <br><br>Even just thinking along those lines seems strange - my concept of a goal is something I have made a conscious decision to aim for, and therefore plan the route.  This feels more like the fact that I have already decided on my goals, but at a deeper, subconscious level that will become clearer in due course and that those goals are the "right" goals.<br><br>Does that make any sort of sense - bit drastic I know!</div>

<div class="content">Everyone is working towards a goal at all times, even self-gratification can be a goal, it's whether they've made a conscious decision to accept that goal or not.  I'd rather live a bit more consciously.<br><br>Having said that, I also respect Mark's opinion in his blog of a year ago which is similar to yours:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/1/11/goalless-living.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/1/11/goalless-living.html</a><br><br>I'm no longer of the belief as I was years ago that I can map things out and plan 20 years ahead.  If some things are a massive struggle and don't flow easily, maybe they're not meant to be.  But most professionals - artists, writers, entrepreneurs - that I respect had big goals and were people that pushed through long periods of struggle and were also the survivors in their field.  <br><br>I would suggest that perhaps if your goals aren't appropriate for you or well-defined or conflicting, they won't be of any value to you.  I'd rather not be at the mercy of other people's goals and agendas however.  And that's what can often happen if you don't have any of your own.  <br><br>And a goal can be as simple as following interesting paths to see where they may lead and being open to new opportunties.  Maybe not quite as drastically as the movie "Yes Man", but something along those lines.<br><br>There is a link to the commencement address that Steve Jobs gave that's linked in the comments to the post I've linked above - I've read a biography and numerous articles on Jobs - here's an excerpt in Wikipedia:<br><br>Jobs has always aspired to position Apple and its products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting trends, at least in terms of innovation and style. He summed up that self-concept at the end of his keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007 by quoting ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky:[40]<br><br>“ There's an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. 'I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.' And we've always tried to do that at Apple. Since the very very beginning. And we always will." <br><br>That's what I'm trying to do with setting goals and living a more creative life - figuring out where I want the puck (my life) to go and now using AF to help me get there.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">The Laiken goal setting exercise is really a bottom up kind of exercise.  The brief summary above left out the part where you brainstorm about all the things you want to do, with no censorship.  As he says stuff might come out like: Eat a gallon of ice cream, climb Mt. Everest, hike the Appalachian Trail, marry a supermodel, be in the book of records as the best Guitar Hero player, etc.  The whole point of the exercise is to flush out your subconscious desires.<br><br>The first step is not so much "goals" as desires".  Once you have pages and pages of items (note that the brief summary leaves out many steps in the process that will generate many filled pages of scribbling) you scan the list and start to look for themes.  In the brief example I gave there was "climb a mountain" and "go on a six month hike".  Assuming that were the entire list those would stand out and get me thinking that maybe I really yearn for a life as an adventurer.  (Just to go with this for a moment ;-)<br><br>Once I cull the list (editing comes as the second phase ... I throw out the obvious nonsense and look for themes) I see that there are maybe a half dozen things that are speaking to me that I had not realized because they got lost in the daily noise.  (How do you know you want to be an adventurer if you are working late every night doing reports and spreadsheets?)<br><br>Next you do some more serious thinking and really come up with what you think are GOALS.  Maybe I've always loved mountain climbing but at my age perhaps it is out of the question.  Maybe there are some goals that make more sense for my context.  You can only know this by really giving it some thought.  (This exercise, done completely and thoroughly takes a good deal of time ... living with your lists and working through your dreams and desires.)  In any case, the idea is to winnow it all down to a few big GOALS that you think you want to go after NOW.<br><br>Once you have the goals, you "schedule" them, according to Laiken's TM approach.  But if you are not using his approach, why not just put them into AF?  You don't have to throw out his goal setting method just because you are not going to use his scheduling system.<br><br>But before you even schedule them it makes sense to work in time frames.  For example, if you really do want to climb Mt. Everest, you are not going to do it next week!  It is probably going to be a years long (probably decades long) project.  So you lay out a broad brush time line.  Personally, when I did this some decades ago, I laid out lifetime goals, 20-year goals, 10-year goals, 5-year goals, 3-year goals, yearly goals, goals for the next six months, the next three months, and the next month.  So <br><br>"To have lived a life of adventure" might be a lifetime goal ... <br>"To have climbed Mt. Everest" might be a 20 year goal ... <br>"To have climbed mountains Z, Y, and Z" might be my 10 year goal ...<br>"To have gone on a mountain climbing expedition" might be my 5 year goal ... <br>"To be qualified in all phases of mountain climbing" might be my 3-year goal", <br>"To have finished my first course in mountaineering" might be my 1-year goal ...<br>"To have completed the prerquisites for a mountaineering course" might by my 6-month goal ...<br>"To have enrolled in a mountaineering course" might be my 3-month goal ... <br>"To have researched what is involved in mountain climbing" might be my 1-month goal.<br><br>Notice that is not so much a really detailed plan, but a broad brush brainstorm about how I might go about it knowing very little other than that I THINK that I may want to do it.  I'm quite sure that the plan will change as I become more educated, take courses, go on trips, etc.  I may take a nasty fall in my first rock climbing outing and break a leg and decide that this whole idea is nuts.  Maybe I want to make movies about other people climbing ;-) ;-)  But the real point is that I have flushed out a deep desire that I had not known was there and set my feet on a path.  Where I end up will depend.  There is nothing that says I MUST stick to the plan or the plan can't change.<br><br>And notice that what I have done so far is not "scheduling" so much as it is planning based on my current state of understanding.  The scheduling, assuming AF, would look something like this:<br><br>- Call Joe about his friend Pete (who climbs mountains)<br>- Buy climbing magazines (to learn the jargon and find ads for schools)<br>- Call Schools<br>- Find books and DVDs about all aspects of it<br>- Visit REI and look at cool hardware and togs ;-)<br>- Tell everyone I now that I'm going to climb Mt. Everest someday (and notice my internal feelings as I take feedback)<br>- Etc.<br><br>Will any of this happen?  Who knows?  But one thing that WILL happen is that I will know that I have this feeling about adventure and I have done something to try to learn more about  it.  That's good, no?  I will learn how strong that interest really is if I start dismissing those tasks (like calling schools).  In the end, it might be a false goal ... just a dream ... but at least I'll have found that out.  Perhaps it is real ... if so maybe in a couple of years I'll have packed up and moved to the mountains so I can climb every day and build up my stamina and skills in preparation for that Everest expedition ;-)<br><br>Re: Everyone is living one's goals.  I disagree.  It seems a bit tautological to define a goal as anyplace one winds up because on is alive and doing SOMETHING.  By definition, goals are planned.  The plan may change ... life is not static.  But to have a goal is to plan.  I'm not advocating that everyone have a lifetime or 20-year plan.  That is just how I did it.  I think, however, if one does not plan ones goals one drifts.  After all, what is there to get you to switch off the TV after a hard day's drudge to spend a few minutes of precious time moving in the direction that will bring deeper happiness?  IMO, only having worked out the goals, laid out time frames, revisited the plan to check progress and felt satisfaction or frustration ... both of which are motivational.<br><br>Just a few thoughts and, as always, YMMV.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I've been giving this some considerable thought since your initial post and thank you for the pointer to Mark's blog post - I had missed seeing that one.  I totally agree that the planning and steps of our goals are an important part of the process but I am coming more to the conclusion that there are different types of goals, or more specifically objectives.  I am reminded to listen to that "still small voice" which can so often get drowned out in the busyness of life.<br><br>I do think there are definite goals that need definition (no pun intended!) and need the steps to me mapped out to facilitate progress.  However I think there are also goals which are more akin to "being on the right path".  Once we know we are on the right path then the route markers are less necessary - we just keep on that path.  The only time that that path or goal needs mapping out is if a change of direction occurs or is required (not necessarily the same thing!).  Sometimes we just wander off course and need a map to get back - sometimes we get knocked off course and sometimes there are obstacles to manoevre around.<br><br>On the other hand I think that AF is enabling us to have the space to identify some of the goals that we have perhaps lost sight of.  I really do not feel a need (or even a desire) to reset or map out goals, regardless of how non-directional that seems.  I am really starting to feel that my genuine goals, those goals that I know, or will know, instinctively are right for me, will become clear, sometimes maybe only by looking back, but for now my "responsibility" is "just" to be on the right path ...........<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Just seen your post, it wasn't there when I started my post - the downside of leaving your computer unattended mid-post!<br><br>Interesting point about looking for themes and the excellent descriptions of the thought and planning process.  What I love about this sort of identification and planning, which AF is so ideal for, is that it seems so natural and unforced - it's not "well I love adventure therefore I must climb Mount Everest" but "hmmm, I love adventure - I think mountain climbing would really satisfy that and hey, maybe I should think about climbing Mount Everest!"  <br><br>I love the way in which you describe the process of perhaps letting go of a perceived goal (false goal or just a dream).  If we don't learn to dismiss those false goals we will just be left with a feeling of disatisfaction and missing out.  If we consciously recognise that mountain climbing is not for us we will not find ourselves feeling we have "wasted our life" because "what we really wanted to do was climb a mountain".<br><br>For me - for now - I will certainly look for themes and see where my "dreams" "hopes" aspirations" "goals" take me but I'm not going to try to map out a whole schedule of A to B in x timescale.  That may well come in the future but for now I'm just gonna enjoy the ride!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br><br>I love your image of being content to be on a path in life.  Often there appears to be no destination, but it seems so right to be moving on a satisfying path.<br><br>Another image I have been toying with as I read this thread is that sometimes my life is like a garden.  There are lots of lovely trees, some exquisite little plants (and also a few weeds).  All of these precious elements began their lives as little seeds.  Many of the seeds germinated and have grown to be things of great wonder.  In so far as I have tended the garden carefully, the whole thing has grown to be something I can be proud of.<br><br>According this image, AF is perfect for detecting signs of new growth, identifying ways of nurturing the processes of growth towards maturity, weeding out things that are not nice and in general fashioning a life that is a true expression of much of my natural giftedness.<br><br>This image lends itself to a "bottom up" approach to managing myself in life.  I truly believe that though some of my achievements have come about because I had clear goals and worked methodically towards those goals, far more of what I value in my life has been more like a glorious accident that has come about because I have been faithful to many very little things. <br><br>AF is just so good at encouraging this gentle but steady attention to becoming and achieving.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim<br><br>That's a great way of putting it - I love the garden imagery, and your comment "far more of what I value in my life has been more like a glorious accident that has come about because I have been faithful to many very little things". <br><br>I really believe that some of the goals we end up setting or even wishing to set can only come about because we have been "on the right path".   I would never, ever, have set a goal to work in the industry I did, not for any lack of belief, or even lack of imagination, but for the simple reason that I never even knew that industry existed! <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike,<br><br>That's an excellent description of defining goals, a little different from my version of Lakein's book, but still effective.  <br><br>I respectfully disagree that Lakein's method is bottom-up - how can determining a lifetime goals statement be bottom up?   What you describe is pretty much what I do during every Christmas break and on my birthday, which fortunately falls mid year.  <br><br>Lakein also makes the distinction (and I agree) that:<br>"In one way or another, whether you have been explicitly thinking about it or not, you have been thinking about your lifetime goals almost as long as you have been alive.  However, thinking about your goals is usually quite a different experience from writing them down.  Unwritten goals often remain vague or utopian dreams, such as "travel" or "becoming a millionaire."  Writing goals down tends to make them more concrete and specific and helps you probe below the surface of the same old cliches you've been telling yourself for years."<br><br>I made a modification to my goal-setting process over a year ago during an excellent leadership course  I attended (the course led to my quitting the company 2 months later - apparently that often happens).  <br><br>The exercise resulted in a timeline of significant events in the past and achievements you wanted to accomplish in the future.  When I did the timeline though, I had only 3 goals for up to 2010 (nothing beyond 2010 other than game over at some - hopefully far - future point) - at that time 2 years into the future: <br><br>- to semi-retire by 2010 (fully retire from working for others unless it's a consulting job I'm very interested in), <br>- take an 8 month sabbatical travelling in my motorhome<br>- to find the next place I want to live<br><br>I feel fully confident that once 2010 rolls around, I'll develop other, more concrete goals to follow based on my new path - but at this point, other than a general direction, I have no idea of the opportunities that could arise or the people I could meet that would change my path.  Since that exercise done in 2008, I've been involved in restructuring and winding down a bankrupt company (no way could I have predicted that would happen), a friend with an interesting job that needs a lot of re-tooling (what I'm good at and love doing) got pregnant and is going on maternity leave for a year and begged me to take her position during her time off, and the housing market where I live went crazy, giving me the opportunity to unload my house if these prices remain artificially high, thereby allowing me to fully retire if I want.<br><br>If I look back at my various lists of goals over the last 15 years or so, many of them were achieved without my systematically working on them other than superficially (eg. buy a motorhome). Because I only went through spurts of activity in working on my goals though, many could have been achieved by now but haven't been (the really big, scary ones that required me to push my limits).  I think that's because I've always tried and failed at the recommended advice of scheduling work on them.  Then the schedule gets interrupted and I get pulled into someone else's agenda (usually involving lots of overtime).  This is why I'm kind of annoyed that Mark didn't come up with this AF stuff 15 years ago.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>I did not describe the exercise completely, I just attempted to add something to what you covered.<br><br>Re: Bottom up ... it is bottom up because your goals are not derived from large lofty ideas, but looking at what you feel you'd like to do if you only had six months to live, etc.  That is bottom up ... starting from small desires and abstracting to larger concepts.  At the point where you have defined the goals, the process is indeed top down.  All planning is top down, once you have the goal in mind.<br><br>I like a lot of what Laiken has to say but that statement about thinking about goals is just daft.  Just watch an episode of Jay Leno's "Jay Walking" to convince yourself of that ;-)  Most people drift from day to day, week to week, decade to decade and never put two thoughts together.  That exercise is a great tutorial on just how to do it.<br><br>What most people DO have is dreams ... ill formed emotional visions of what they would like the magic fairy to do for them.  Win the lottery.  Get an inheritance.  Get a big promotion with no clue about what the boss wants or what the job really is!  Sound like the people you talk to?  ;-)  (Of course, if you are in the arts ... I may be thinking of someone else here, ... you may be dealing with a higher class of people ... meaning people who have to visualize an end state and bring it to fruition ... just to put food on the table.)<br><br>Leadership course:  ROTFLMAO ;-) ;-)  I've always wondered about that.  I have been through umpteen million of those courses ... it seems as though my company gave them every year.  The words of the speaker were opposite of what the company really wanted of its employees.<br><br>Your goals:  I would call those short term goals ... and that's fine.  Sometimes things just come really close and it takes everything to deal with that.  But look at my mountain climbing example.  You don't get there by looking at what you want to do in the next three years but nothing beyond.  In fact, the goal itself argues against that.  It is not a short term goal.<br><br>I had a goal to retire early and did so.  It was one of those things that was a medium term goals and I only had some vague ideas of how to do it.  It happened gradually because of various economic conditions that motivated companies to downsize by instituting early retirement programs.  It was not the kind of thing I could have worked at intensively ... well, at least I did not see how to do it ... basically I positioned myself and kept my eyes open for the opportunity.  On the other hand, I would never have got a pilot's license by drifting into it.  It took a lot of planning, budgeting and research coupled with dedication to go out several times a weak to fly.<br><br>Getting pulled into someone else's agenda: That is WHY one plans ... having a plan has always allowed me to see that I was being pulled off my goal and find a way around the problem.  If I depended on serendipity to get me to a pilot's license, I'd never have taken the first course ... I'd have been working overtime (and trust me, overtime is the rule in the software industry) rather than telling my management that I had an appointment.  If you don't manage your own time to reach your own goals, someone else will manage it for you to reach theirs.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Mike, <br><br>What's even worse is when *they* get you to follow their really poorly thought out goals that advances their career rather than a project. :-)<br><br>I've worked with engineers throughout too much of my career to probably ever abandon a linear, practical approach - oil refineries don't get built on intuition and visions.<br><br>I moved towards more short-term planning for myself (2 year or so) because I found that when I started doing process improvement work on the finance systems for a company I used to work at, what worked the best seemed to be to resolve some of the smaller issues first (eg. what would make the next month end go faster - and repeating this over and over again), freeing up the time so we could work on solutions to the big things.  It also seemed like once the small irritations were put out of the way, the team became more creative with solutions in general.  <br><br>I also feel I need to focus on the fairly near future on an ongoing basis because I've had people in my family die at a pretty young age from freak accidents, illnesses and such. About 2 years is something I can keep focused on quite clearly.<br><br>What do you think about shortening up the time to do things?  What I mean is what if you could climb the mountain in the next 2 years, but by thinking it's something far away in the future you don't progress towards it as fast as you could if you hadn't told yourself it would take 5 years?  <br></div>

<div class="content">I've posted about this before, but I read Your Best Year Yet this past August and using the book as a guide, came up with 10 goals for the year. Because I use ToodleDo for my AF lists, it's easy for me to review my list each evening and mark those that have to do with my ten goals with the corresponding goal. This would be possible with many digital programs that don't include goals, using the goal as the context or tag. Using ToodleDo, I can see the number of tasks completed per goal. This gives me a general idea of how I'm progressing.<br><br>For those using paper, you might make your list of goals and the steps to get there and either a) Put review goal list for tasks on your AF list or,<br>b) Put Work on Goal #1, Goal #2, etc. on your AF list.<br><br>I don't believe that simply working an AF list will automatically have you do what is most important and/or reach goals. I do think we have to spend time actually considering our goals and commitments. That's the big disadvantage of AF as compared to DIT. DIT requires you to get real and see how much time you actually have. You quickly conclude that you can't do it all and you must pare down your commitments. With AF, you can continue to add commitments that have nothing whatsoever to do with your goals. It's true that tasks are automatically filtered and some are dismissed, but why is it the case that these items are necessarily the least important to you? <br><br>Having true goals and tracking progress helps you to go ahead and work when you don't really feel like it. When "tag digital photos" pops up on my AF list, I remember that my goal was to get several years' worth of photos tagged. It helps that task feel "ready" to be done because I don't want to fail in my goal. If I had no top-down goal, I would probably choose another task. I think there has to be a balance between doing what you feel like doing in the moment and doing those things you most want to do long-term. I feel my system is giving me that balance.</div>
