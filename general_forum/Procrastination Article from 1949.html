<div class="content">M.ark<br>If I'm not mistaken there is a link on Prof Perry's site to that article-I think it was his dad who wrote it but I may be wrong.<br>Jay<br></div>

<div class="content">Jay:<br><br>If there is, I can't find it. Robert Benchley, who was a very well-known comic writer in his time - I remember reading tons of his stuff as a youngster -  had only two recorded sons, neither of whom was called John Perry. His grandson Peter Benchley wrote the best-seller "Jaws" on which the movie was based.</div>
