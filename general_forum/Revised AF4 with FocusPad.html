<div class="content">For the few (sadly :() of you who are using FocusPad on iPhone for Autofocus (<a href="http://7actionsdev.com/focuspad/)," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://7actionsdev.com/focuspad/),</a> and would like to implement the revised AF4, this is actually very simple. Much simpler than Super AutoFocus actually.<br><br>What you do is the following...<br><br>Preparation:<br>1) Rename the pad you are currently using on FocusPad for new tasks to 'Old / New' or something like that and convert it to a 'fluid' pad, if it is not a 'fluid' pad yet.<br>2) Add a line at the end of this pad (typing any number of '-'s will convert it to a line) to separate the old tasks from the new tasks.<br>3) Create two more 'fluid' pads called 'Recurring' and 'Unfinished'.<br><br>Using it:<br>1) Whenever you want to add a new task, go to the 'Old / New' pad and add it at the end.<br>2) When you finish a task in the 'Old / New' task, mark it as done and copy it to the 'Unfinished' pad if it's not finished or to the 'Recurring' tab if it's a recurring task. You can use the 'Move/Copy' thingie to do that.<br>3) Use the 'Mark as done and add again' button to re-enter unfinished or recurring tasks in their respective pads.<br>4) When all tasks on a page have been dismissed or done, delete the page.*<br><br>* If you want to keep a record of all your tasks, use 'fixed' pages instead of 'fluid' pages and tag any finished pages with the little diamond in the lower right corner. You can then hide or show those with the page button in the lower left corner.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Tijl,<br><br>Thanks for posting your system in detail.  Unfortunately, it appears to require the beta version of FocusPad, which I don't think is generally available.  I'd love to be proven wrong on this, as I'd love a copy myself!<br><br>I agree with you about what a great program FocusPad is.  It's a pity that Tony hasn't kept developing it...the FocusPad mailing list hasn't had any postings at all for the last three months.  I might ping Tony and see if I can get the beta version, and also ideally ask him to fix some bugs (it crashes regularly while flipping between pages) but at present it looks like you're one of the lucky few who can use the "fluid" page format.  That's not available on version 1.2.2, which is all you can get via the iTunes store...</div>
