<div class="content">Hi Mark/everyone...<br><br>I have just recently revisited Mark's DIT and it really has 'clicked' with me this time... I love the 'closed list' approach, I have now declared a rather large backlog and am using it as the 'current initiative' which I did this morning, first thing before anything else and actually achieved something I have been putting off for quite a while now!<br><br>The book is just genius, I love reading it and my whole approach now to my work is going to be based on this book...<br><br>If you're listening, thank you SO much Mark!</div>

<div class="content">DIT is the work of a genius. Except perhaps for Dave Allen, there has been no one in the past 50 years or so who has come up with an original idea on how to manage time that truly and consistently works. Mark Forster's book contains so many novel ideas (such as 'declaring backlog' and getting your current work under control, "little and often", "closed lists" and "limits") that are so original that one would not find them anywhere else. DIT is the only system that ever worked for me (and is still working). There was no one more surprised than I when I completely and without effort cleared my inbox of over 6000 emails in a month by taking it as my current initiative. My inbox now doesn't have anything except that day's email. For me, there is no better system for managing your life  than DIT - not even Autofocus in all its glory and many versions.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Chuck,<br><br>You are exactly right about Mark.  I've followed time management systems for decades now and Mark is one of the few who has developed NEW ideas.  Most other systems are repacking of ideas from other systems with new terms.  David Allen also had a few new ideas as well.  Personally, I take from each what works for me.  Mostly I use a simple prioritized To Do list.</div>
