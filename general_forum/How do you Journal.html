<div class="content">I love journaling and my life changed since I started doing it a couple of years ago. <br>I'm creating a service, and I am looking for people who are willing to answer some questions about Journaling:<br><br>¿How often do you journal?<br>¿Do you use journaling prompts or any specific journaling technique?<br>¿Do you use a specific software (Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc) or do you use pen and paper?<br>¿Do you save your old journals?<br>¿Do you revisit and read your old journals?<br><br><br>The service would work like this: <br>1. You receive an email with a journaling prompt every morning. <br>2. You reply to the email every day with your journal entry.<br>3. At the end of every month you will receive a professionally designed PDF (ready to print) with your journal entries<br><br>Do you think this is a service you'd be interested in?</div>

<div class="content">I am generally not interested in stuff that stores my data somewhere, anywhere in the 'net. This is a privacy issue.<br><br>I am generally not interested in Electron based local apps either. This is a user experience (UX) issue.<br><br>I am a regular buyer of software. Platform specific, well-designed desktop apps that work even if I happen to be "offline."</div>

<div class="content">Enrique:<br><br>There's quite a number of journalling websites and apps available already. What are the reasons one might want to use yours rather any of the existing ones?</div>
