<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I have just been reviewing things with regards to Current Initiative and I know you state that you can only have one. But do you think it’s OK to have a separate current Initiative for different areas, such as Home and Work? Or do you think keeping it at one regardless of context is better as whole?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">Dear Steve, thanks for your query. I suggest you experiment and find what works best for you. It rather depends on how separate your work and home life are - it's much easier to have two current initiatives if you are not working at home.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps you could have a morning and afternoon Current Initiative?<br><br>Gill</div>

<div class="content">Don't forget that the whole point of a Current Initiative is the principle "one thing at a time". If you have more than one during your working day you are letting go of that principle.</div>

<div class="content">Must one only work on the current initiative first in the morning? Perhaps in the morning and then later in the evening?</div>

<div class="content">Dear Jeremiah<br><br>First of all, there's no "must" about any of this - it's not holy writ that we are dealing with here!<br><br>The point about working on the current initiative first before starting anything else is so that it gets done. Otherwise the events of the day tend to prevent one ever getting started on it.<br><br>If you find it works well for you to work on your current initiative twice in a day that's fine. Stick with it. But if you find that you start missing days, then have another look at it.<br><br>Mark</div>
