<div class="content">I just read an article about Precrastination.  It seemed to relate to the little and often approach.  Basically the study concluded that we are likely to get any task or sub-task done or started quickly just to push it out of working memory faster.  While the article implies that it can have a negative outcome by making things harder in the long run, it fails to give credit for getting anything done at all.<br><a href="http://www.govexec.com/excellence/promising-practices/2014/09/precrastination-worse-procrastination/95036/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.govexec.com/excellence/promising-practices/2014/09/precrastination-worse-procrastination/95036/</a></div>

<div class="content">Oliver Burkeman wrote about this in his column: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/05/this-column-will-change-your-life-precrastination" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/05/this-column-will-change-your-life-precrastination</a><br><br>Burkeman's punchline: "The best solution I've discovered is to stick to a simple rule: don't clear the decks first, clear them second. If your job permits it, schedule a daily deck-clearing hour â€“ but at 4.30pm, not 9am. Switch your weekends around so that chores get done last (but assign a specific time, otherwise they won't get done at all). And whenever you catch yourself thinking, "Let me just get these little things out of the way first", consider the possibility that you'd be better off not bothering. Some don't need doing at all, while others can wait. "<br><br>Burkeman's solution depends on you being mindful in the moment, which may be problematic if you're tired, hungry, distracted, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Mike - I've been following something like that for the last several months and it's been great.   The little stuff, required maintenance, inbox clearing, etc. still gets done, but I get a lot more of the important focus work done.   I also find that 90+% of the little stuff that seems so important in the moment is already stale by the time I get around to dealing with it at the end of the day - which means it never really needed my attention anyway.</div>
