<div class="content">I think everyone's experience of how "Dreams" works is going to be unique, but here are a couple of things which have been true in my experience of it:<br><br>1) Dreams seems to start off by colonizing various areas of my life one by one, rather than everything all at once. So first it may get control of the email, then of the paper, then of the filing system, then of the fitness training, etc. etc. So it's quite normal to progress initially on a few subjects and for nothing to happen on others for some time.<br><br>2) Don't be dismayed if you wake up one morning and realize that your Future Reality is completely off the mark and that you need to tear it up and start again. Again this is quite normal and in fact represents a major break-through.</div>

<div class="content">Some quotes from fritz's book:<br><br>Structural tension exists when we see the discrepancy between what we want to create versus our current situation now. This discrepancy creates an energy that you can use to your benefit when you seek resolution to go toward what it is you want in your life. As the tension strives for resolution (much like a stretched rubber band) you as a creator can use that to propel you forward. "Once you establish structural tension, your natural tendency will be to generate actions in order to resolve the tension". "All of the actions you take to create your vision will help you move toward the result you want, including the ones that are not directly successful." (quotes from page 118)<br><br>Creating<br><br>"...the belief that your circumstances are the driving force in your life, therefore you will either react or respond to it. Unless you can operate in the creative process, you will continue to go back and forth in the reactive-responsive mode and never fully experience what you truly want in your life."<br><br>Probelm solving<br><br>"Problem solving involves actions that has something go away (the problem)."<br><br>"Once a tension exists, the path of least resistance leads toward resolution." (quote from page 77)<br><br>page 90, "If you try to change your behavior without first changing the underlying structure causing that behavior, you will not succeed. This is because structure determines behavior, not the other way around."<br><br>from <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/whatuwant" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/whatuwant</a></div>

<div class="content">Some things I've noticed while going through the exercises over the past week or so:<br><br>1) I've had great success killing some lingering bad habits by putting them as a line item on the "what's better" list.<br><br>2) It has taken several days for some aspects of my goals to suddenly "click into focus". When this happens, they become much clearer, but sometimes aren't even related to what I had originally written down! It's not incremental, it's very sudden.<br><br>3) Some longer term goals that have been frustrating me off and on for weeks suddenly seem much calmer.<br><br>I've also noticed a lot more elasticity in my thinking -- before I'd think to myself "to solve that problem, I just have to try harder!" without taking a new approach. Now I notice I tend to try different approaches with much greater success.<br><br>I'm still using SuperFocus for time management, with no apparent contention, so we'll continue to see how that goes.<br><br>The what's better list and some of the dialogging techniques remind me of the work of Michele Weiner-Davis. I'd highly recommend her books as well.</div>

<div class="content">An interesting thing has happened in the development of my Future Reality. I felt that I no longer wanted any specific goals in it, but that it should concentrate entirely on the "how" of living my life. So I dropped the bits about health and friendship and was left with this:<br><br>"I am living a creative life in which the principles of "Dreams" are fully put into practice. Everything I set my hands to comes to fruition effortlessly. My life is so well-ordered that I am free to do what I want to do and create what I want to create. I feel boundlessly optimistic in a life that is spacious and full of growth and discovery."<br><br>This is a good example of how the Future Reality will change as one keeps working on it. And obviously for different people it will change in different ways. Maybe once I've got the principles re-established in my life, the Future Reality will swing back to being more concrete - maybe not. But what is interesting me at the moment is the way it is gradually becoming more and more focused. This process is happening at its own pace. I'm not trying to force it.</div>

I have an article to write for my local parish magazine - deadline today. So far I've done nothing but jot down a few notes. I've remained faithful to the Dreams motto: "I'll do it when I feel like doing it and not before".  And so far I haven't felt like doing it. <br><br>I'm going to continue to trust the Dreams process and I'm not going to force myself to do it. What will happen?

<div class="content">A related approach to Present Reality might be the Creative Visualisation work of Shakti Gawain, and others - a common "new age" method for directing energy. I suppose the Future Vision replaces the visualised circumstance. both seem to act as a kind of jelly-mould for energy to fllow into.</div>

<div class="content">Oh, yes. Shakti Gawain. I think I did read a book of hers about intuition around about the time I was thinking of writing Dreams. But I didn't actually find what she wrote much use. I think I found it too much like wishful thinking and not fact based enough. But it's over ten years ago now, so I could be wrong.<br><br>She's very much a New Age figure I think, while I successfully or unsuccessfully have tried to put what's coming from the neuroscientists and others into a format which can be used by the average person.<br><br>Mind you, she's made a lot more money at it than I have, so who am I to criticize?</div>

<div class="content">avrum: visualisation in some form or other is the essence of all these approaches, written or not. There is a long tradition : "where there is no vision the people perish" as mentioned in the Bible. And for good reason. Imagination is the faculty by which we open doors to new possibilities. It is pretty fundamental in my opinion.</div>

<div class="content">One advantage of Mark's approach is it seems most effective at lowering resistance such as doubt, fear, or a clash with self-image or unconscious beliefs. Thse are often claimed to be causes of failure to manifest dreams in "new age" versions.</div>

<div class="content">Just started a week ago, with Dreams. Slow start but its picking up by itself now.<br><br>I have a tactical question and an incredible example that I just can not explain, but inspired me to write it for others.<br><br>first, the example...<br><br> I've had a wild and unbelievable experience that I had to look through and rethink a few times to realize that it was in fact a purely subconscious result.  <br>Here's what happened:<br><br>I had gone through the first exercises and created a full page "I would like list". Put it away for few days, and was mostly forgotten by then.<br><br>Well, what happened after the I would like list was put away for about 3 days, and I was getting started with the next step of beginning a "what's better" list is where something not consciously driven had already occurred. I just didn't realize it yet.<br><br>As i was working on the what's better list for the first time,<br>My 3rd item down on the list was this:<br><br>-Office in garage was suggested by wife, and can start thinking about what to do with<br><br>Now at this point in time, I had no recollection of anything on the I would like list, so I just kept going with the what better list.<br><br>As I was finishing up what I could come up with for my first What's better? list, I looked at the directions in the book of what to do next, and it was the - pick something from the list that stands out as a goal, and further down, was the advice to practice on something that could be done in a day.<br><br>So... I started reading through my full page list of would likes, and couldn't find anything that stuck out and could be done in a day, so went through again. This time I went through I found this item about 2/3 down the page:<br><br>The item was, as written:<br><br>to have the best working environment possible  for now (1 month) - ?sound proof room in garage?<br><br>I was thinking, wait a minute.... I quickly reread what I wrote on my what's better list that I had completely breezed over:<br>-Office in garage was suggested by wife, and can start thinking about what to do with<br><br>I Couldn't believe it! <br><br>When I went back and looked through the list, and went through the prior days events in detail, I realized that in fact, I took no conscious activity to have this become.  There was only communication (with my wife) of other not directly related issues, and somehow she came up with the idea that got this would like started.  We had discussed a room in the garage months ago, which she wasn't enthusiastic about it, but for a completely different reason.  Funny thing, is she is practically never the one who solves problems (that's me), but this time was different in that she had come back at the end of the day we were talking about other problems and in a way that is out of character for her she said this - "I have a solution to your environment problem - I think you should build an office in the garage. Do whatever you need to do to make it happen and I'll support it"<br><br>The background behind this item is I added this item (I think) because I have enormous challenges with distractions in home office with 3 young kids and chaos abound, so this is where this came from. Now the "for now (1 month)" part was that I had bigger longer term "I would like" solutions in this area on my list, but felt I wanted to have something more immediate.<br><br>So I'm stumped for logic connect the dots reasoning on this except that the subconscious and pull method works and does so in ways that you can not directly explain.<br><br>Wild stuff.<br><br>Now my tactical question:<br><br>I'm not using SF or any other system right now, but need some guidance on a simple approach/tool that I can use along with Dreams as to record ideas/to dos/reminders somewhere.  Should I just use my electronic What's better list (single word doc) and free flow list items on there? <br><br>A bad 'stuck' cycle occurs (sometimes weeks long) for me when not having 'a way or place' to record things that is reliable for capturing and that I will feel is useful. I then hesitate writing stuff down at all that I know are important to, which leads to the cycle continuing. So I feel pulled to asking and finding a solution to this piece as it seems important to me now as I proceed.</div>

<div class="content">I too have been messing around with Dreams after coming across it about a week ago. I am having a lot of success and excitement with this process. I think a lot of it is that it just fits with the way my brain works, the way I am wired for starters. I have ADD, am an artist (literary writer) (well published) and although I have done most everything for planning and plotting my time and days and goals, and the best system until now is a day list of stuff I want to get done. DIT like. Although believe me I have tried everything in between including autofocus, gtd, etc.<br><br>So then this Dreams thing comes across the transom. I gobble it up in one sitting. I start in five minutes. I am a big journaler anyway so this is like falling off a log for me.<br><br>I write (daily) my desired future, my present reality. I write pages of I WANTS and pages of I DON'T WANTS. Then I even go into I SHOULDS because those are MY I shoulds and they just came out of nowhere. But they are mine so I go with it. I do the BETTER lists at night.<br><br>BWAMMO!!!! I just start in on my life. No structure. No lists. In fact one of the strongest things about this Dreams thing is the FREEDOM. I started getting so much done. Working and working. Stuff that had been sitting around for months and years. There was no wrong move because I kept telling myself I was FREE and could do whatever I was moved to do. I would get stuck and remember to tell myself I could do anything so don't worry about it. That helped so much.<br><br>The thing that really sticks out for me from what Mark says in that book is that everything we do comes from feelings. Now feelings is my strong suit. I have spent so much time either trying to pound my feelings into shape so I could go to work, micro-managing my time so I could get something done (but as I set up huge schedules and structure and lists the feelings soon depart and I am stuck slogging along like a dead person.) I go numb fast in other words. Numb to lists, to structure.<br><br>Turning it over a la AA and the Higher Power thing Mark speaks about sends me off drifting as well. I go numb. I wait. I am always somehow waiting for the right system, the right way to do things-- The right way is through connection to your feelings actually. Right now I am not fighting with my feelings--I am trusting them.<br><br>Anyway this has been going on for a few days now. On the more difficult front is my writing. I am writing a book and it is a long hard slog. I have not worked through the Dreams thing with my book yet. My morning insight is that there is now with the book I am writing and there is the future desired reality with the book I am writing and with myself as a writer--and that there is ground to traverse to get from one to the other. That is what I am being lead to see (by the intuition inside me) right now, and that I should keep going and hang out with the trip. We know where we are going, so all is good etc. But I am def not going to knock off this book like I knocked off about a hundred other cool things over the weekend.<br><br>More later, but I wanted to get this out there.<br><br>Trish</div>

<div class="content">Trish:<br>i enjoyed your writing. Some thoughts that may support you from new-age thinking.<br>trusting feelings is trusting energy-in-motion (e-motion), flowing from a higher power (?!). I'm keen on freedom too and it often comes from choosing our response, not focusing on the outer.</div>

<div class="content"><<I know you will find this difficult to believe but I do occasionally get some things done without having to broadcast my intention to my countless readers.>><br><br>Ouch! Point taken.<br><br>One of the fundamental behavioral techniques to get things done is to make a commitment to others, e.g. announcing you will start an exercise program, or stop smoking. <br><br>When someone does this as an intentional strategy to increase their odds of success, I would classify that as a push strategy. (Am I correct?) But in my overly concise post, I now realize that I could have been interpreted as implying that Mark wouldn't have gotten his article completed unless he posted his public commitment here. That was not my intent. Sorry.</div>

<div class="content">An interesting Robert Fritz take on affirmations, one of the major tools of personal development and self-growth<br><br>"The ideal/belief/reality conflict begins with an unwanted belief someone has, such as, “I’m a loser.” This belief is so unacceptable that the person automatically generates an ideal. The ideal is the opposite of the belief. “I’m a winner.” The purpose of the ideal is to argue against the real belief and hide it from view. There are only two ways to try to live up to the ideal, evidence and affirmation. Evidence is the list of real world accomplishments that argue against the ideal; “How can you be a loser if you keep winning all these awards?” Even as the list gets longer, the structure points back to the unwanted belief, “Who but a person who thinks she is a loser must prove she isn’t?”<br><br>The other strategy is to affirm the ideal: “I am a winner, I am a winner, etc.” So, over time, the unwanted belief is reinforced by the affirmation because the only reason to declare the ideal is to argue against the belief."<br><br>and a rebuff to self-esteem?<br><br>"As I have said before, hasn’t the self-esteem gang ever read a biography of the most accomplished people? If they had, they would be forced to reject their own doctrine. And so, Lady Gaga, with her unwanted belief in tact, went on stage to a sold out crowd and blew their socks off, because, at the end of the day, what you think about yourself doesn’t matter a bit in the creative process.  Not one bit."<br><br><a href="http://on.fb.me/mC5IY0" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://on.fb.me/mC5IY0</a></div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br>I have always found affirmations to be completely useless. The trouble I find is that I can't fool my mind simply by saying "I'm a winner" over and over. There's always a little voice in my head saying "No, you're not". And the trouble is that it's this little voice which I actually believe.<br><br>What I've sometimes done is use this in reverse. So I would tell myself "This seminar is going to be a disaster" and the little voice would say "No, it's not".

<div class="content">Having posted the above about affirmations, I'm finding that my Future Reality is becoming more and more like an affirmation:<br><br>"I am living a creative life in which I do what I feel like doing. Everything I set my hands to comes to fruition effortlessly, and I feel at peace with myself and the universe."<br><br>It's interesting to explore why this is a different dynamic from an affirmation. There are two main reasons, I think:<br><br>1) I have allowed the Future Reality to develop rather than be something static which I'm trying to persuade myself is true. So it ends up reflecting a truth about myself, even if that truth isn't being manifested at present.<br><br>2) The Future Reality is balanced by the Current Reality, in which I'm completely honest about where I am in relation to the Future Reality. This is where the "little voice" gets its say.<br><br>Working with the two Realities in this way means that you believe both of them, and this creates the structural tension between them which Fritz says propels one towards the goal.<br><br>The problem I had with Fritz's book was that I didn't think that he paid enough attention to feelings and the development of the Future Reality (my term - I can't remember what he calls it). In fact, if I remember rightly, he's rather dismissive about feelings and he advises describing the goal only enough so you'll recognise it when you see it. It's a long time since I read his book, but I remember thinking that his basic thesis, creating structural tension between the future and the present, was spot on but that he hadn't actually taken it far enough.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br><<perhaps that means you are rapidly clarifying and refining your vision >><br><br>My first attempt at a future vision included a lot of detail i.e. I'm living in Vancouver, BC, on such and such a street. I'm wondering if that hinders the process - particularly if each daily revision includes new details based on how I'm feeling that day. I'm not sure. Also, I'm toying with the idea of including a sub-goal i.e. The launch of a successful graphic novel, to be used for my daily exercises.</div>

What feeling, specifically? And what other ways are there of having that feeling? If you insist on specifics I believe you limit the forms and circumstances that can deliver it.</div>

<div class="content">...another "better". My feel for the process and trust in it and the essence of what I want seemed to arrive and settle all at once. I have emphasised some aspects of Mark's work for my own benefit:<br><br>1. essence of what I hope to gain is more important than often mentioned. There is often some small examples of the feeling or state of being or thing around already. It needs a litlle noticing to bring it to foreground though. Fo r example, my favourite holiday locations evoke a certain state, but there are local beauty spots that can evoke similar moods and states. I like to remind myself of that to make more available to my daily experience.<br><br>2. clarifying what I want by writing a letter to my future self or spiritual self is important to me; reading it out as a request makes it more real for me<br><br>3.  as well as the dialogue with future me I imagine the habits and qualities of being my future me has developed; I draw those energies to me magnetically.

<div class="content"><<The trick is to find a target that simultaneously accommodates many things.>><br><br>Yes. I call them "super-effective" targets and give them high priority. If you smoke, quiting is an example of a super-effective target for most people, as it affects possitively the basic conditions: health, use of time, use of money and nowadays social acceptability as well. Another example, which I have adopted since many years ago: in town, travel only by bicycle. You get daily exercise, save lots of money, save time (true for distances up to a few kilometers, depending also on the parking conditions at your destination) and don't contaminate your evironment. Other examples would be more person-related.</div>

Then you're unhappy because you miss your family too much.<br><br>If you had thought about how to satisfy both good family life and good climbing experience, you might have chosen instead to move one hundred kilometers towards a local climbing spot, join a club, and make the occasional big trip.  That is a change consistent with your other goals, but not necessarily a "super-effective" target.</div>

<div class="content">"The "present reality-future reality" may work for a specific movement (project),.. Nor for your life as a whole."<br><br>I'm actually finding it works for my life as a whole. On a day to day basis, I find there is a clear focus on one major aspect of the vision at a time. For me, it's my scholarship. As an untenured scholar I need to publish, publish, publish. The major pull is happening in that area.<br><br>But a surprising amount of pull is also happening from other parts of my future vision. Yesterday I did not want to work after an intense writing stint in the morning. So I was dialoguing a lot to avoid getting into Drift mode of Push mode. I decided to reread my future reality.<br><br>What jumped out at me was a sentence about having lots of "cozy spaces inside and outside the home to live and work in". I had a visceral response to that phrase. I suddenly knew what I wanted to do! Our major public library has lovely work stations on a broad staircase against a huge glass wall, with natural light pouring in (and wifi). I've never tried them and I'm trying to create a list of "cozy spaces" for when winter comes, so I'm not trapped at home. And I also had wanted to go to the library for personal fun (but had been telling myself, via push mode, that I didn't deserve to go until I wrote more!).<br><br>So I went to the library, had fun getting books for my reading pleasure. I felt really drawn to the setting of the work stations, so I set up my netbook at one and had an unbelievably productive 90 minutes of writing! And I've moved closer to a different part of my vision which is about having numerous "cozy spaces".<br><br>I often find synergy between the various parts of my future vision. That was only one example. It's really remarkable how that works.<br><br>Silvia</div>

But that's kind of amorphous. It's not like building a beautiful table, for example.

At first, it felt like an add-on to my work, just like my students see writing their terms papers as some dumb requirement they have to do to prove they know their stuff.

Publishing extends the impact and reach and durability of my work. It gives me a wider audience, a wider peer group with which to engage.<br><br>It sounds like you love to teach and that's a noble and sacred calling.

He asks:<br><br>"The important question is: Does increased cycling weaken the level of public transport service?"<br><br>Both public transport and cycling are sustainable means of locomotion: they both reduce pollution, congestion, noise and are more economic efficient.<br><br>The most efficient strategy is to combine them. Go with your bike to the tramway (do you use this word?), get your bike in it, get down in the closest station to your destination, bike from the station to the door you want. Door to door transportation.<br><br>In practice, when applying for budgets from the public authority for their projects, there may arouse a rivalry between advocates of public transport and those of cycling. Those of public transport are usually stronger, as public transport is more popular than cycling, and there are strong economic interests involved.<br><br>As for the second link, the topic of sustainable urban planning is gradually overtaking older approaches. One of its core concepts is that the street is not only for cars, but for all the people that share it: pedestrians, cyclists, and if you are willing to include some vegan views, animals too. That concept translates into urban planning and is generating new ideas that gradually are being implemented. True, bad planned cycling path may lead to accidents as well as bad planned streets lead to car accidents.<br><br>Do you really think that in a town where everybody would travel by bicycle there would be more fatal accidents than in a town where everybody travels by car?

I've had far more near misses as a pedestrian from people on cycles than I ever have from cars. A cycle is a pretty lethal instrument when going fast, is less stable than a car, less able to stop quickly, gives less notice of its approach and tends to be driven less responsibly. Also cyclists have none of the safely features that cars have of progressively collapsible bulkheads, air bags, seat belts, reinforced roofs etc.  Given a collision between two cyclists at 20 mph and two cars at 20 mph, do you really think the car drivers would come off worst?<br><br>If cyclists were removed from city roads, you would immediately have taken the most vulnerable section of road users out of the equation, so I would expect the number of fatal accidents to drop markedly.</div>

That is, based on the risks in 2009 you have less than .5% risk of dying in an RTA.  <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/dth1010.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/dth1010.pdf</a> <br><br><<As a pedestrian I'm not so sure of that - see my previous post.

I would further concede that the current perception of the risks might select cyclists towards the idiot end of the spectrum as well. Nevertheless, I maintain that the numbers of actual fatalities are small. <br><br><< Go by public transport then and walk. That's what I do.>><br><br>Sound advice. Though, interestingly, walking is 50% more dangerous than cycling... <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=5178&Pos=3&ColRank=2&Rank=224" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=5178&Pos=3&ColRank=2&Rank=224</a><br><br>Interesting, eh?

<div class="content">Will:<br><br>Now that last one is interesting. I hadn't realised that walking was so dangerous. Public transport is definitely the best bet, once one's survived the perils of getting to and from it anyway!<br><br>Still, in the original comment which started this discussion I appear to have underestimated the degree of risk associated with cycling.<br><br>Although I seem to have been wrong about RTAs being the major cause of death in under-60s, nevertheless I don't think they are as negligible as you make out either. According to <a href="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Risk/trasnsportpop.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Risk/trasnsportpop.html</a> :<br><br>"The lifetime risk of dying in a transport accident is remarkably high - with most of the risk coming from road traffic accidents. While the risk of dying in a road accident in any year in the UK approaches 1 in 20,000, the lifetime risk is 1 in 240. In the Ukraine it is 1 in 80."<br><br>Хай живе Україна!</div>

<div class="content">1/240 is pretty close to 0.4%: I don't see this as high, compared to the risk of heart disease which has doubled in a generation. If Marcelo is right about the effect on fitness, I would think that cycling would increase your expected lifespan.<br><br>Not sure that the words "Live", "Long" and "Ukraine" sit comfortably in a discussion of cycling?</div>

<div class="content"><< Go by public transport then and walk. That's what I do.>><br><br>People normally would be willing to walk up to 500 meters. For longer distances they will choose some means of transport. A bicycle doubles that distance.<br><br><<If Marcelo is right about the effect on fitness>><br><br>Cycling definitely improves fitness - any prolonged exercise that involves mainly the legs, which because of their size require a big supply of blood, will improve your cardiovascular condition. <br><br>If I were to ride in the center of London or some other very polluted city ( <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jun/25/london-air-pollution-europe" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jun/25/london-air-pollution-europe</a> ), I would wear a mask to filter the air.</div>

<div class="content">So, should I start a thread on "How to choose the right bicycle for you" or would you prefer to play with the idea a little longer?</div>
