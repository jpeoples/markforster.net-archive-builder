<div class="content">NB this is with the writing help of AI: -<br><br>Most systems work—at least, in theory. They’re designed to organize, remind, nudge, and structure. But let’s be honest: we don't fail because the system is broken. We fail because deep down, we’re resisting certain tasks.<br>How many times have you tried a shiny new productivity method, felt inspired, then watched it collapse under the same old procrastination? You’re not alone. The real challenge isn’t finding the perfect system—it’s tackling the internal resistance that keeps you cycling from one system to the next.<br>So, here’s my proposal: For the entire month of August, complete every “doable” task the moment you encounter it—either when you first see it, or when your system tells you it’s time.<br>Yes, it’s bold. Yes, it will be tough. But if you stick to this for a month, you’ll likely clear a mountain of lingering tasks, feel more in control, and build serious momentum.<br>Here’s a tip if you’re stalling: do just a little of the task. More often than not, the act of starting leads to finishing.<br>If you’re in, post your progress. Share your wins and roadblocks. Let’s make August the month things actually get done.<br>My own system is simple but effective:<br>•	A reliable reminder/scheduling tool that cues tasks at the right time<br>•	Urgent items are flagged and done immediately<br>•	Then I work through tasks from oldest to newest—it’s the truest measure of how current I am<br>If a backlog builds, the solution is simple: either free up more time, or make fewer commitments.</div>

<div class="content">I admire your ability to work on new "doable" tasks as soon as you get them while also  working on oldest Projects first to close them out.     I tend to focus more on the newer projects because of the novelty and perhaps shiny object syndrome.   So my question is how do you define "doable" for the new stuff?  Is there a time element there?</div>

<div class="content">The coach Steve Chandler wrote a book 10+ years ago, "Time Warrior", which is basically "do it now" or put it on a calendar, and do one thing at a time. More elaborated of course, but doing things as they arise is the method, as I recall.<br><br>My laziness manifests itself with a Mark Forster "do it tomorrow" attitude. There was a problem in our organization that I did not leap to fix right away; too many little steps, I'll do the next step tomorrow. By then, someone else jumped in, corrected the source of the problem (more elegantly than I could have done it), and I crossed it off my list.<br><br>Long way of saying: yes, i agree with taking care of things NOW most of the time, **but**...</div>
