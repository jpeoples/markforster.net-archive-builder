<div class="content">SF admits 5 speeds of operation for tasks. <br>Now(1min) - just do it.<br>Urgent(1h)- enter C2, do it before turning page<br>Soon (1d) - enter last page, do when you arrive<br>Near Future (1w)- enter last page, do sometime before page is dismissed<br>Medium Future. (1mo) - enter last page, let it be dismissed, resurrect upon a future review<br>parked (Never) - enter whereever, delete any time. <br><br>Also for recurring tasks and big tasks, you can work them at any of the above frequencies, with the C2 option allowing a task to be picked up hourly for a while then set aside for a day or so.</div>

<div class="content">This analysis stands in marked contrast to Mark's tips. This analysis eliminates the "unfinished" criterion and uses only the "urgent" criterion. <br><br>I am sympathetic to this presentation of the system.<br><br>From my short experience, and from reading Mark's commentary, "unfinished" does not appear to be the most appropriate description of what makes something C2-worthy. To use a transportation analogy, C2 is for items that I want to remove from the local track and put on the express track. <br><br>My only quibble with your 5 speeds is over "now." There are many good reasons to write things down. Maybe the cutoff should be a lot shorter than 1 minute. Fifteen seconds?</div>

<div class="content">It's a given that unfinished work will be resumed every time you turn the page. As I wrote above, that's about hourly.  "Express track" is an apt phrase.  The time scales are all mnemonic, and approximate.  So 15 seconds is a fair substitute for 1 minute.<br><br>One notable point of the above is that SF is not a good place for things you want to do summertime, unless you're in the mode of planning your summer activities.  I deem the dismissed pages ought to be cleared out by the time they get a month old.  So where do these go?  Perhaps it's not a problem.</div>
