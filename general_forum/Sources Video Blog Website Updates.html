<div class="content">Hello everyone!<br><br>I'd like to thank Mark for this little bit of real estate on his site. May his generosity be an inspiration to us all.<br><br>I'll create a first post with all the info to the basic questions I often get and then post updates from the videos when they arrive. Please feel free to comment or ask questions!<br><br>The Basic Website can be found here: <a href="http://www.erikorrain.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.erikorrain.com/</a><br>It's called Sources.<br>I can be reached at: webmaster@eriklorrain.com<br>You can follow my updates on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/iSources" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.com/iSources</a><br>The Videos are all in a Blog that is here: <a href="http://www.eriklorrain.com/Sources/iVideoBlog/iVideoBlog.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.eriklorrain.com/Sources/iVideoBlog/iVideoBlog.html</a><br>It has an RSS feed for those who like updates that way.<br><br>The basic format is "Google Waves" so Internet Explorer will not see the videos.<br>If you are in that situation and don't want to try another browser,<br>all the videos are hosted on Vimeo here: <a href="http://vimeo.com/user4254877/videos" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://vimeo.com/user4254877/videos</a><br>But we would not be able to benefit from your comments and contribution.<br><br>If you want to participate to the discussions, you have 2 options.<br>Subscribe to Google Wave and the Group (the way to do that is shown in the video on the Main Page).<br>Or leave comments on the video pages themselves (anybody can do that easily like here). But since it is not like here (a forum), you will have to go back to that particular page to see if there are comments.</div>
