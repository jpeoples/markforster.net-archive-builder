<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I am sure this has been discussed at length, but I can't find a thread for it...on Chrome, this website has been scrambled a bit. I would open the site, see it was blank and figured it would be fixed eventually.  Then I realized all the posts were in the right hand sidebar, and everything has shifted to far right.  <br><br>Has the website moved to a new location and this is just a legacy version showing, or is it this way for everyone?  Is there a fix?<br><br>Dave</div>

<div class="content">It's that way for everyone. See this thread for discussion and a couple of temporary fixes:<br><br><a href="../general_forum/Bookmarklet to fix this site's layout.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2791667</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Just an fyi that I went to the menu item on your site "TM Systems" and then clicked on the "Autofocus 1 (AF1)"  hyperlink (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/)</a>  and saw the following error message:<br><br>Domain Not Claimed<br>This domain has been mapped to Squarespace, but it has not yet been claimed by a website. If this is your domain, claim it in the Domains tab of your Website Manager.<br><br>The same error message appears for some of the other links from that page.</div>

<div class="content">Paul B: As a very temporary solution,  It looks like if you change www.markforster.net to markforster.squarespace.com in the link you can get to the correct spot.</div>
