<div class="content">The most productive person I know calls his method "4T"--Top Three Things Today. Here's a summarization. I'd be curious how it strikes anyone:<br><br><br>Top three things today.<br>These are about progress not maintenance<br>It's an end of the day litmus test--did i get to where I wanted to today?<br><br>That's 21 game changing activities a week<br><br>RULES<br>-Tie them to speed of implemntionat<br>-break bigger challenges down to parts<br>-not optional--play hard and win<br>-apply it to anything you have resisted<br><br>This silly little trick will change your life</div>

<div class="content">I've actually been using the website tasksmash.com to do 3-4 things each day that I determine at the beginning of the day.  These I definitely do every day.  (You don't actually have to use the website to do that, of course, however the website automatically keeps track of how many days in a row I have met my goals, and lets me connect up with a few friends to keep each other accountable. Psychologically, it does the trick to motivate me.)<br><br>I also have a list of tasks that I try to do every day in order to make steady progress on certain goals.  There is a little bit of overlap between these two lists sometimes.</div>

<div class="content">It strikes me that this is a set of principles or ideas - not really a "method" or a set of "rules".<br><br>In my mind, for something to be called a "rule", it must be a specific, actionable, unambiguous direction on how to take an action or make a decision.   "Break bigger challenges down to parts" is a good idea, but it is too ambiguous (what does "bigger" mean?   what kind of "parts"? etc.) and not specific enough to be a "rule".   It's like the "little and often" principle - it's an extremely powerful principle but the exact implementation is left open to interpretation.<br><br>And with all principles and ideas - the real test of success is in the implementation.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim: yes, the "rules" here struck me as pretty vague, which is what prompted me to bring it up here. <br><br>As I said, this guy is amazingly organized and productive, so clearly his implementation is adequate.<br><br>Makes me wonder if there's a type of person who's more inclined to "just get things done" and honestly doesn't need more shape or guidance than the above.</div>

<div class="content">I would guess that, even if he did accurately summarize his main principles, there is a lot about his actual day-to-day implementation that he did not articulate.<br><br>Perhaps he is not even aware of the actual specific things he is doing, and thus is not able to articulate them.  Sometimes successful people aren't really totally aware of the things they are doing that drive their success.  Sometimes they just do those things automatically or unconsciously, out of long habit.</div>

<div class="content">Hmm... In the past I've tried the "Top x things today" method with x being any number between 1 and 6, and I have to say it didn't work for me whatever number I picked!</div>
