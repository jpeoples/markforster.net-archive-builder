<div class="content">I tried something I never really did before. Reading my FVP list I realized that most of the items belongs to projects in a GTD way. So I decided today to make it simple and try AGAIN the digital way as I have Omnifocus everywhere and on all my devices. <br><br>So, my Project are organized on actionable and non actionable ie Waiting for<br>My Contexts are : "Now list", "SMB (someday may be)", "WF (waiting for)"<br>Inbox is used for capturing using a short cut (ALT +N) tasks as they come, if they are'nt relative to a project... If they do they goes into the project.<br><br>FOR WORKING the idea was to put nothing in my paper notebook but notes. <br><br>So, I just took my projects one by one and jot ideas, as they came, then put at the end on my now list what I intend to do asap. I also put a end date on what must be done or if they were incoming at a certain date. I also put on WF what I wait from others or was delagated. <br><br>Result : At the end of the day I did all about I wanted on 4 projects I was reluctant ! <br><br>One was the taxes (end date tomorrow)- I was bloqued on that one since a month. <br>One was a personnal project, 2 were commercial projects I must close on wednesday. <br><br>The day was not worst than another. It is 18:00 Pm and I have done what I wanted. All my active projects are in order. I will capture new tasks later. Everything is under control.<br><br>You will say this is not MF system. Right !  except that for doing things I used the stand out system letting my intuition choosing what I wanted to do just now. Without planning anything. Just be mentaly beeing present and focus on the now instant. <br><br>Tonight I feel quiet. I have the felling that I done my best.</div>

<div class="content">thanks Jupiter, did you use the list you had previously and just change the contexts? Mark suggests starting small and building. I was thinking of starting with the new context "Now list" and leave the rest of the data in Omni focus, for an archive.</div>

<div class="content">@Erin<br><br>I use two parallele system. My items are on OF and on a paper notebook a molekine. So I simply changed the contexts and keps in the "now list" the one I really want acting on. The trouble is that for me, it is un pleasant to use on a daily basis<br><br>On one hand I like OF I have it on all my device (GTD user)<br>On another hand using a sofware make me loose the sense of things. I like paper. It is as Mark said much faster, there is also a very special feeling about things which is nearly un explainable. <br>Whith paper I stay concentrate on doing. With paper I feel knowing what to do and when. Writting things helps me remembering what happened, what is happening and what will soon happen. <br><br>When I put my stuff in digital, which for me can be omnifocus or evernote, I loose this feeling sensation. I can find everything but I dont "feel" things. I loose my senses of controlling things, and loose a part of intuition <br><br>With paper I never missed a deadline, it works everytime, everywhere, I spend my ife doing thing instead of organizing thing like I do in OF <br><br>any way even if it is a bit more complicated, less hype, less of the 21 th century I take pleasure of doing things on paper but not on digital. <br><br>Many time I changed my system. Paper always saved me<br><br>I am may be a traditionale person but for my task I really prefer paper. I think I will keep computer for databases, and communication.</div>

<div class="content">I have been using a paper system for the last several months. Now I am doing a major paper purge so I was thinking of going back to digital. I just tried Taskmator, it's the iOS version of Taskpaper. Omnifocus always draws me in. Thanks for your thoughts about paper and digital.</div>
