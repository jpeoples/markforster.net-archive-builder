<div class="content">I'm just about finished reading DIT. Today I started with a Will-Do-List. However, I want to make sure I'm doing this correctly. Isn't the AF4 list an all-inclusive time management system? Or is the idea to keep a separate Will-Do-List that includes a task of working the AF list? Also, is the reference to Daily Tasks a separate entry on the AF list or Will-Do-List, that refers to several things to be done everyday, e.g., email, Twitter update, etc.? If this is the case, I could spend many hours on one task.</div>

<div class="content">AutoFocus was invented after DIT was written, and was not intended to have any connection to DIT.  AutoFocus does require a calendar or something to manage future tasks.<br><br>If you're following DIT, it doesn't use AutoFocus methods or lists.  The upcoming DIT2 is rumoured to blend these concepts but we haven't yet seen how.  So if you want to handle your "Will Do" list "correctly", set aside all the AutoFocus ideas and just use it on its own.  <br><br>If you're less concerned about "correct" you can invent your own blending of the two but there is no proven way to do this.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Alan. I really like using the AF lists. Using the Will-Do-List today I saw how much I'm adding to my normal plan for work: emails, phone calls, etc. And I'm doing way too much that has nothing to do with overall work goals. So, maybe, a combination of AF and DIT is in order. I'm hoping this is in the works as you mention.</div>
