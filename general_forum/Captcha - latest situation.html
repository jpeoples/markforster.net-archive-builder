<div class="content">As most of you know the Captcha for the Comments and Forums is inactive because Squarespace is not still maintaining this version. <br><br>As a few people have recently reported that they can't post at all as a result, I want to check on people's latest experiences with the Captcha (or lack of it). Only about half the people posting are signed in, so a lot must be getting through somehow.<br><br>If there's a serious problem (as opposed to a temporary glitch) I'll re-open registration for new members - who get a password which will bypass the captcha altogether. I'm reluctant to do this unnecessarily as it requires quite a bit of work on my part.<br><br>So those who have recently posted a comment without signing in, please let me know how it went - whether you posted successfully or not.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark, I post without signing in and it works successfully every time. I enter my name and my text and click 'Create Post'. Using Safari 13 on macOS 10.14.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark. I just posted without logging in via my Chrome browser on a windows desktop. This one should work too.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark, I've never had a problem posting comments, I just enter my name (and sometimes email) but I haven't registered with the site. <br>Best wishes</div>

<div class="content">Good morning from North America,<br>Like Liz, I too am a time reader who rarely posts. I suspect this post will go through, but we'll see.<br>Safari 12.1.1, MacOS 10.14 (updating soon.....).</div>

<div class="content">I only have problems with posting links. Links to other sites trigger the captcha, but you can butcher the url until it goes through. Links to your own sites, for example to old blog posts or forum threads, as they are now trigger the captcha as well, but I noticed that if you put the old markforster.net domain in instead of the squarespace one, you get no captcha.<br><br>As a side note, if there are people that get the captcha every time, they can't answer here. :)</div>
