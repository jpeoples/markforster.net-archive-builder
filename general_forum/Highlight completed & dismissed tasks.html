<div class="content">Hi<br><br>I prefer to highlight completed tasks rather than cross them out and also highlight dismissed tasks but in a different colour.<br><br>I don't know why I prefer to do this but it does seem to make the process of completing tasks more enjoyable. <br><br>Up until starting AF I have very rarely used highlighters, so it's not like I've a fetish for them (-: <br><br>I also find it makes uncompleted tasks easier to see and makes it easier to read completed tasks if, for example, I want to see how long ago I completed a specific task.<br><br>Does anyone else do this?<br><br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>Do you also record against each task when you completed it?  I thought the only date reference would the day on which you entered it into AF.<br><br>I had three highlight colours, now only use two, neither for completed tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I use ticks (rather than crossing out) on my paper but I do use highlight on my digital version instead. I think it does help items stand out on screen but would caution against too many colours or notations which can be distracting as Roger says. Personally I think just one pen plus the notepad is the simplest solution but then I find the use of tags distracting as well .............</div>

<div class="content">Roger - No I only enter the date refrerence as you describe but I'm pretty good at recalling how soon after I wrote the task I completed it.<br><br>Christine - I can see how ticks would work well. I didn't think of that one.<br><br>However I don't find picking up a biro to enter a task or a highlighter to dismiss/mark complete a task complicates things or slows me down.  After 5 years of using GTD with a Palm synching to a Computer,  it's a positive breeze!<br><br>How do you designate "dismissed items"?<br><br>Cheers<br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">I can see why that would be a breeze in comparison!  I don't use highlighters on paper as they tend to bleed through and I am using both sides of the paper but that is really just a practical reason.  On my digital AF in One Note I highlight completed items in yellow, and dismissed items will be highlighted in green.  On my paper lists I would use just the one highlighter for dismissed tasks, as by the time I get to dismissing tasks the issue of colour bleed won't be much of a problem.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using two Moleskine Notebooks (work & personal).  There isn't a problem with bleed as you would expect given the quality of paper which is reflected in the cost of them!<br><br>Cheers<br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">My whole list is written in black, and completed tasks are crossed out in black. When I say 'crossed out' I do a double row of zizags so they're REALLY crossed out. It's a fantastic feeling - "be gone, sucker". Way more satisfying than a simple line strikethrough.<br><br>When I cross out an ongoing task, I do so in red, so the original task remains legible. I also write in the margin how long I spent on that task on that occasion, so when I beat a previous 'best time' I can reward myself, as well as get a better idea of how I'm spending time on projects.<br><br>I have a biro which writes in both black and red so I just clip it to my notebook. Very convenient.<br><br>I haven't yet dismissed anything so the highlighters are redundant for now.</div>

<div class="content">I also highlight completed tasks in blue. It really helps to identify outstanding tasks on a nearly completed page.</div>

<div class="content">I cross out using a coloured pencil - this has a similar affect to crossing out with a highligher but doesn't bleed through.<br><br>... Colin</div>

<div class="content">I just put a checkmark next to it, and then strike it through with a line or two, and then write the completion date to the right.  I'm trying to do daily metrics, to see if my new tasks vs completed tasks is balancing out yet, and writing the date is helpful for this purpose.<br><br>I find striking it through completely makes it easier to stay focused on the tasks that still remain on the page -- easier to find them.  I also like this method because it's very simple.  If I was using some special color, then I'd always have to have that special colored pen handy, and I am just not that organized.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Although I am only a week into using AF, I had to comment on the issue of using highlighters, which I have done for years, and continuing to do so with AF.<br><br>For me, highlighting my completed tasks makes the incomplete REALLY stand out.  My eyes have learned to disregard the color and focus on the black and white.  I have begun using Pentel's Handy-LineS highlighters.  They are slim, retractable, refillable, and come in colors blue, yellow, orange, pink.  Most importantly, I have not had them bleed through the paper I use (Rollabind, Circa).  The part I really love about these, besides the no-bleed quality, is that they are small enough to fit into a pen holder on my planner, AND they are retractable - no fussy caps to deal with. (When I buy a new planner, I always take a razor blade and split the pen holder so that I have 2 slots which hold my pen and my highlighter)<br><br>Re: the refillable part - as with many big box stores, refills aren't listed on the website (we use Staples where I work) but if you call them, they do have the ability to get them.  The last time I bought refills, I believe they were less than $1 for 2.  The whole set is currently priced at $4.99 on the Staples website.<br><br>I just wanted to add something since I have existed in "lurkdom" for quite some time on this site and have picked up so many great tips from other regular posters here - wanted to give back :)  Maybe someone will find this useful.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">AF for each of us is and individual and evolving system/apporach which is why this Forum is such a valuable place to picking up others' methods, nuances etc.<br><br>After going from paper to electronic and now back to paper, I am currently settled on using a black gel pen on a large ( 5.25 x 8.25 inches) Moleskine ruled notebook (31 lines) with brown kraft cover (available in packs of three).<br><br>- items entered have a dash on the left<br>+ "target" item standing out<br>+ completed items crossed out and highlighted in GREEN<br>- cancelled items crossed out with wavey line, highlighted in GREEN<br>- items which I "Defer to Do Later" because they cannot be physically done in my present location (I work abroad most of the time) are highlighted in YELLOW so I can skip these until I am in a place where they can be done eg at an airport with a decent Internet connection.<br>-items Dismissed for Review are highlighted in PINK.<br><br>In practice I cross out completed items immediately, then highlight later if I don;t have the highlights with me.<br><br>QUESTION: I want to get a leather or similar cover for my AF Moleskine.  Yes, I know I can get them already bound with nice hard covers, but I like the slim 40 sheet model I'm using, just want to protect it in use.  I've only found a US site <a href="http://www.renaissance-art.com/catg109/category.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.renaissance-art.com/catg109/category.aspx</a> , but wondered if anything similar is available in the UK.</div>

<div class="content">Those sharp enough may have noticed that my latest post today "contradicts" my 22 January on this same thread!  I was using three colours, then two, now back to three.<br><br>Although I also cross out in black ink, my goal is to fill as many lines as possible in green, some in yellow, the rest in pink.  I have already noticed that my scanning is ignoring the highlighted items and look among the black ink items only for the next stand-out.<br><br>It's an example of how one tweaks AF to keep it going, and with far less hassle than with GTD, MLO etc ie with AF being individually oriented and with much lower overhead, one can "try it, fix it or ditch it", which is what I have done with going from paper to electronic and back to paper, although I still use Outlook for appointments, blocked items and reminders.  The reminders for "Defer to Do Later" (see previous post by me) are allocated to a context category where I know I will be able to process them, eg in an airport lounge with decent wi-fi.</div>

<div class="content">What I'm doing right now:<br>-> when I enter an item, I draw a box in the left "margin" (my next AF notebook will have actual margins!)  I have always loved drawing ticky-boxes, I don't know why.  ;^)<br>-> when I act on the item, I put a tick mark in the box, note the date at the end of the line, and re-enter it if it's not complete / a recurring item.<br>-> when I dismiss an item, it gets highlighted yellow.  the date that the page was dismissed is noted in the top margin.<br>-> when I review a dismissed item, the ticky-box gets an X and the date of the review gets noted at the end of the line.  when I review items, I either re-enter them on my list in some form or create a timed reminder, so this closes the page - the date of the page closing is also noted in the top margin.<br><br>The issue I'm having is that when I get down to the last couple of items on a page, it starts to get hard to find them, as many of the previous posters have noted.  I'm mulling over various methods of dealing with this but would love to hear ideas about ways to make them stand out that are not very pen-intensive (I am trying to stay as close to one notebook, one pen as possible).</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure what you mean by 'not pen intensive' but why not just completely cross off  the item with the same pen? I cross off items completely - not a single line, but totally covering all the words. The rows of neat crossed off items makes the remaining items very noticeable. I don't highlight finished items because if I can still read it, then I'm still reading & deciding about it everytime I go over the page.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>Have you tried filling in the tick box completely so it is black?  That would make it easy to spot open items on a scan of the left margin.  Also, someone posted that circle system of notation which is a bit more complex but when done you end up with something similar.<br><br>Another idea I've seen is to mark items initially with a "-" then cross it so "+" but make the vertical line the whole line width so you end up with a long vertical line down the left and any break in the line (i.e. "-") stands out as an open item.<br><br>Given your coding system, you might want to use a simple vertical line at the very left of your current system.<br><br>Personally, I find that simplicity works best for me.  IOW, my eye has to pause while my brain decodes the symbols unless I have only one symbol I'm looking for ... like a break in a long vertical line or series of big black filled in boxes.  That is much simpler to spot.<br><br>Just some ideas.</div>

<div class="content">Personally I use no coding symbols at all except a dot in the margin to commit myself to an action. I cross out completed tasks with a straight line starting from the dot. And I join adjacent crossed out lines through the dots with a vertical line which makes it very easy to see what is left to be done on the page.<br><br>Works fine for me.</div>

<div class="content">Lillian & Mark - less "pen intensive" means I'm trying to stick as close to "notebook + whatever pen is handy" as possible - I don't want an elaborate scheme of color-coded highlighting, etc.  I tried striking out items completely and found it even more hard to decipher - probably because my handwriting is pretty big and loopy to begin with, so it just made the page even more cluttered.<br><br>Mike - I think coloring in the boxes completely just might work; I'll give it a try.<br></div>
