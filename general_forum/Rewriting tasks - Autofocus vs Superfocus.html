<div class="content">In another thread, I wrote:<br><< However, the rules allow me to re-enter the task however I want, whenever I take action and move the task forward. >><br><br>And Mark Forster responded:<br><< They do? Where? >><br><br><br>I suppose this was a mental carry-over from Autofocus.   There was a principle that "taking action on a task" could mean "rewriting the task to clarify exactly what it is you intend to do".    There are lots of threads on the topic.   <br><br>You don't intend this idea to carry forward to SuperFocus?  You've discussed how important it is to write your tasks carefully -- that was always true in AutoFocus, but now it seems you mean something more, or different, than what you meant then.  Can you elaborate on this?   I think this would be very enlightening.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Let's leave urgent tasks out of the discussion and just concentrate on unfinished tasks.<br><br>The SuperFocus equivalent of AutoFocus would be if all the tasks you put in Column 1 read "Do some work on X".  The "Do some work on...." may of course be understood rather than explicitly stated.<br><br>If you did that with all your tasks, it would be identical to AutoFocus.<br><br>It's the re-entry of Unfinished tasks in Column 2 that makes the big difference between AutoFocus and SuperFocus. The purpose of Column 2 is to force the finishing of tasks once they have been started. That means that once you have allowed a task to get into Column 2 you must finish the task as defined. <br><br>Note that tasks will only get into Column 2 if you define them other than "Do a bit of work on X".  In effect, the entry of tasks into Column 2 is always the result of a voluntary decision to define the task in such a way that it can't be finished in one go. <br><br>In other words you are making a voluntary decision to force the task to be finished. Once you've taken on that commitment, you shouldn't regard yourself as at liberty to back out of it.<br><br>If you're going keep backing out of it, you would be better off keeping all your tasks as "Do some work on X". At least that way you wouldn't be fooling yourself that you are doing SuperFocus.</div>

<div class="content">I think it's worth observing that if nothing is ever urgent, and every task is considered done after one step, you have AF1.</div>

<div class="content">For most unfinished tasks that I enter into Column 2, it works just fine to rewrite them as originally entered.  And SuperFocus drives those tasks to completion.<br><br>But sometimes during the course of working the task, the task demands to be changed.  I've found that SuperFocus still does a great job of driving these tasks to completion.  Here are examples - I think only one of them is "backing out of it", and the rest are legitimate:<br><br>- I started a project, but as I got into it, I got a better idea of what it really entails, and realized that I needed to rewrite it to focus on one particular aspect of the project, leaving the rest for later.  I would re-enter the part that needs focus now in Column 2, but enter the rest of the project as a task in Column 1, last page.  SuperFocus has worked great to drive it to completion but allow it to flex as needed.  Autofocus allows the flex but doesn't have the drive to completion.  <br><br>- I started a project, but the project changes for some reason outside my control, and is no longer a priority.  I would then go through my "wrapping up" procedure, and the project would eventually end up on Column 1 of the last page.  Your answer to Jen in the other thread seems to say that this is OK.  ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1416990" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1416990</a> )<br><br>- I started a project, but now one or more new projects have come along and have forced me to change my priorities.  I don't have bandwidth for the original project right now.  I would go through my "wrapping up" procedure on this one, too, and the project would eventually end up on Column 1 of the last page.   You seem to be saying that I should finish this project as originally written, no matter what, since I have already allowed it into Column 2.<br><br>- I started a project, but now realize it was a mistake to start it at that time.  Bad judgment, frivolity, wanting to do more than realistic, or whatever, just got hold of me.  Now I want to wrap it up and get out, and save it for later.  This is the one scenario where I agree it's "backing out" without a good reason.   I think it's happened only once or twice, during my SuperFocus startup when I was learning the basic mechanics, and when it happened, if I remember correctly, I ended up just deleting the tasks and putting them into Outlook reminders to reconsider in a month or so.   If this became a chronic problem then yes, one may as well do Autofocus.   But I don't see the way I handled it as doing serious violence to the SuperFocus principles.  <br><br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">One thing I really like about Autofocus is how you can enter a task in any particular form, however it occurs to you at the moment.  And then, as you work on it, you can rewrite it to clarify what you really want to do with it.  The idea becomes more focused as you continue to work.  It also spins off other related tasks.<br><br>In other words, Autofocus never **requires** you to define "next actions" like GTD does.   It allows you to define them as the need arises, as you find more clarity on the task or project as you are working on it.<br><br>I thought the same idea applied to SuperFocus, and that's how I have been using it. <br><br>For example, just today, I had a task called "Team XXX Action Items".   Originally I meant "stop keeping your action items in Outlook -- write each one as a task in SF".  And so that's what I started doing.<br><br>As I worked on it, I realized that I needed to make a distinction between my Team XXX Action Items that are tasks for which I am responsible; and my Team XXX Agenda Items, which are things I must make sure get discussed at the next team meeting, since I am the meeting facilitator.  So, I rewrote the task in Column 2, "Sort out Team XXX Action Items from Agenda Items".   It's a completely natural outgrowth of the original task.<br><br>Next pass, I sorted out the items into two lists, but still hadn't entered my own action items onto the SF list.  So, I rewrote the task into Column 2 again, this time calling it "Enter Team XXX Action Items into SF".<br><br>Mark, it sounds like you are saying this is not how you envisioned the system working.  You intended that the unfinished task gets re-entered into Column 2 each time, written in exactly the same way and meaning exactly the same thing.  Am I understanding you correctly?<br><br>If yes, then how would you handle a situation like I describe here?<br><br>And in general, how would SuperFocus allow a task to become more clearly defined as you iterate on it?<br><br>Thanks!!</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I realise that whatever I say you are going to work on things as you think right - and that probably applies to everyone else as well!<br><br>So I can't really quibble with the examples you give of stopping working on a Column 2 task or project before it's finished. They fall within the legitimate decisions which the user of the list can make.<br><br>SF is only a tool after all. And it's up to you how you use the tool.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim<br><br>I don't know why but I have also been working out what the approach is here.  I know you are a veteran on these forums so excuse me if I've understood totally incorrectly and if I take your example above out of context.<br><br>For me, reading the recent discussion threads, I think the trick is the phrase "Do some work on..."<br><br>So in your example above:<br><br>You "(Did some work on) Team XXX Action Items"<br><br>the conclusion of which was the definition was wrong.  No problem. You now have a new definition:<br><br>"stop keeping your action items in Outlook -- write each one as a task in SF"<br><br>which you "Did some work on".  <br><br>Now, a slight aside.  If in your head you are thinking the developing definition of the task is<br><br> "(Do some work on )stop keeping your action items in Outlook -- write each one as a task in SF" <br><br>....then you can put the task in Column 1 at the end of the list when you've done enough for now.  If you are thinking the task is <br><br>"I need to keep workin on this until it's finished" <br><br>...it goes into Column 2.  And if it's something you need to do while onthe current page you reenter it on the current page column2.<br><br>Back on track again.  When you <br><br>"Did some work on" stop keeping your action items in Outlook -- write each one as a task in SF<br><br>you found that you actually needed <br>"to make a distinction between my Team XXX Action Items that are tasks for which I am responsible; and my Team XXX Agenda Items, "<br><br>And your task became <br>"Sort out Team XXX Action Items from Agenda Items"<br><br>and you placed it into column 2<br><br>Back to the aside again - if you meant "(Do some work on)Sort out Team XXX Action Items from Agenda Items" then it could go back into Column 1 after some work.  But if you meant specifically "Sort out Team XXX Action Items from Agenda Items" then it would have to be completed to the bitter end.<br><br>I could see on other occassions that I might be tempted to "re-phrase" a column 2 task like this and enter it into column 1 just to get it out of column 2 because I think I've backed myself into a corner. I think that is what Mark is getting us to guard against because that's just procrastination.  As is abusing the phrase "Do a bit of work on" if we don't actually do something meaningful to move the task forward.<br><br>Back on track again - I don't think Mark is saying you can't have the task develop as you work on it (I got confused on this) and become rephrased.  However, if you write "Sort out Team XXX action items..." and you really meant it then you have to keep adding that to Column 2 until it's finished.  ie: committing<br><br>I don't know whether this is a GTD thing because I think this is where I keep getting stuck with the "Next Action" thing.  The Next Action concept is great but I think (and happy to be corrected) Mark has introduced a _"Do some work on" the Next Action concept_.  And in his technique next actions can be specifically written down "Look in phonebook for a charity" to "Solve world poverty" where, in the latter case, you know or work out or "do some work on" the project that gives you a next action in the moment.  This allows progress of next actions which may not be completed in one sitting as per GTD... infact maybe that's where I'm wrong with my definitions with GTD - I think he said it sould be something you could do in one sitting - anyway that's where Mark helps us out if we can't complete in one sitting but keeps it ever-present :-)<br><br>Hopefully I am not way off here and I hope I haven't made too much work of this!</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Your example of "Team XXX Action Items" is an interesting one, and I had to read through it several times to follow the dynamics of it.<br><br>It sounds to me that in fact the task has still remained "Team XXX Action Items", even though you have written it rather differently each time. In other words, you won't consider it finished until everything covered by the original "Team XXX Action items" is finished.<br><br>So what you are really doing with the rewritten tasks is using them like bookmarks. It's as if I had "Read War and Peace" as one huge task, but every time I re-entered it I put "War and Peace, p. 244" or whatever. You're keeping track of where you've got to in the original project by putting down the next step, but it's still the whole project that you are working on, not just the step.<br><br>That seems perfectly acceptable to me.</div>

<div class="content">Spike - I think you and I are thinking about this in the same way.  I had a fairly clear idea of what I wanted to accomplish -- to get all my own action items into my SF list, and not keep them anymore in subordinate lists.  And I wanted to make sure this gets FINISHED -- not just poke at it now and then.  So yes, I think your analysis is totally valid.<br><br>And by the way, I've only been on this board a little over two years -- there are many others who have been here a lot longer!!</div>

I want to make sure I follow your intended method for a good long while before I even consider making my own changes.   <br><br>Thanks!!</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster wrote:<br><< So what you are really doing with the rewritten tasks is using them like bookmarks. >><br><br>Yes.<br><br>This leads to a question.  On your Progress Report #2 ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/22/whats-next-progress-report-2.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/22/whats-next-progress-report-2.html</a> ), you discuss your management of the "What's Next?" project.<br><br>Can you clarify why you re-enter "What's Next List" in column 1?   <br><br>I understand that the task means "review the list, think about it, enter whatever tasks come to mind to move the project along".   That task, as defined, is completed each time you do it.<br><br>What I *don't* understand is what is driving the larger "What's Next" project toward completion, and what completion of that larger project would really mean. <br><br>Perhaps you don't have a clear idea either -- and that's why it's best in Column 1.  It's an exploratory project, and the ultimate outcome is still "to be determined".   There is really nothing to commit to, at least not yet, except reviewing and thinking about the possibilities.   So it makes sense to keep it in Column 1.<br><br>Again, I'm asking just to understand your intention of how the system should work.   Thanks very much!!</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>There's no one way of managing a project, as I think I might have said somewhere before, and with SuperFocus there are a variety of "settings" which one can apply to turn up or turn down the pressure on getting a major project moving.<br><br>As far as "What's Next List" is concerned I've got it set at the moment on about "medium-low". That's fine for me at the moment, because I have plenty of other things in my life and it is after all only a hobby for me.<br><br>Maybe I'll turn the pressure up to demonstrate what I mean!</div>

<div class="content">Mark - Please do so ! <br><br>Out of topic rant :<br><br>I am SO thankful for all the brilliant material you have given us for FREE since DIT... But I have to admit , I (and I suspect, many others as well) very selfishly wish you could consider yourself out of retirement until  that whole "What next list" is done thoroughly; and only after that could you consider this whole "time management guru" thing as a hobby again. I can't help but feel this is your duty to bring out your latest and most mature theories and tools on time management to the public into a exhaustive, consolidated format (one last, final book - your masterpiece), as soon as possible! (we need it NOW!).<br><br>But then I have to realize that you are just a man, whom have lived a long, intense and productive work life, and as such most definitely deserve to take it easy at this point of your life !<br>I actually find quite unbelievable that you manage to get SO MUCH done on this website while still having "plenty of other things" in your life - that is quite a heavy "hobby" you have here !<br><br>Don't you sometimes wish your brain wasn't so productive of brilliant time management ideas so yo could have been taking some REAL rest since publishing of DIT ?</div>
