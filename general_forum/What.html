<div class="content">Greetings to all,<br><br>As I was reading Mark's response to another on this board, he said something to the effect of, "I'm using an A4 so theres plenty of room for a right hand column"  Is it possible for folks to talk about what kind of tools (pen or pencil?) (spiral or looseleaf) (boxers or briefs--- Oh wait that's probly too much information) they use to implement DIT or its versions?  <br>Could a few brave souls post a picture/sample of what their DIT will do lists look like? <br><br>caught in curiousity's grasp...<br><br>thanks!<br>mary<br>Oh, and is A4 similar to US letter size?(sorry to be so ignorant)<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mary<br>I don't know how this will help you but here goes....<br><br>1. Current Initiative > or = 1hr: closing out fiscal year: 2008<br>2.  Monday's checklist (I have preplanned regular schedules for each day/each month/ and each season/quarter) < or = 2hrs<br>3.  Make appointment for primary care doc/refill meds<br><br>********************************************************************************************************<br>A. After doc appointment go to Home Depot for paint and supplies and ceiling tin tiles<br>B.  Get Mon - Wed veggies<br>C.  Get Mon - Wed protein  (I have menus to refer to)<br><br>If I have extra time, I either refer to my checklists to knock stuff out in advance or use the extra time to create or socialize!  LOL!<br><br>The numbered tasks are MUSTS, the lettered tasks are while I'm out and the other checklists I refer to are ingrained regular stuff used as breaks from the current initiative or to get ahed on another day that I want to free up!!!!  Or if I'm not up to the task of focused thought (pain and/or meds), I can knock out some of the engrained tasks to keep my work time structured.<br><br>gsdsmiles</div>

<div class="content">p.s.  I know that the daily list seems small.........<br>I don't write any batched or checklist items.  The only reason the doc's appointment is one there is because it's a self-induced emergency.  I allowed my meds script to expire.  I never knew that  high level narcotics scripts HAD to be filled within 30 days.  Other meds scripts aren't so carefully governed......oh well.....I live and learn!  The normal doctor visits are on my checklists.</div>

<div class="content">Mary:<br><br>A4 is an international paper size (8.3" x 11.7"), which is a little narrower and longer than American Letter size (8.5" x 11.0").</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mary, you may want to check out the Yahoo DIT group - I believe they have some images.<br><br>My *closed* list structure looks like this: <br><br>Empty home in-tray / list tasks<br>Empty work inboxes / list tasks<br>Work through 'will do' list<br>Look after kids / rest / evening meal<br>Checklist <seperate checklist with simple chores on><br>Make packed lunch (sun - thur)<br><br>I  tend write my tasks as specifically as possible as I feel this helps break down resistance / procrastination and gives an accurate record of what I've  been doing all day!  E.G. 'wrap 4-6 christmas presents'.<br><br>This is my 5th or 6th version, following alterations. I do not use the Current Initiative, despite my efforts I just cannot get on with it! Hope this helps.<br><br><br></div>
