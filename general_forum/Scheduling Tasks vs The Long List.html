<div class="content">In his latest book - which is a very good book and you should read it - Mark Forster, an inventor of time management systems, writes about routines and consistency as fundamental to success in productivity.<br><br>Routines however lend themselves very well to being scheduled on the calendar.<br><br>Mark never criticised that practice as a bad way.<br><br>But the whole idea of the Long List and the tm-systems based there off was also about getting rid of static scheduling.<br><br>I found the Long List far superior in finding just the right time for commencing a task than more rigid scheduling and specially with those repeating tasks I got much better.<br><br>But what a schedule provides and the Long List doesn't, is an inherent agreement on when not to do a task (which means I don't have to think about it) and of frequency of doing the task.<br><br>I feel troubled and conflicted with that.<br><br>How can I use the Long List in conjunction with a schedule without destroying the usefulness of either?</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>There's not really a conflict.<br><br>Think of it this way. There are two broad categories of routine. Routines which relate to a specific time of day, and those which don't.<br><br>Routines which relate to a specific time of day might include:<br><br>Early morning routine<br><br>Travel to work routine<br><br>Opening up the office routine<br><br>Lunchtime routine<br><br>Closing work routine<br><br>Evening routine<br><br>Bedtime routine<br><br>Those may not all be appropriate for your circumstances of course, but I hope you get the point.<br><br>The routines which don't relate to a specific time of day might include:<br><br>Filing<br><br>Emails<br><br>Correspondence<br><br>Payments<br><br>Thinking Time<br><br>Writing<br><br>And so on. Whatever fits your particular situation.<br><br>The routines which relate to a specific time of day don't need to be on your long list because once they are established they should be happening automatically. Those which don't relate to a specific time of day do need to be on your list.</div>
