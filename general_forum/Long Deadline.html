<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Hey everyone,<br><br>I am a college student who is currently in the last year of my undergrad course. <br><br>My life in general is pretty structured and I have used the techniques in Mark's books to create a schedule and establish good working habits.<br><br>However, as a final year student my schedule structure has changed drastically. Other than attending class in the morning, I have the rest of the day free as I have concluded my internship.<br><br>I am swamped with assignments that have far off deadlines i.e two-three months away. Also my midterm quizzes are scheduled for 5-6 months from now.<br><br>Due to me having a lot of unscheduled free time, I seem to have lost the discipline to work and research daily and have fallen into a pattern of procrastinating till the night of a deadline and then pulling an all nighter to finish the job<br><br>Inspite, of vowing to never let it happen again I seem to keep repeating this pattern time and time again.<br><br>This pattern has lead to mediocre work and frayed nerves. I have tried to use methods such as Simple Scanning and the Randomizer but have failed to consistently work with them.<br><br>Could someone please recommend a suitable course of action?</div>

<div class="content">What is keeping you from consistently using a system?  It’s obvious that not doing a thing will not succeed so that needs to be corrected.</div>

<div class="content">Two ideas:<br><br>1. Start a Simple Scanning list by writing down the things you think you should be doing, each on one line. Add any other timely tasks that are on your mind, including fun things you want to do. Start Simple Scanning on that list. If you only do a little bit of work on those big projects, it will be an improvement. If you are repeatedly scanning past these projects and feeling frustrated, rewrite them as smaller tasks.<br><br>2. Try techniques recommended for ADHD, such as "Making ADHD your Superpower | George Cicci | TEDxWVU" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9LRSgxbQqM. I have strong ADHD traits and often experience what you're describing. In fact, I'm doing it right now on some things that will become time crunches next week. ADHD techniques often help me, but not always. My biggest problem is not that I don't have good techniques but that I feel a lot of resistance to them just when I feel overwhelmed and probably need them most.</div>

<div class="content">I can see how Simple Scanning might not work well in this situation. Maybe something like this? (It's happened to me):<br>-- There are many different things you need to do. So you put them all on the list.<br>-- You get traction with some of them.<br>-- As you cycle through the list, you see some of the other items that have not received much attention yet<br>-- The repeated exposure to items that must be done but have not been started yet, is constantly pulling your attention away from items that already have good momentum. <br>-- Thus the focus is diffused, it's difficult to keep momentum, the list becomes tedious, and develops resistance.<br>-- Thus you resist using your list. But this just creates aimlessness, procrastination, etc.<br><br>Does any of that resonate with your experience?<br><br>I have found that No-List systems can really help with this kind of situation. Most likely, you already intuitively know where you should begin -- what your initial focus should be. No-List helps you stay focused there.<br><br>I think Jane is in a similar situation to yours, and has had success with one of the No-List hammer methods. <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2728605#post2729856" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2728605#post2729856</a><br><br>There is a risk with No-List, that it can become somewhat reactive under stress. And that can lead to processing lots of trivia but not really finding a strong focus. So I have found No-List sometimes needs some counterbalance, some framework to keep it more systematic. It can help to keep a separate list of all your work assignments / projects / etc., and review it periodically. That worked for me pretty well for awhile, but if THAT lists starts to grow too fast, it can all fall apart.<br><br>The method I've been using lately is to start each day with a new No List, but keep all my old lists in the same journal, and review them from time to time. The review usually happens when I've already made good progress on whatever is top-of-mind, and I am ready for a break or a diversion. Or sometimes I review the older No-Lists when I am waiting for a meeting to begin, or at other random idle moments. I don't keep any other master lists or project lists. <br><br>I've been doing this method for the last two weeks or so, and it's been great at maintaining focus and eliminating resistance. It never starts to "drag" like the Long List systems sometimes do. It relies completely on your current work and your intuition for developing your sense of focus -- this gives it a real freshness that is constantly renewed. There is no sense of debt as often happens as a Long List gets Longer. The old pages give just the right amount of stability and memory to keep me from forgetting important things and giving me some useful diversions during down time. I write a little more about this method here: <a href="../general_forum/More experimenting with intuition and focus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2730943</a><br><br>I think the nicest benefit is that you only cycle through your actual area of current focus -- you don't get distracted by all the older stuff in the notebook, until you are *ready* for such distractions. This helps maintain freshness and focus.</div>

<div class="content">Emma:<br><br>You wrote:<br><br><<I am swamped with assignments that have far off deadlines i.e two-three months away. Also my midterm quizzes are scheduled for 5-6 months from now.>><br><br>One of Mark's recommendations for a project that is due in 6 months is to start working on it today. Search for "little and often" and "current initiative" to find many posts on this site that may give you ideas. <br><br>(The "current initiative" is the first thing you work on every day before you do anything else. It can be a small step but when done everyday, you will see progress. That's "little and often.")<br><br>Another thing I would do when I was in school, and it depends on the nature of your assignments, is I would just flat-out focus on one assignment. I would take that assignment as far as I could until I hit a wall (need to do more research, need to interview someone) and then move to the next one and go flat-out on that. If what you're working on requires you to keep lots of variables and prep in your head, then focusing on just one project for an entire week, say, could keep you in that zone.<br><br>Another thing we would do is make appointments or agreements with each other. I'd know of a fellow student who would have a poster or paper due, and we'd agree to work on Monday from 1-6pm on our respective projects and then report back on our progress. There's something about making a social commitment that's really powerful for some people.<br><br>Good luck, and let us know your progress!</div>
