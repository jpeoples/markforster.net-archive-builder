<div class="content">So, I'm hoping that Mark, et al. can prod me a little bit into making a decision on a system for the Lenten challenge! <br><br>I've narrowed it down to either a true no list or "no list" list, as a just don't think something like FVP is going to work for me. I'm currently thinking of either doing the "New Question" without a list at all, or with the Ask-Write-Do-Repeat no-list method given in Mark's recent post, or do a 5/2 no-list system with or without the New Question.<br><br>So, help inspire me to a decision! Please! LOL</div>

<div class="content">Aaron:<br><br>I'm just in the process of producing a blog post on a new system which can be used with or without the New Question.<br><br>It may well not be the one you feel you want to go for, but you might want to hold off a decision until it's posted (probably within the next two days).</div>
