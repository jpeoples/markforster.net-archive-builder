<div class="content">Since folks fed my ego, er, liked my written description of my manual DWM system that I posted last week, I tried my hand at an animation of the sort that Andreas did for AF4.<br><br>I made two versions: <br>1) a PDF which you can view/download here: <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/29225814/Demonstration-of-Mark-Forster-s-DWM-Time-Management-System" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/29225814/Demonstration-of-Mark-Forster-s-DWM-Time-Management-System</a><br>2) a movie which you can view here:<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4nEiJvNl-0" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4nEiJvNl-0</a> (the first screen stays up for ~30 seconds... then things get rolling)</div>

<div class="content">3 things:<br><br>1) Very well done animation, with a pinch of humor to boot! <br>2) Your daughter (I watched a few of your YouTube videos) is ADORABLE!!<br>3) Laughed out loud when I read: "Make Charoset". Chag Sameach to you and your family. <br><br>Super job!</div>

<div class="content">1st reply didn't post (for at least 5 minutes)... so I posted another. Odd.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Avrum... the kid is even more hilarious now - I haven't posted a vid of her to Youtube in nearly a year (most stuff goes to Flickr or Facebook these days).</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>That was excellent!  More ego food?!?<br><br>It's quite a tribute not only to your own initiative, but to Mark's creativity and the forum folk, all getting involved, most without fear, favour or financial reward.<br><br>It also a refreshing return to "on topic", although I must confess I enjoy some of the more esoteric stuff that Group Norm, Mike and Co post, even if I don't understand some of it.</div>

<div class="content">Hello,<br>Thank you for that, Sarah.<br><br>I have a question though that has probably been dealt with elsewhere, but I haven't seen asked directly.<br><br>You simply work through the list in sequence.  Is that correct, or should you cycle through 1 day until no tasks stand out (similar to AF1), and then move on to the next day (though without the AF rules of dismissal, of course)?<br><br>I wasn't 100% clear from the rules, and I can see benefits to both.  You could say "do whatever works", and that's fine - although I've learned that often with Mark's systems it is the nuances that create the right tensions and I wouldn't want to fiddle unintentionally.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Ben.</div>

<div class="content">Ben,<br>From Mark's original DWM/DIT2/AF5 post on 1feb10 ...<br><<5. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.>><br><br>One long list of all (tasks in all) active pages (days). So, you cycle through the tasks in one loop, not multiple loops for each day. IIRC, Mark had clarified it'll take too long if you do multiple loops.</div>

<div class="content">It looks like you used the same program or template to create the spreadsheet as Andreas used for the AF4 animation. <br><br>What is that program/template?<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">James,<br>I actually used Keynote (Apple's presentation software), with each "step" being one slide.  The animation part was easy because I could just duplicate the last slide and then move the arrow object and quickly format the text as necessary.  And Keynote can export to PDF and, more importantly for me for this project, Quicktime.<br><br>(I tried it initially with Numbers (the Apple spreadsheet) but it wasn't as intuitive to animate the step by step process there, nor could I have exported it as a movie.)</div>
