<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-9 14:25</div>
<div class="content">Problem:<br><br>Frequently, I am not sure if I could proceed to the next page without dismissing the current page. Because I can't remember whether I have touched on any C1 item in this session.<br><br>C2 does not have to be monitored at all since all the items in C2 must be struck through before turning to the next page. If there's anything unmarked, I simply can't move on. Period.<br><br>C1, on the contrary, is a bit harder to track as I can't be confident  if I have fulfilled the minimum requirement to keep this page active.<br><br>After having crossed off trivial C1 item, the fact is easily forgotten if I stay on the page for a fair amount of time, dealing mostly with Big Rock C2 items.<br><br>With a page that has many items already crossed off, worked-on-during-this-visit item is almost indistinguishable from the other marked off items from past sessions.<br><br>A Hack:<br><br>There may be several options to alleviate this problem, but I've found the following to be simple and motivating:<br><br>Put two Post-Its on the current page. One is just a bookmark to show it's "current", and the other is a kind of tickler to remind you of this key question -- "Have you worked on C1?".<br><br>* Put the "current" Post-It on, well of course, the current page.<br><br>* You have one more Post-It on the same page, to remind that "you haven't worked on any item on C1 since you arrived at this page".<br><br>* Once you address one item from C1, you peel off and move this Post-It to the next active page, while the other, i.e. the "current" bookmark, still left on.<br><br>* Continue working on the current page until no more tasks feel ready to be done. Then you go to the next active page with the "current" Post-It. So the "current" tag usually follows one step behind, chasing after the "C1?" tag.<br><br>* No matter how hard you worked on items from C2, as long as you haven't touched anything from C1, your "C1?" tag should stay on the current page. Then you will know, at a glance, that you can't move forward without having to dismiss the rest.<br><br>* If you've dismissed the page, advance both marks together to the next active page.<br><br>Tips:<br><br>* You may use different colors for each bookmark; e.g. yellow for the "current" and pink for the "C1?". Or simply get by with one color, just writing the label on each. I personally prefer the latter, for I can't remember which color is which.</div>

<div class="content">That's a good idea.  I also had the same problem and solved it by writing the date in the upper margin whenever I first come to a page.  If I take action on any C1 item, I put a checkmark next to the date.  If there's no checkmark, then I can't leave the page without dismissing all the C1 tasks.  <br><br>It does the same thing as your stickies.  But it also gives me a record of how fast I'm moving through my list.<br><br>People who like the tactile and visual would probably like your stickies better than my checkmark.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I've faced the same problem, and solved it in the following way:<br><br>1. Whenever I start working on a task, the first thing I do is draw a dot beside it in the list.  I can't remember who suggested this, but I find it very useful...by doing this, I'm effectively telling myself "this is what I'm going to do now".  It's like I'm committing to the task.<br><br>2. When I've finished working on a task, I cross out the task itself, but I don't join the crossing-out line with the dot -- I leave a small gap.<br><br>3. Then, when I'm ready to leave the page, I join the crossing-out line with the dot, and also draw vertical lines connecting the dot with any completed tasks above or below -- just like Mark suggests in his instructions so you can quickly see which tasks haven't been crossed out yet.<br><br>It sounds a bit awkward to write down like this, but I find it works brilliantly -- I can immedateiy see which tasks I've done on the current run-through of the page, because they have dots beside them that aren't joined to a horizontal or vertical line.</div>

<div class="content">My solution:<br><br>When I move on to the next page, I put a checkbox at the top of the page.  <br><br>When I've done a column one task, I check it off.  <br><br>I know not to move on unless all the checkboxes at the top of the page have been checked off.</div>

<div class="content">It started out as a quest for administrative aid to the system. I began by trying Seraphim's idea of date and checkmark but unfortunately didn't work out for me as I often have several round of my list within a day.<br><br>Using two bookmarks not only solved the problem but also turned out to be a great motivator in processing the list.<br><br>Now, I'm giving a serious thought about cutting "C1?"  tag into a shape of comic bubble with a screaming "Help Us!!" on it. That would effectively make me feel like a Superman, saving lives of remaining tasks by touching one of them.<br><br>I will be a HERO! Mhahahahaha!!<br><br>(As a sidenote, "C!?" tag is not a bookmark in the strict sense of the word as it doesn't have to stick out from the edge of the book. Actually, I put it well inside the edge.)</div>

<div class="content">You can also just put a dot next to items done on C1 and NOT cross them out till you've finished C2 and are ready to move on. <br><br>Presumably you are putting a dot next to them when you start anyways. <br><br>And if you forget to cross them out before moving on, no big deal, you'll see that when you cycle back to the page later.</div>

<div class="content">I like crossing out a task horizontally with a ruler (psychologically it helps me to feel more ordered and meaning business and also brings back happy memories of my school days). This is the first step.<br><br>WHEN I'M READY TO TURN THE PAGE, I go through and put vertical lines at one end of the horizontal ones so that as more and more tasks are achieved it turns into just 1 vertical line (as discussed in past posts since beginning of AF).<br><br>Benenfits are 3 -fold: it gives me another opportunity for satisfaction for my accomplishment in this session, it gives an easier visual sense of what is still left to do on that page at a glance to the side and, very importantly, it tells me whether I have already worked on a task in this session. <br><br>If I have no purely horizontal lines in C1, then I haven't done a task in this session. And if there is one, then I have. Very simple process that doesn't have to engage my mind at all.<br><br>Oh, and like others have shared too - 2 small post-it bookmarks of different colours. 1 for current page and 1 for last page. Another opportunity for satisfaction when moving the current one to next page.<br><br>Could look for a bookmark with my own personal Superman/hero/role model on to stimulate my motivation as weeblog mentions. Or a ruler?</div>

<div class="content">For some reason I overlooked Kiwi Eric above. So my post appears a bit overlaboured and unnecessary. Thanks for drawing my attention to an excellent tip ubi.</div>

<div class="content">I just realized that KE's dot trick obviates the need for any flag or tag or bookmark!  When you visit a page, you are required to choose one of two options: (1) pick a task, or (2) dismiss the page. If you choose to dismiss, you visit the next page. So as soon as you pick a task, you place the dot. There shouldn't be any lonely dots hanging out on any other page. You can take action on the chosen task immediately, or take a break.  Either way, there will be exactly one page with one or more dots on it (that haven't been connected to lines). If you now close your notebook and open it some time later, you can quickly flip through all the active pages and look for a page that has one or more dots on it – that is the current page!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to the ideas in this thread, I am now using three colored post it flags. See this picture: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/426952/superfocus-flags.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/426952/superfocus-flags.jpg</a><br><br>The top green flag says 'Start'. I put this flag on the page I start my day with. The reason for this is that I sometimes go to the list too slowly, so the idea is that at the end of the day I should have passed the page with the Start flag at least once (at which point I can rotate it vertically, so I know I did at least one full cycle of Superfocus).<br><br>The middle orange flag says 'C1!'. As soon as I acted on one Column 1 task, I move this flag to the next page, so I know I don't have to do that anymore.<br><br>And the bottom pink flag says 'Current', which means that this is the page I am working on right now.<br><br>I don't think I like the dots idea because that is not so visually striking as those brightly coloured flags. They are very easily pulled off and put somewhere else, so I like it.</div>

<div class="content">I like the tags. I also mark the last page (where the new C1 tasks go), since I'm flipping to that one all the time.</div>

<div class="content">Tijl:<br><br>Thank you for posting the photo of your notebook. You seem to use colors AND labels at the same time. That would further reinforce the visual cue that these tags will bring. By the way, could you elaborate on the marks before the dots for each item? (Seems to me like the shape of letter F or number 9)<br><br>Will:<br><br>Yes, I too am using a third tag to indicate the last page. Actually, I've borrowed some tricks from the following page.<br><br>PigPogPDA – A Moleskine Hacked into a Complete System<br><a href="http://pigpog.com/2007/01/20/pigpogpda-a-moleskine-hacked-into-a-complete-system/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://pigpog.com/2007/01/20/pigpogpda-a-moleskine-hacked-into-a-complete-system/</a></div>

<div class="content">I skimmed through the Pigpogpage and didn't see anything of interest.<br>I <br>keep a 3M movable tab on the last page. For the active page, I draw a slash at top.  When I pick my C1, I make it a checkmark.</div>

<div class="content">I use a post it on the page I'm working on and I made a card-stock bookmark/ruler for the page I'm adding new C1 tasks to. I'm using a large Moleskine but because I write long-ish tasks and like to have room to jot a little around them, I use facing pages for C1 and C2. I put C1 tasks on the right page as that's the most comfortable page for me to write on and read. I found I wanted a margin on the page to leave the space around them. So I made the bookmark the right width to create that margin. I don't draw a line with it, I just leave it in place and start writing to the right of it. <br><br>I haven't noticed a problem with determining if I've done a C1 task or not, but I will institute the 'don't draw the vertical line to connect the cross-outs until leaving the page' system as in Kiwi Erik's #3. Thanks.<br><br>And to take the opportunity to test that the edit function is working, I'll add, once again, my amazement with the simplicity SF and how well it works for me. I'm still loving it.</div>

<div class="content">@weeblog: The marks before the dots are dates. At the top of each page I have a date that says on which day I started this page, while in front of each dot I write the date on which I finished the task. I only write the day, not the month or year since that will be obvious from the date at the top. I don't really use the dates that often, but it takes only a second to write it in front of the dot so when I do want to know when I finished something, it is there.</div>

<div class="content">Tijl:<br><br>Thanks again for your input. I'll add that to my Someday/Maybe list. Or should I put it directly into my SF list and let the system decide? <g><br><br><br>Alan:<br><br>I don't know whether it has something to do with the fact that I'm an lefty, but anyway, as I'm not good at drawing lines straight (especially horizontal one). I don't actually 'strike through' items that's been worked on (instead, I just put 'X' before each for the better legibility). So your 'slash and checkmark' idea is very much applicable for my situation. I'll add this too to my 'things to try out' list, though I'm more than happy with my tags, at least, for now.</div>

<div class="content">OhNiners,<br><br>Yes, I'm putting a dot next to them when I start working on them. But I can't resist the urge to cross them out (with 'X' in my case) as soon as I finish woking. There's so much attraction in instant gratification. :-)</div>
