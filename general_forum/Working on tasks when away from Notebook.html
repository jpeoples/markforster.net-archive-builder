<div class="content">I'm curious on how other people are handling this scenario regarding their autofocus ist.<br><br>When away from the list, you work on a task that you know is on the list. It might or might not be on current "active" page.  Progress is made but task is not completed.<br><br>When you return to the list do you:<br><br>A) Find that item on the list, re-enter it on the last page and cross it off from the earlier page?<br><br>B) Leave the task where it is since you didn't complete it?<br><br>So far, I've been using B approach, but it tends to end up being the last remaining items on a page.<br><br>-John<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I use the "A" approach. Just helps me to acknowledge my progress on the 'little and often" and increases my motivation. :o)</div>

<div class="content">How about a compromise? When you get back to your list and the task you did is not on your current page, don't take the time to hunt it down but continue processing that page. Once you naturally get back to the page with that task, smile to yourself, say "already did that", cross it off and rewrite it then. So you get the "win" and can proceed to the next page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi John<br><br>I do exactly as Andreas suggests - when I reach the page with the task on I cross it off and readd it at the end of the last page.  It keeps the lists flowing and avoids those "uncompletable" pages.</div>
