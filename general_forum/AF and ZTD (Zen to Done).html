<div class="content">It would be interesting to hear if anyone here is trying to integrate AF with Leo Babauta's ZTD system.<br><br>For those not familiar with ZTD (which is short for 'Zen to Done'): It's a 'system' (a series of blog articles and an ebook) developed by Leo Babauta (of <a href="http://zenhabits.net" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net</a> ) that basically follows the GTD workflow (Collect - Process - Organize - Review - Do), but adds a little Covey-style planning - 'Big Rocks' (BRs) for the week and 'Most Important Tasks' (MITs) for the day, which you should try to do early in the day - plus some emphasis on routines, and generally stresses the importance of acquiring habit changes slowly, but thoroughly.<br><br>At about the same time the AF beta started, I got involved into an online group that tried to implement ZTD's 10 'habits' - one habit per month - but unfortunately a server move gone bad killed the discussion forum (at least, for now).</div>

<div class="content">Anyone? <br><br>I might add that ZTD only instructs you to schedule 1 to 3 MITs for the day ('Big Rocks' included), not to schedule your whole day. So it's not all that different from Mark's 'Current Initiative' from DIT, and could play nicely with AF.</div>

<div class="content">OK I'll bite :)<br><br>I think the  scheduled 'MITs' and early in the day 'Big Rocks' goes against the valuable philosophy of 'little and often',<br><br>And just the name 'BIG... ROCK...' conjures up resistance - see that boulder coming... look ouuuut!!! :)<br><br>For long resisted tasks I find it can be helpful to write the task with an action, ANY action following, eg (silly examples but gives an idea)<br><br>Load dishwasher - stack plates on side<br>Pay bill - write cheque out<br><br>Then either just carry on doing other actions, or do the one action and re-write the task on the end of the list with another action.<br><br>Another thing I find helpful is to try for a 10+ minute 'head start'  on certain tasks at a good time in the day, it can make it easier to continue later, also the 10 minutes usually turns into 20-30 minutes and a useful amount done.<br><br>Both the above I feel go well with the 'little and often' approach.<br><br>cheers,<br>Pete.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I'm pretty sure ZTD justifies writing down three MITs for the day by claiming you can't reasonably do more than three big tasks in one day. So by writing down your MITs you are effectively planning out your whole day (though perhaps not in minute detail). <br><br>I tried ZTD and not once did I get all three MITs done. And I would spend my days feeling guilty, first because I didn't complete my first MIT by a certain hour, then because I hadn't completed it at all. I simply don't work well with such restrictions.<br><br>If I were to integrate the two systems my MITs would be the same each day:<br><br>1. AF time<br>2. AF time<br>3. AF time <br><br>Those are MITs I could accomplish :-D</div>
