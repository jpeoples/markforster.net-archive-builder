<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I'm hope I'm not the only one wondering... Will we be needing extra tools for AF v2.   i.e. Calendar (have already), etc.<br><br>With notebook, pen and highlighter at hand, I'm waiting anxiously to see what new techniques you've created for us in AF v2.  I have found Autofocus to be one of the best systems I've used for managing my multiple tasks, it really has helped my productivity and thinking process. <br><br>I look forward to your reply.</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>You'll need exactly the same tools as you need for AF v. 1, e.g. notebook, pen, highlighter. The only change is that it won't matter how many lines per page the notebook has.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - Thank you for your response.  I'm ready to roll with the new Autofocus then.  Looking forward to getting started.<br><br>Jacqueline - No, there are still a few of us left keeping the home fires burning for when everyone comes back, and preparing for your return.  ;-D</div>
