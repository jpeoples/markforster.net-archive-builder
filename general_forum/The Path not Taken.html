<div class="content">AF can be used to emphasis choices we make and where they are leading. To really focus your days consider that you have about 1000 useable minutes per day and once spent cannot be re-spent, nor can you be given more.<br><br>In the left column we have as we do now a list of things that could be done. In the right column go the things we choose to take action on, be they trivial or life changing.<br><br>At the end of the day/week/month the list on the left is regarded as "the path not taken" - the choices we reject or avoid. The path on the right is the chosen path. At the bottom of the right hand column we write a comment on where our choices are leading us. For example "successful and productive, feeling very accomplished" or "running myself into the ground and not taking care of myself or the people I care about". Similarly at the bottom of the left column we summarise what we want to avoid doing or what we believe about those kinds of tasks.<br><br>The aim is to maximise happiness and success and minimise regret or disappointment for the day/week/month ahead.<br><br>The system can also be worked "backwards" by writing in the desired outcome at the bottom of the right hand side and then creating activities directly on the right hand side. Otherwise they can be entered on the left and moved over to make action more deliberate and intentional. I suppose one could use events of the day + my response = quality of the outcome and rate each on a 1 to 10 scale.</div>

<div class="content">Being able to review what was done is one reason why I like separating done from undone activities.  I never thought to take the review as far as you suggest, but it's an interesting idea.</div>

<div class="content">But since actions have their own natural momentum leading to continuance, it shouldn't be necessary to review them provided that the system is designed to make the most of that momentum.<br><br>I realize that up to now in the process of designing AF/SF systems I've been putting too much emphasis on what isn't getting done and not enough on what is getting done.</div>

<div class="content">I find that starting the day with a blank sheet and adding items only as you start them (an 'Actives' page) can sometimes be of great benefit for a variety of reasons.  <br><br>However, at other times, it seems like this is only an extra step and draws my attention away from the core system.</div>
