<div class="content">I saw an article about this yesterday on a statups/programming site. Some interesting comments: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8122171<br><br>The app is free so I wonder what they are going to do to make money. Also interesting that they have Dan Ariely (Behavioral Economist, author, TED speaker, ...) as "Chief Behavior Officer".<br><br>In terms of use as a system, I see they combine planning your day by scheduling them, habit tracking, and to do lists, and the ability to say "do it tomorrow", although not in a closed list way. Maybe having to pick time slots to do things is a type of closed list. <br><br>Combining todo lists with daily habits is something I have been wondering about lately. On the subreddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect</a> they make a 7x7 grid on a notecard or piece of paper and draw an X on it for every day that they do something (for example, exercise). I think that lack of consistency is something that keeps me back.<br><br>I haven't tried the app.</div>

<div class="content">Ben Franklin kept a grid of 13 habits, marking each one in the evening. He started by focusing on one habit for a week? maybe a month?<br><br>This program looks promising. I've signed up for the web and Android announcements.<br><br>I like how they show recent history for the habits each day. On Wednesday, I can see if I'm ahead or behind on them.<br><br>I often put a grid of daily tasks and habits at the top of my week list. I'm good with things I want to do each morning, but not so good by evening.<br><br>Syncing to Google calendar is very useful.</div>

<div class="content">I tried something like this once. I wanted to see two things: <br><br>1. Would software be a better arbiter of how I should spend my discretionary time, than say, me. (No. I have a pretty good grasp of:<br><br>a: What I need to do <br>b: What I tend to do when I need to do something)<br> <br>2. Would I be more likely to do something if it were suggested by a 3rd party rather than me?<br>(Unfortunately, no).<br><br>Curious to hear if anyone makes it past the honeymoon phase with this product. Say, 4-6 weeks of continued use.</div>

<div class="content">I never used Timeful, but I started using SkedPal just after the program was bought by Google and shut down. See <a href="http://www.skedpal.net" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.skedpal.net</a> for details.</div>
