<div class="content">I like keeping a little pocket notebook for DIT, especially with the Randomizer.   There's something about the tactile feel of paper that makes me feel more grounded, and more free to express my thoughts.  <br><br>Lately I've been using the Moleskine color-of-the-month notebook.   <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/us/collections/model/product/12-months-colour-a-month-daily-planner-in-12-notebooks-pocket" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.moleskine.com/us/collections/model/product/12-months-colour-a-month-daily-planner-in-12-notebooks-pocket</a><br><br>But I also capture lots and lots of tasks in Outlook (at work), and in Any.do (for personal/home).<br><br>I've been struggling what is the best approach to handle this dual lifestyle (paper and electronic).<br><br>I've tried two basic approaches:<br><br>(1) Live in the paper notebook.  Keep a recurring task "Outlook tasks" and another recurring task "Any.do".  When the Randomizer hits those tasks, I switch over to the electronic list for a Pomodoro or two.   Then I switch back to my notebook.<br><br>(2) Treat the two lists as one continuous list.   I.e., when the Randomizer takes me beyond the last task in my paper notebook, I keep counting from the beginning of the electronic notebook.   Then when I reach the end of the electronic notebook, I continue from the beginning of the paper notebook.<br><br>The second approach seems to work better with the Randomizer for some reason.  I guess it's because it helps ensure ALL the tasks get processed, without emphasizing either paper or electronic tasks too much.<br><br>Has anybody else run into these kinds of process questions, and found any solutions?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim,<br><br>like you, I like the feel of paper lists. More grounded is a nice way to describe it! But, I also think electronic lists are more efficient, especially for (often) repeating tasks. The way I'm handling it now is to have "work electronic lists" as a recurring task on my paper DIT-list. I've implemented my recurring stuff in OmniFocus, and so far I'm just selecting the tasks from there that I feel like doing, and I switch back to paper when I feel like it, but that doesn't really feel right. I'm thinking to include a task "switch back to paper" on every (electronic) page, so I can work the electronic list with the randomizer, just like the paper list.</div>

<div class="content">Nicole - have you tried keeping them as one continuous list?</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure I want to treat them as one continuous list, because my electronic list is mainly made up of routine stuff. I like to be able to do that kind of stuff several times during the day, as distractions from my paper list, where usually the bigger chunks of work are. I'm basically using your first approach, I'll post here how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">Nicole - that makes sense.   For me, the misc stuff and the more important stuff is about equally like to appear on my paper list or my electronic, so maybe that's why I like to treat them as one continuous list.</div>

<div class="content">I’m impressed that you can go back and forth. I have tried to work mine together but not successfully. The double entry part does not work for me, like having two watches, never knowing what time it actually is.<br><br>I have set it up OmniFocus, with Day one, Day two, etc. for lists of about 25 items. The paper journal I bought is a Fabriano, 8.25 inches by 6.25 inches, spiral bound to lay flat. Now I use it to draw ideas and OmniFocus for the list. with the older iPhone version of OmniFocus to capture things when I am out. Paper is much faster to write in, easier to count and doesn't require syncing. <br><br>Curious as to how you two work both list in the future. The Moleskine color of the month books are nice, I may go back to paper!?!</div>

<div class="content">Depending on the content of each list, how about switching around a particular time or times of day?<br><br>Of course if there's a nagging feeling something needs doing on the other list, it'd probably be good to hop back there and then.</div>
