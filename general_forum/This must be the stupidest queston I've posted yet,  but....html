<div class="content">If, in AF2, I do the last item on my list, but I don't complete it, and then I re-enter that item at the bottom of the list, and then go back to the list, and obey the injunction to always work up from the bottom, won't I immediately re-encounter the item I just re-entered?  And won't I have the feeling of going around in circles?<br>I am sure I am missing some crucial step here and would welcome any guidance.<br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>Yes, you would start *looking* at the tasks from the task you have just re-entered - what's the problem with that? You don't actually do that task (unless it stands out of course).<br><br>I think you need to read the instructions again. You seem to have got the idea that you always have to do the last item on the list.<br><br>Step 2 in the instructions reads:<br><br>'2. Work backwards from the last item *looking* at each task in turn until a task “stands out”.' (emphasis added)</div>
