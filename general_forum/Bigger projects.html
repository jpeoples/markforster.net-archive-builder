<div class="content">Hi there,<br><br>I am working with AF4 and get along with it fine.<br>My problem lies with bigger projects. <br><br>How do other members organize and keep track of those?<br>I know "work on it often and little" but this is not enough  for me. I have many entries on my AF4 list for these projects but need to keep track of them separately as they are too complex for a simple list. <br><br>Currently I have the following projects:<br><br>- Find a new house<br>- Change jobs<br>- Learn a new programming language<br><br>All of these require constant monitoring, many multiple actions, will take quite some time to accomplish and may have unforeseen roadblocks and difficulties down the road. <br><br>This may not be a question for AF4 directly but I'd be interested on how others are organizing bigger, more complex, long, and more difficult projects. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Renfrew</div>

<div class="content">Hi Renfrew.  I'm using DWM but I know that a lot of people are finding AF4 best for them.  <br><br>There's been a huge amount of discussion on this forum on how to handle projects, and perhaps others can direct you to that.  AF4 and all the other Autofocus versions are not specifially project management systems, but they can help you to manage your time while you are working on your projects.   It's not impossible to handle alll your projects by putting the individual tasks directly into AF4 or any of the other Autofocus systems, and I think some people manage to do this, but I think it's easier to keep your projects in whichever medium suits your way of working, whether that's a manual system or an online system, and just put something like "Work on Project X" as your entry on AF4.  When you come to that item and feel moved to action it, then go to your project and work on it for whatever length of time feels right, then re-enter it on the list.  <br><br>Some  people set aside a block of time every day to work on one or more projects, and only work their Autofocus list when they've completed that time block. <br><br>Best wishes for your projects, and keep us posted on what you decide.</div>

<div class="content">same as Jupiter and Margaret:<br><br>in addition:<br>I put project reference and actions in a paper based foldersystem (hanging files), when the support material is exclusive paper and in a computer based foldersystem when the support material is digital.<br>In this files I collect supportmaterial and a sheet of paper or an textfile (plaintext) with possible next steps - let's say an actionlist. It's important to decide between paper and digital for hosting the actionlist. Two places leads to less productivity and more confusion.<br>The files (paper) or folders (digital) got a tags. I name the hanging file for a Project 'P1_projectname' and the digital folder 'C1_projectname'.<br>On my AF list I write e.g. 'P1: do task' or 'C1: do task'. Thus I see at a glance where I find the support material and the actionlist.<br>As I work on my AF list and the entry stands out I do the task and refer to the Folder named 'P1_projectname' for more possible tasks which I could enter to my AF list, for reviewing and unclutter supportmaterial and for brainstorming the next tasks or whatever.<br><br>- Jens</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the hints. <br>Apparently mixing tasks on AF4 and big projects is not a good idea. <br><br>Projects have to be kept different. This probably where the system (AF4) is not designed for. <br><br>I loke the constant "push" that AF4 gives (when circling through the list) but have not found a way to integrate my bigger projects (maybe via reminders  to take action) into the list. <br><br>Renfrew</div>

<div class="content">I believe af4 is dedicated to action. Project to think and handle projects. Avoid double beam  but may be use af for what it does thebest ie Doing stuff</div>

<div class="content">AF is centered on managing your actions (workflow). It is not a project management or planing tool. I use project management concepts to develop them and put either the tasks I have defined in my actions system as they are or I put "Work on Project X" and refer to that material at that point.<br><br>The first method ensures that the project as a whole gets more of my attention at the expense of sacrificing other areas of my life. The second method is exactly the opposite.</div>

<div class="content">@Renfrew<br><br>AF gave me a way of dealing with terrible procrastination and deciding what task to do next.<br><br>The act of writing on paper, crossing items out and the top down review process is very satisfying and natural. If I could make it work on paper I'd stick with it for projects.<br><br>BUT<br><br>....I've had a terrible time managing projects with AF and on paper. The nature of parent to child tasks, nested projects was un-doable on paper and blew up my AF attempts to control them. I created tabbed pages in my moleskin but it ended up killing the simplicity and productivity of AF I had with just the sequential pages of UNCATEGORISED tasks.<br><br>Part of the problem to work out what task to do within a project context. What is a real milestone task vs not important right now. <br><br>Enter the digital task/project app. In the past they just became endless long lists that just kept growing thanks to my procrastination gorilla (I reckon weighs about 800 pounds :)<br><br>So my dedicated AF project pages failed as did the option to work it on paper. Maybe because AF represents a natural form of multi-tasking versus the overwhelming confusing kind of multi-tasking in a digital format.<br><br>I've got some success with the following. <br><br>Discretionary time (of my choice): Use AF in the moleskin<br>Time oriented (responsibility for producing a result by date x): Use Things ((<a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://culturedcode.com/things/)</a> or similar app which supports contexts/tagging.<br><br><br>All projects with tasks with deliverable dates go into Things (e.g Client X > create logo mock-up) , all else goes into my AF moleskin (e.g get haircut, send in coupon)<br><br><br>I know you won't have specific knowledge of the Things app so this is a generic way I think that can be applied to all digital project apps.<br><br>Though I failed in the past using software, I applied the AF task selection approach to the program. <br><br>1. In 'view all tasks mode' use the AF task selection approach<br>2. Selected those tasks and move them to the 'focus' section of the application. (Things 'Today view')<br>3. Those not done get unmarked and start again at 1.<br><br>One of the benefits of projects with tonnes of child tasks and dependencies is that you can categorise them. I think in the past this was for priority and the reason I failed.  Now I mark every task with one of the following tags from each line (no due dates) <br><br>- Milestone (if i only get this done today the day is worth it, Task (bonus to get done)<br>- Easy, Effort, Challenge<br>- 1day, 3hr, 1hr, 20m, 15m, 5m<br><br>For Project titles only (with due dates), I add<br>- 1, 2, 3, 4 etc (these represent the urgency of the deadline, 1 being the soonest)<br><br>What these tags do is allow me in the app to filter down the overwhelming list into something more AF like on paper. Again I mentioned this because I procrastinate and one of the reasons was multi-tasking and computers by there nature encourage it, one little email here, a web site there and the days over for me on journey procrastinate.<br><br>So....in the Things app I simply filter all my projects and tasks by entering.<br><br>1, Milestone<br><br>and then can sort these out by time based on the block of time available. This works because I might have a day with only a few hours available versus a whole day.<br><br>Once the milestones are done I then can go<br><br>1, Tasks <br><br>Hope this translated well.<br><br>Jahan<br><br>I have had the side effect of almost moving to digital exclusively which still irks me because the last thing I wanted to do was contextualise the simple tasks. Miss the moleskin very much. Still a work in progress so any advise of how to marry them or move completely to paper I love to hear your ideas. (Tried todoodlist.com but it clashed with AF)</div>

<div class="content">For most multi-step projects, the actions become apparent as I start to work on them.  For the complex ones, buying a house, for instance, I need a separate project plan.<br><br>Your system is likely different from mine, but my notes and personal Autofocus list reside in a moleskine notebook:  Notes at the front, and the list at the back.  Any bigger goals that I need to flesh out or have multiple moving parts are given a page in the front section as needed.  My Autofocus list item will usually be the name of the project and the page number of my notes on the topic [Buy a new house (page x).]  When I come to that list item, I know that my project planning and notes are with me in the same notebook.  If I find that a project is getting passed over, I'll cut down some of the resistance by rephrasing the project as an action, still referencing the page number [Call realtor re: house tour (page x)].<br><br>I've found this approach simple and effective.  Now if I can somehow integrate a paper calendar (I'm currently reliant on Google), I'll have really found what works for me.</div>

<div class="content">I'm somewhat the same as Ryan.  I name my projects and put them alphabetically in a binder (home) or OneNote notebook (work).  My AF4 list mentions the projects by name, just the same as it mentions little tasks.  The project page can be organized whatever way makes the project work: lists of tasks, notes, diagrams, whatever.</div>

<div class="content"><Now if I can somehow integrate a paper calendar (I'm currently reliant on Google), I'll have really found what works for me. ><br><br>How about use a pocket notebook, with each right hand page as a calendar for each day, and the left hand pages as an AF list.<br><br>One adjustment that could be done is start to an AF page afresh each day, opposite the day's calendar page, then close it at the end of the day if it's not full.<br><br>This would also allow you to put AF items a day ahead, or even a few days ahead, a bit like DIT.</div>

<div class="content">@smileypete:<br><br>Maybe a daily diary such as you describe would work for me.  I do worry about having tasks spread out among so many multiple pages, but not doing so might limit my productivity.  I've been shying away from DWM for that very reason.  I could process the lists much like Autofocus 1, but not having used it, I wonder whether things would get accomplished in a timely manner.</div>

<div class="content">Projects can be handled a few ways.<br><br>I use a single notebook and the beginning has a page for each distinct project so I have the ability to scan a page and get the status.  My projects do not require project management software, so I am able to do this.  I am always hesitant to stray from a single notebook, but some people I work with use a separate notebook for each project.  I also wrote up a system called project focus which was a way to the AF way of processing things for projects, I think the article is on my blog.  <br><br>These are big projects, so you could also use DO IT which is specifically designed to handle three goals.  If you are interested, I would be happy to send you a copy for free if you report your progress after using it.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">@Ryan<br><br>I don't process the tasks in my notebook strictly according to AF or DWM rules. <br><br>The right hand 'must do' page for each day is like a calendar, DIT list, and daily focus list. It's for stuff I really need to get done today<br><br>The left hand 'may do' page for each day is like a quasi AF/DITW (do it this week) list :-) I can work on it ahead of time like DWM or in the past like AF, but I'm pretty flexible in how I choose.<br><br>As an example my PC got a virus yesterday, so on the 'must do' (right hand) page for today was a task to restore the backup. I also decided to try a different antivirus so put this task on the 'may do' (left hand) page for this Thursday as it's not so urgent and can wait a few days.<br><br>As it happened I changed antivirus this evening anyway so ticked it off early. But if I'd left it I'd get a timely reminder in a few days time.<br><br>Something else I find useful is when a page is 'closed out' with no tasks remaining, I fold or clip the corner. Then it's easy to see which pages are still open with tasks to do, but there's some incentive to get those pages closed out and their corners folded.</div>
