<div class="content">Mark used to write that he spent most of his time at the end of the list. At the time I read that, I thought it was odd, because the way I use the system it forced me to cycle continuously through all of the active pages.<br><br>But over the last weeks I've noticed that I've been spending most of my time at the end of the list too. This is happening because, generally, I have very few active pages. At the moment, I have one active page in addition to the last page. When there are only 3 or 4 active pages, it's easy to spend most of one's time near the end of the list, because EVERYTHING is near the end of the list.<br><br>I've been asking myself why I have so few active pages. Perhaps it's because I've had to travel one week in January, one week in February, and I will be leaving for another business trip this Sunday. Maybe my subconscious is telling me not to overcommit during a period in which my discretionary time will be minimal. Or maybe it has nothing to do with travel; it's just the way I've adapted to AF.<br><br>I think that AF accomplishes one of the DIT principles in a way that is superior to DIT. With AF, if I take on stuff at a more rapid rate than I do stuff, it becomes very obvious very quickly. I like very much Mark's suggestion that I make at least one cycle through all the active pages each day. If I can't make that cycle, I get very anxious. And that will make me think twice, or thrice, or more, before I add another item to the end of my list.</div>

<div class="content">Moises, I have 23 active pages now in my home book and 4 in my work book.  There's no way I could get through all of my home pages in a normal weekday because I don't have a lot of free time.  I'm spending my weekdays on the last page or two and I think it will work oiut that I'll be starting from the beginning again on the weekend.   If I didn't cycle through those pages once a week, I would probably be too anxious too.<br><br>If you're limiting what you put in, is that following the instructions?  I thought Mark said to throw everything at it - including the kitchen sink - which I did - and even shone the darn thing last night.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>I agree with you. I don't consciously limit what I put on the list. I am not really sure why my number of active pages has gotten smaller.</div>

<div class="content">It does seem like a very small number of pages doesn't it?  I only have 4 here at work because I just started this job on Jan. 5.  I'm hoping that thanks to AF, I'll never have more than ~5 active pages for this job, which means I'll be keeping up with the job and not getting backlogged.  Maybe you just don't have a backlog?  <br><br>On Feb. 18, Mark F. indicated that he had 14 active pages.  That seems like a pretty good, manageable number for a whole work+home list.  <br><br>Maybe some of what I have on mine are things which are routine for you.  You may have more encompassing items (clean house vs. my 70 items relating to a clean house).  Maybe you're ruthless in only entering the very next steps in projects?<br><br>Or maybe it's time to identify some new goals?  Maybe some you can do while traveling?  :-)</div>
