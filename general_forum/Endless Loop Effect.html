<div class="content">I'm using the new revised AF rules.  Just had an interesting experience.<br><br>I was in Reverse Mode (been in that mode all day!).  I came to "Change to Forward Mode", and it felt ready to be done.  So I switched.<br><br>Came to first page, where I have some goodies on notice.  One of them happened to have been already completed awhile ago (perhaps a duplicate?), so I crossed it off.  Nothing else on that page felt ready to be done.  <br><br>So I moved to the next active page.  But nothing on that page appealed to me, i.e., nothing felt ready to be done.  So, I switched back to Reverse Mode.<br><br>Back in Reverse Mode, the first thing that felt ready to be done, was to switch back to Forward Mode.  I just felt there must be some things at the beginning that needed to be done.  Some of those things are months old (using my old, original AF1 notebook), and were prime for dismissal under the AF1 method.  <br><br>But I came to my first active page, where my on-notice items are.  But none of them are ready to be done. Probably never will be.  So, back to Reverse Mode.<br><br>Again, Forward Mode stood out.  Something there was calling me.  Perhaps I just need to get used to how the new dismissal/review works.  So, back to Forward Mode, and the First Page.   Those items were still no more appealing than earlier, so back to Reverse Mode.<br><br>Finally, I had some sense beaten into me, and realized Forward Mode was going nowhere, so it didn't feel ready to be done anymore.  And I moved on.  And now it occurs to me that I should add "Purge List / go mark a whole bunch of items for review" as a new task, so my list will be cleaner.  I was just hoping the system itself would take care of that.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">"Purge List" is a task i do once in a while. Sometimes some tasks, even in the middle of my list, are not ripe for doing. They are important, but in no way urgent and now it is not the right time to do them (maybe in winter). So i highlight them for "review". Love that change of terms. They are not dismissed, they are just marked for review. I do not see a good reason why i should wait until the system would put them on review, when i know now, that i will not do them in the near future. Or are there any good reasons? Mark, maybe you have some?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, coincidentally I found myself doing the same thing with my "mature list" last night.  I'm wondering now if I shouldn't consolidate somehow rather than purge? (My stuff isn't as old, so it's a bit different situation than yours.)  I was keeping those old tasks on there in case I needed them as backup for on-notice dismissal whereas I used to pre-dismiss fairly regularly with AF1.  That feels like gaming the system though.  Mark (and others) started with a fresh list and it seems the dynamics of the switching process can change a lot with a more mature list.</div>

<div class="content">Disregard my previous post, I had another look at my book and realize I want *more* items up for notice rather than less.  I have a lot of solitary one task groups that will be up for notice, and I wish I had more!<br><br>I think doing this combined system is going to change the way I phrase my tasks, they're going to get less granular rather than broken down as I have been doing working with AF1.</div>

<div class="content">Deleting tasks from the list because you have decided, for whatever reason, that you are not going to do them at all is always acceptable.</div>

<div class="content">Mark wrote:<br><br>> Deleting tasks from the list because you have decided, for whatever reason, that you are not going to do them at all is always acceptable.<br><br>Interesting and important - I think having such tasks hanging around in the list can make a deadweight that creates resistance to working the list.<br><br>But I don't remember seeing this stated before. Don't the rules as they currently exist specifically rule out this sort of task-removal? According to the rules, tasks are removed only after being done or because they belong to a page where nothing stands out for action. So they can hang around for a long time.</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>Yes, you're right. It doesn't say this in the rules. It's just a commonsense thing really. There's a difference between tasks that are put on review - which you did intend to do and still think you might or ought to - and tasks which you have definitely decided you are not going to do at all - at least for the foreseeable future. <br><br>An example of this is my recent blog post about making choices, in which you enter the possible choices, action one and delete the others.</div>

<div class="content">Mr. Forster,<br><br>I think it's the fact you don't (nor ask us to) abandon "common sense" that is one of AF's strong suits. Other*systems seem to try to have rules for everything, they micromanage, which has somewhat of a paralyzing effect. Perhaps this has been said before but AF has the definite feel of being a tool that we use instead of the other way round, where the system runs *us* (ragged).<br><br>There is a humility to AF. . . and a respect for persons as decision makers. Thank you for treating us like adults!<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">I'm somewhat relieved to see that others have actually hit the "infinite loop" problem.  When I read the rules I saw that it might happen (because the forward rule allowed for it) and asked about it, but my question got lost in the aether somewhere ;-)<br><br>I addressed that issue in my own system (I think ... I've not finished testing it yet) by applying the original AF1 dismissal rule to the Forward Mode -- just before the change back to Reverse Mode.  I can't see a reason to remove it.  It seems to have worked well enough in AF1 and I can't grasp what is gained by eliminating it.  Yes, there is still the problem of dismissing things that I really don't want to dismiss, but I took a suggestion given to me by (I can't remember who now ;-( to "rescue" things from dismissal by adding them to the end of the list with a bang (!) in front.  That makes so much more sense to me, from a logical perspective and it seems to address the underlying issue:<br><br>- I put it on the list<br>- I decided it was not a someday item<br>- I did not do it when I had the chance<br>- I still think I OUGHT to do it<br>- I need to keep it on the list<br>- I need to have it in my face continually<br>- I need to be reminded of my previous procrastinating on this item<br><br>Dismissing it, rescuing it, and adding it to the end with a bang seems to accomplish all of that.  Of course, I've not tested it yet so it does remain to be seen.<br></div>

<div class="content">Maybe there should be a choice in Forward Mode when you come to a page where nothing stands out to be done.  By the current rules, you would go back to the end and back to reverse mode.  The other choice would be to dismiss the remaining items on the page and continuing in Forward Mode.  <br><br>Other than adding to (tweaking) the rules I can't see a disadvantage to this.  Mark?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-2 14:35</div>
<div class="content">Marty,<br><br>That is exactly how I planned to do it.  However, Mark's way has the virtue of providing a simple way to switch to the reverse mode.  It would be a shame to lose that feature.  So I might do the switch when nothing stands out on a page after I had done ONE task.  Or maybe switch after a page is dismissed?  I'm not sure how I'll actually do it.  It is one of those things I'll have to play with.<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-3 23:25</div>
<div class="content">I have a feeling that Mark already experimented with those different options, and, in the end, landed on the method described in RAF.<br><br>One reason I suspect this is the way the psychology of the switch back to Reverse Mode has been affecting me.  <br><br>Sometimes when I'm in Forward Mode, nothing on the page "feels ready to be done".  But it's not because the tasks on the page are unworthy of action, but more because I've recently entered some new tasks at the end of the list, and those new (perhaps urgent) tasks are beckoning me to return to Reverse Mode so I can deal with them.  <br><br>So, since nothing feels ready to be done in Forward Mode, I follow the rules and switch to Reverse Mode.  I then deal with those urgent tasks.  Eventually the "Forward Mode" task stands out, and I am back at the tasks I was examining earlier.  This time, they feel ready to be done, because none of the urgent tasks are distracting my attention.<br><br>Changing the rule to be "choose: either dismiss, or switch to Reverse Mode" just seems to slow down the system.  Maybe it's simply the fact that I now have a choice I must deal with -- and I don't want to break my "flow" and stop long enough to figure out what choice I should make.  I'd rather just follow the rules and move on.  I'm not sure why.  But it just bogs it down.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim,<br><br>Thanks for that.  You make some excellent points.  In light of them, I think I'll not be so hasty in changing that rule ... before I see how the system works.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-4 22:03</div>
<div class="content">Mark has actually addressed this somewhat in another post.  He say that it is fine to dismiss anything at any time once you have decided that it isn't going to get done.  Here is the quote from <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/850202" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/850202</a> : <br><br>"Assuming that you *are* doing it correctly, then Mel has picked up the salient fact that you have eleven items on the page which you are convinced you are not going to do for the next six days. If you *know* you are not going to do them, then delete them all completely and have done with it. This is not a matter of waiting until the items come up for review. There's no point in reviewing them since you know you are not going to do them. Delete them for good and all."<br><br>But Seraphim is right that making such a decision adds one more piece a complexity.  I agree that the simplicity of just following the rules is a distinct  advantage.</div>

<div class="content">Yup. Mark wrote that post in response to my question about this issue and he's exactly right. If I made the choice I am not going ot do them, then I have acted (albeit negatively) on that item and should cross it off. <br><br>And if in Forward mode I get to a page where I cannot do anything and still think I intend to do something, then I either need to bite the bullet and do one item or "get off the pot" so to speak and go back to reverse mode. <br><br>I really think the point of Forward Mode (and why AF1 is so revolutionary) is that it forces you to consider why you are choosing not to do an item. Having rules in place that force me to consider why I am not doing something I put on my "to-do" list has made me more productive and more accountable.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-5 0:53</div>
<div class="content">And, let's not forget, there are many ways items might become un-actionable:<br><br>1. You decide you aren't going to do them (as above).<br>2. You already *did* them (i.e. away from AF).<br>3. Someone else did them.<br>4. Circumstances have changed. No need to water the garden if the rabbits ate everything.<br>5. An item was one of mutually exclusive options, and was excluded by action on another item (i.e. Go on holiday to Rome; Go on holiday to Istanbul. . . you choose Rome, you delete Istanbul).<br><br>And there are likely others.<br><br>The point being that when an item doesn't *belong* on the AF list for any reason, it can easily (and properly) be taken off. Just deleted, without being up for review, or reviewed.<br><br>Thoughts?<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Hi veghead<br><br>That is exactly it with Forward Mode - if you try to cheat "the system" you lose that need to evaluate the item/s you are resisting.  I spend most of my time in Reverse Mode and frequently find it frustrating when I "have" to return to it from Forward Mode because I am not ready to do anything on the page, even though there are tasks i want to get to on the following pages.  However, today, for the first time I was able to work in Reverse Mode to all of those items and clear a ridiculous number of old "stuck" tasks, strangely including those I had previously resisted in Forward Mode..</div>

<div class="content">Christine, et al,<br><br>I don't know about the rest of you, but I do a weekly review on Sunday mornings.  I scan my whole list as well as examine my list of pending projects.  In that process, I "dismiss" things in droves.  I mean, why keep something on the list if my focus has changed or circumstances have made the task moot?  So I may dismiss 10% - 20% of my list on a Sunday morning ... and maybe and 10% of it back in new items.<br><br>I have heard the arguments about how these items serve to motivate and keep the list running in other ways ... but my PURPOSE in using AF is to get the items on my list done and so I don't want things there just because they might make my list work better.  If my list is not working well, I need to fix THAT by altering the processing rules, not keeping dead material there.<br><br>Just a thought.<br></div>

<div class="content">Structured procrastination was working against me, not for me, when I used RAF.  I would come to the page in forward mode and literally couldn't make myself do anything.  I don't think I made it past just doing the on-notice tasks even once in RAF and it had nothing to do with having urgent things that needed to be done at the end of the list.  Back to reverse mode where the easier stuff resided.   <br><br>Using AF1, I would think of a way that I could break down those uglier tasks to make it easier for myself but RAF gave me an out so I didn't have to do that and I took the path of least resistance.  It doesn't make sense in a way because I never just picked off the easy stuff to do in AF1.<br><br>It's demoralizing, I thought I had built up more self-discipline by now.  :-(<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>That's interesting.<br><br>Do you think the issue was that in AF1 you had to either do a task or delete all of them on a page in order to move to next page? So, the only way you could move forward was to do or delete -- else be trapped on a page.<br><br>Under AF (nee RAF), when you come to the same page in Forward Mode you're "out" is that you get kicked back into Reverse Mode. So there is a way to "move". . . you aren't trapped. Now your choices are (in FM) do one task or move back to Reverse Mode.<br><br>Is that about the size of it?<br><br>I wonder if the way things are set up now it takes the psychological pressure off to get something done, because if you don't you lose them. . . or just remain trapped on one page?<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">That's exactly right Joseph.  It doesn't make any sense, because in looking at my list, there's not a whole lot on the earliest pages that is that terrible or overwhelming to do as I'd broken things down well.  They're just things that didn't *stand out*.  <br><br>Maybe I'm not the norm though because I do not want to remain working / choosing relaxation activites on a list for every waking minute.  My goal is to come home from work, spend 1-3 hours moving forward on things that are important to me, then call it a day and relax doing whatever strikes my interest.  I don't like systems that are too complex (my filing is one drawer for tax, another for everything else and the fireplace).  I don't think RAF is particularly complex, but it's not minimalist which AF1 and AFC is.<br><br>My list did not slow to a crawl using AF1, I don't have urgent things to do that I can't get to in a day - and if I did, I'd use common sense and just do them, and I put things on the list well in advance of when they have to be done so I don't have to hop to the back to get them done.   <br><br>I've also gone back to AF condensed (slightly modified) because I want to use my down time at work to move forward my home list where I can without going to the back and scanning through a bunch of stuff that I can't do in that location.  I was by far the most productive when using that system in conjunction with AF1.<br><br>I guess I'm just lucky that AF1 came out first. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Interestingly I found exactly the same type of situation with Forward Mode - even though I have every confidence that I will do the tasks on the early pages, very few were standing out requiring me to go back to Reverse Mode.  i was annoyed because I wanted to do the items but they were not standing out. However yesterday the breakthrough came when I found myself zooming back through my pages to those "trapped pages".  By following the rules (which I thought weren't working because nothing was standing out) the items all stood out happily - but when I was in Reverse Mode.<br><br>My gut feeling is that, once I have a minimal number of pages, Forward Mode will become somewhat superfluous but we shall see......</div>

<div class="content">Who knows Christine - the way these things work never fail to surprise me.  I would have thought I'd be ecstatic at the thought of having "the Mark blessing" :-) to hop around on the list, but in the end it feels too chaotic to me.  And I would have thought you'd be killing off the backlog incrementally with the inexorable line of doom. :-)<br><br>One thing I might do though is use AF2 aka "RAF endless loop mode" once in awhile if I'm really not motivated to work on the list for more than a couple of days.  I seem to need a break from lists every once in awhile, but I'd prefer it if I didn't go full on lazy.</div>

This works so much better with erratic discretionery time - and mine is VERY erratic at present!! :-)  I'm now at less than 100 so am getting worried - I may have a "to do" list with nothing on it!!</div>
