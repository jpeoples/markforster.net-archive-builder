<div class="content">In the thread on the Seeded No-List system at<br><a href="../general_forum/Seeded No-List.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2672135</a><br>Mark wrote:<br><br>>>>What I'm getting at is that one thing I've learned by bitter experience in the past is that selecting a small number of tasks which must be done during the day can be a recipe for procrastination and a low volume of work.<<<<br><br>This has been my experience also. Except that with daily No-List FVP, while it was still there, it could be successfully overcome. Even better with 3T or 5T. <br><br>This made me think: With 5T the time-horizon of >>>selecting a small number of tasks which must be done<<< is very short, short enough to be very encouraging even. But if the time-horizon is a day, it is already too much and procrastination incurs.<br><br>Why is this so, what is the maximal profitable time-horizon for "must get done"?</div>
