<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>You have been eerily quiet over the last 2-3 weeks or so.  No blog posts since Feb. 10th, very few comments to posts on the forum.  I suspect you are busy with many things that have come due in your setup of DWM.  <br><br>At any rate, was just wondering what you are up to these days....<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Stalker laws??  Norman, you are full of it.  I was just asking how things are going.  Jeez...<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David<br><br>Give Mark a break.  He's retired.  He has other interests.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-03-5 21:05</div>
<div class="content">Okay -- sorry folks.  I was just interested in what he might be doing.  How about you give ME a break and not jump on me for a simple query to him?  I did not realize you were members of his own personal guard.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe we can avoid anymore unpleasantness by sending such personal queries to Mark's email address listed on the Contact tab of the website.</div>

<div class="content">Good suggestion, Brian.  I was just thinking that others also might be interested and if Mark responded, then all would see.  But I certainly won't post any questions to Mark here again....not if Norman U is going to insinuate that I am a stalker.  Jeez....<br><br>Thanks for the good suggestion, Brian.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I would have thought it less intrusive to post here. Mark will only see it when feels like checking  the forum.<br><br>Stalking his mail account would be something altogether different. <br><br>Though I do happen to have $52m that I need to get out of the country and can afford a 10% admin fee if someone will just drop a few grand into a bank account to get it moving. Perhaps Mark is the man to help with this win-win?</div>

<div class="content">Sorry for the silence, guys. I've been in Nigeria collecting my £52m. Now I need to move it to the US. Can anyone help?</div>

<div class="content">Glad to hear from you Mark.  Sorry I cannot help you move your wonderful financial gains......however, I do have some land and buildings that you may be interested in investing in....just send me about a quarter of the total amount and I promise your returns on investment will be a wonderful surprise....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Don't listen to David, Mark. I have a bridge in Brooklyn I can sell you that will give you a much greater return.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mary</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-03-6 5:44</div>
<div class="content">Now Mike, <br>Brooklyn really how passe.   I hear the next bridge, next to the AMBASSADOR bridge between Detroit and Windsor is the key investment-- Why with international borders, private ownership, public ownership and a state dept of transportion so confused that it is fit to be tied all in one deal, there sure to be success!  lol  Perhaps even as much as the bail outs...</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-03-6 12:31</div>
<div class="content">Can I go straight to the bail-out without the annoying bridge-buying bit?</div>

<div class="content">Depends on how bad a business person you are.  If you can show you are inept, have lost billions, and have hurt investors ... you're golden.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Well, Peter, my post that started this thread really was sincere and I was just trying to see what Mark was doing with DWM.  But this is okay....people here have a good sense of humor and are just having fun.  <br><br>Of course, Mark did not answer me and that is fine.  If I was not interested, I would not have asked.....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I know if I was Mark, I would get tired of all this productivity stuff at least every once in a while. Sometimes it's good to take a break and start the mind anew.</div>

<div class="content">Besides being retired, Mark may have another reason for silence:<br>His position as ' guru' means his comments carry a lot of influence. Sometimes that influence is undesirable.  It can stifle independent thought and encourage ideas to develop in the way Mark sees fit. In his ostensible absence, comments and discussion can flow in a more natural direction and we get the Bazaar effect - more input and better output as a result.</div>
