<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-12-21 22:07</div>
<div class="content">Sadly, the second very interesting conversation (in almost as many days) has been cut short because some seem to have trouble with thoughtful debate.  It seems that there needs to be a place where people can feel free to hold civil discourse with each other with no fear of being shouted down.<br><br>I have just created such a place and ALL are welcome to join in the (I hope) fun.  Civility is the only rule so far.  The group is currently unmoderated and will stay that way until the spam starts.  (Such is life, I'm afraid.)<br><br>And, just so you know, I am NOT stalking off in a huff, slamming the door behind me, bidding all a farewell, composing a death poem, or any of that ;-)  This is simply an alternative venue for serious unrestricted discourse.   If you wan to talk philosophy, religion, or any of the other taboo topics (even breakfast cereal) check out:<br><br>Group Email Addresses:<br><br>Post message: 	Philosophical_Ideas@yahoogroups.com<br>Subscribe: 	Philosophical_Ideas-subscribe@yahoogroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: 	Philosophical_Ideas-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br>List owner: 	Philosophical_Ideas-owner@yahoogroups.com<br><br>P.S.  Please forgive the pompous name for the group ... it was the best I could come up with on the spur of the moment ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I'd just like to make a response to Mike's post above. The reason I cut short the two conversations to which he refers was not because I (or anyone else) has trouble with thoughtful debate but because the conversations had become completely off topic. I don't mean off-topic for the thread, but off-topic for the website as a whole.<br><br>This website and blog are about time management and personal organization. I don't inflict my views on other subjects (and I have plenty!) on the readers of this website, and I don't intend to let other subjects take over the discussion completely either. I've always been fairly relaxed about off-topic posts, but there are limits.<br><br>I have by the way taken up Mike's invitation and joined his group.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thank you for exposing a MAJOR oversight in my post above.  I did not intend to imply any criticism directed in your direction.  This is for two reasons (at least):<br><br>1) This is your website and I acknowledge your absolute right to do whatever you want with it, and<br><br>2) It was not you who raised the objections ... your posts to that thread were interesting and well reasoned.<br><br>So please accept my apology for not clarifying my position.  In both cases I understood why you took the action you did.<br><br>Thanks for joining the new group.  I do hope people take advantage of the unstructured environment.  Since there is no focus to the group, nothing can be off topic.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I must be really thick because I can't find it to register.  Can you link to it for me Mike?<br><br>Even at the early-retirement forum, they steer clear of talk about politics and breakfast cereal.  They go off topic ALOT, but it's the most hilarious forum I've seen.  But then again, they have about 20 very active moderators too.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting discussion ends where civility begins. Mike, you would do yourself a favor to find an honest environment to post the OT stuff you do here.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark, for clarifying what this website is supposed to be about.  I will remain and contribute to discussions pertinent to the topics of the site.  Mike, I wish you all the best in your new site.  There you and others can wax away at the philosophical issues of the day and past ages.  Enjoy!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Yahoo takes some time to get groups into the index.  You can subscribe by email as noted above.  The direct link to the group is:  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Philosophical_Ideas/" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Philosophical_Ideas/</a></div>

<div class="content">Oh, and Mike....I hope you continue to contribute to the topics here as well.  It is obvious you are an engaging and bright fellow.  As for me and thoughtful debate....I am a full professor of microbiology at a major research university in the USA and a specialist in infectious diseases.  I have been engaged in thoughtful debate in the science world for many years.  I certainly am willing to discuss things....where they should be discussed.  <br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Good idea - having to scroll through endless pages of text which, although interesting, can get bogged down.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>Thanks for the good wishes and backatcha ;-)  I'm not going anywhere (well, a road trip, but I'll be as active here as ever).  I hope that in addition to being a place where off-topic things can be discussed, it will take some pressure off of this group.  Please come join us over there. Seraphim has just taken up the gauntlet I threw down on the nature of Truth (capital T).  I may be absent for a day or two at a time over the next few weeks but with Mel, Jacqueline (and her breakfast cereal metaphors), and Seraphim ... the place is in great hands.  ;-)</div>
