<div class="content">I'd love your thoughts on how best to implement AF to processing a large number of pieces of written material for a research writing project. I currently have a list of all of the pieces I'm working with (give or take a few pieces) in a database (Bookends), and I have the physical papers (if they are books I just have a sheet with the author, date, title written on it). So, that's the physical materials, and a digital list. Now, do I make a hand written list of all of these materials in my AF journal and start working through them, and "let the system sort out" the various complications, like whether I'm noting the piece, reading it, reviewing it, etc.? Or do I pick up the pile of 100+ pieces and flip through them (physically), or do I work from the database representation of the pieces? I'd love it if folks who are writers or researchers could share their workflow techniques using AF with me. Thanx.</div>

<div class="content">Steven,<br>Here is my setup in a nutshell:<br>A written AF journal for tasks and a software program (ToDoList) to plan and track projects. The link from ToDoList to AF is to write the leading tasks for the projects in the AF journal. I use Zotero to track bibliographic information and sources, which I think is comparable to to the Mac's Bookends. <br><br>Some people include all the tasks of a project in AF. For me, that works fine if its a simple and straightforward project where each step is clearly defined. However researching and writing a topic is a complex project which is nonlinear and itself contains multiple projects. For a complex project I prefer to see all of the project's tasks together at a glance. That way I get a better idea of where I'm at and where the project is going, which is critical for research and writing. So that is why I use an outliner, ToDoList, to track the project tasks. <br><br>Since you already have all the sources, maybe I'll just start there. I treat scanning and reading as distinct phases. "Scanning" is a single task, such as "scan available sources on hermeneutics." In writing in the AF journal, its shortened to "sk herm" (sk=skim). It doesn't matter how many sources I have to scan; writing down each individual source is akin to writing down "do first problem, math lesson 50" followed by "do second problem, math lesson 50." Just writing "do 1-30 lesson 50" is sufficient. <br><br>After scanning a source, which should take less than 5 minutes each, I use the tagging feature in Zotero to rate each one according to the purpose of the project. Then I copy the titles/author for well rated sources into ToDoList. If the reading for the source is short, its just a task. If I need to read the whole book, then its a simple project, with the chapters serving as the tasks. At some point after scanning, rating, and building the project tasks, I then write leading tasks into the AF journal.<br><br>I treat the other aspects of the project the same way: "Consider" or "Think" is written "consider herm" which points me to the list in ToDoList of what to consider. Same thing with "write herm." <br></div>

<div class="content">I am doing something much simple than the above. Pretty much following AF to the letter. I will let you know in a few months how things pan out.<br><br>FWIW: If you are using OS X, Scrivener is a great drafting tool.</div>

<div class="content">Thanx for the replies. After reading the replies I think I'm going to try to pare down the list of sources for this particular chapter I'm working on. Right now I've got over 100 sources! I guess AF can handle this, and whatever isn't essential will get weeded out along the way. One of the things that has helped me is the reverse AF, starting on the last page and working in reverse. Scrivener is a great little program, but I'm thinking of doing most of my drafting in DevonThink. I like the option of editing in my word processor. Scrivener is very cool too. Anyhow, I'll post an update once I get rolling. I think part of it is to let AF take care of some of the sorting. I'm finding the incremental method and working with the nonrational feeling or opening helpful so far.</div>
