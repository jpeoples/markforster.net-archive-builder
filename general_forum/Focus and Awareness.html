<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-03-7 13:30</div>
<div class="content">In the "It's been a month" thread, Mike wrote an extensive treatise.  I've selected salient bits for discussion<br><br>"""The problem is ME, not the iPhone or the app. I'll enter one context (like sleep, for example) then the next time I think about it (I realize that I'm watching TV or doing housework, for example) I'll click Eternity and see that I've been sleeping for 37 hours! WTF? It is not so much that I need to know where I spend my time, that is going to be very helpful, of course, but that I am not AWARE.<br><br>I'm not willing to give up on Eternity. I have to draw a line somewhere and being AWARE of my context ... really that I am CHANGING contexts ...is so basic to TM that to fail at that simple thing is unacceptable.<br><br>I look at it this way: before you can change anything, you have to be aware of where you are, where you want to go, and what steps need to be taken ... then monitor how well you are doing. That is pretty basic change theory, right? All control is a negative feedback loop. Simple operations research stuff. So if I can't get past knowing when I am changing context, how am I EVER going to be able to affect ANY other change? It is like the pilot not being aware he is going off course because he does not think to look at the compass. I don't do that when I fly. I don't do that when I drive. How can I accept that situation and give up on recording the context switches everywhere else in my life? That is the very name of my whole issue with TM in the first place.<br>"""</div>

<div class="content">My response:<br><br><br>Interesting Mike.  Sounds like a job for lifehack.com to solve.  It seems you only need to develop one habit, somehow, although I can imagine there's more to the problem.  On the hack side:<br><br>One thing I tried successfully was to set my watch on repeating countdown timer.  Every 30 minutes the watch would beep and I'd think, "why's that beeping?"  "To remind me to be aware of context."  And then I thought, "What am I doing now?", and recorded that in Dave Seah's Emergent Task Timer.<br><br>Other suggestions:<br>Suppose every time you turned your iPhone on you saw your current context.  Maybe tape "what are you doing?" to your phone as a perpetual reminder :-). Or embed this question in your Todo list (make it the title of your list) assuming you have an established Todo list habit.   Or suppose a timer was built into ToodleDo so that selecting a task starts a timer and leaving the task to look at other tasks stops a timer.  <br><br>As a chess player, I've become aware of the difficulty of managing my own focus there.  One challenge I've not mastered is to be aware of my opponent's plans.  It's too easy to get caught up in thinking I'm going to do this and this and that, completely forgetting what my opponent has some ideas as well.  <br><br>Point is, it's very hard to think two things at once, and doing such makes the task much more difficult.  I'm not sure how well people can master such though I think it's worth the effort.  Possibly the only good way is to develop one of the two things into an automatic habit, somehow.<br><br>If anyone has good answers, please share.</div>

<div class="content">I wrote on this very topic this morning on a thread initiated by Norman. At the time, I was unaware that Mike was also writing about this.<br><br>The first time I faced the issues we are discussing here was when I read the DIT book and tried to implement it. I struggled with the habit of writing something down before I did it. <br><br>That meant it was OK to surf the web as a displacement activity for grading papers, as long as I first wrote it down before I did it.<br><br>This is hard. It's a burden. But it bring me back to my list again and again. It forces me to confront all the things that I've deemed important that my brain has chosen--in the heat of the moment--to forget. <br><br>This, for me, was the problem with most of the AFs. It was just too awkward to shift quickly from one thing to another. With DWM, I can do whatever I want whenever I want to. There is enormous freedom. There is only one caveat: first write it down.<br><br>And that brings the mindfulness, or awareness, or whatever you want to call it. That is the habit that I want to cultivate because that is the habit that gives me efficiency, balance, and self-actualization. While the payoff is high, it takes extraordinary discipline.</div>

<div class="content">I've worked on developing the habit of timing everything I do via the iPhone to evaluate my TM. Honestly, I HATED it. I was constantly reminding myself to record what I was doing and I thought WHY? So I can see in statistical form what I already know is true? I don't just want to be more productive; I want to enjoy my life. Constantly timing and recording is not enjoyable for me, but to each his own.</div>

<div class="content">Alan Baljeu wrote:<br><<<I don't follow how DWM differs from AF* in this regard. >>><br><br>Not sure which regard you mean.  But if you mean the "freedom" that Moises mentions, I think the two systems really are different.  <br><br>With AF, you always had to be careful of triggering a particular rule if you "jumped around" or moved very quickly through your list.  For example, AF1.  If you REALLY NEED to get to page 10, but you are on page 1, and there aren't any dismissed pages, then you're basically stuck doing "something" on at least 1 task on every page, for 9 pages, before you finally get to page 10.  You can always invoke the "if you MUST do it NOW, then JUST DO IT" rule, but I tried to avoid doing that -- if you do it too often it becomes a habit and the rules tended to lose the force of their effect.<br><br>With AF4, it wasn't quite so bad, but still, if you were in the Closed List and needed to get to the Open List, or if you were in the Open List but really wanted to work on an item that was written earlier in the Open List, then you had to make sure you completed at least one task in the Closed List before you could jump to the beginning of the Open List.  <br><br>With DWM it really doesn't matter at all.  If I really feel the need to jump ahead to my Today+30 page and do the task I just wrote down there a second ago, I can go ahead and do that, and it doesn't trigger any rules that I have to remember to apply.</div>

So jumping around isn't recommended (from Mark anyway). Or am I missing something?</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>You are right.  However, Mark has talked about "jumping forward".  Basically I got the idea that it's looking at a page (or a block of pages) very quickly and saying to oneself, "None of this is standing out."<br><br>With the AF versions, if you jump ahead, you are violating the "standing out" rule, but you also have to ignore many other mechanics of the system as well.<br><br>With DWM, you are perhaps violating the "standing out" rule, strictly speaking, but doing so does not affect the other mechanics of the system.</div>

<div class="content">moises,<br><br>One comment that intrigued me was your description of DWM: "With DWM, I can do whatever I want whenever I want to. There is enormous freedom. There is only one caveat: first write it down".<br><br>This sounds to me to be a LOT like GTD.  I know you and I come from GTD backgrounds. I still embrace most of the GTD concepts.  So in my mind, one can use a lot of GTD -- even some context lists if one would like -- and also practice DWM by assigning expiration dates.  That way, tasks on the action lists would not stay there forever.....if not acted upon within 30 days....they expire.<br><br>Your thoughts on this, moises?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>I certainly can't speak for Avrum, but it does seem as if he wants what I do with respect to "measuring" time use.  I don't really want to account for every second ... OTOH, I don't know WHERE the time goes sometimes.  In my case it is the ADD thing ... I can easily get lost in tasks  when I don't focus well and am distracted, or when I'm in hyperfocus mode and lose track of time that way.  So it is important to me to get an overall sense of where I'm spending time.<br><br>But what I was really attempting to convey was that it is not even so much that I don't "measure" time, but that I'm not consciously aware of my context shifts.  THAT is the problem.<br><br>The advice Alan gave did work in the past more than it does now.  I used to have the Lakein question on the front of my TM control book.  I saw it all the time and that made me think about what I was doing.  Now I'm not so much running from a book.  I'll more get lost in projects.<br><br>So no, I don't get a kick out of knowing where each minute goes either,  I just believe that until I am more "aware" of what I'm doing I can't begin to control my time use the way I want to.  And back to Avrum ... that has been a term he has been using, IIRC ... "awareness".<br>Now that I'm thinking more about it, that might be where I should put my focus.  I've gotten very lax in my mediation practice lately ... rather than look for a "life hack", I should perhaps get back to basics.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>It really is much more Forster than Allen. Mark's DIT book (I really need to review it yet again) stressed the importance of writing things "below the line," before doing them. That is much closer to what I am talking about than Allen's "get it all out of your head."<br><br>Despite Allen's frequent invocations of martial arts and "mind like water," there was very little in GTD to promote the moment-to-moment self-awareness or mindfulness that is so much a part of Mark's systems. <br><br>I remember reading Allen describing how he'll look at his lists, and then, satisfied that everything is under control, go tend his roses--an action not on his list. As I understand Mark's system, I would look at my lists, and then get the idea to tend my roses, then put that on my list, and then do it.<br><br>So, yes, they both tell me to get stuff "out of my head." But the reality for me was that I could go a week on GTD and check off two items in the entire time. I can't go an hour on DWM without checking things off. I didn't visit this forum until I put it on my list.<br><br>Mark forces me to examine myself whenever I am about to start something new.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-03-8 16:13</div>
<div class="content">One of the differences between GTD and DWM is made clear by contrasting how they deal with recurrent tasks. DIT had a good system for. I always found recurrent tasks to be the bugbear for the AFs. DWM handles it quite well. <br><br>GTD really had no place for recurrent tasks. Allen talked a lot about checklists and the like, but they were outside of the GTD system.<br><br>Yet, I spend a decent amount of time doing the recurrent stuff each day. Why is it in Mark's system and not GTD? Because Mark's system is forcing me to remain conscious as I shift from one goal-directed activity to the next and David Allen does not.</div>

<div class="content">Hi moises,<br><br>Thanks for sharing your thoughts -- I greatly appreciate it.  You certainly make some very good points.  As I said in my other thread, with my bad idea of a new time management approach, I need to really, really pick a horse and ride it.  I know I like to do things in paper notebooks.  So I will seriously consider DWM again (and ride the horse!) and see how things go.  You and others on here who have embraced and found DWM to work so well for you provide very compelling arguments for the system.<br><br>Thanks again for your insights -- best wishes!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>I know....and for various reasons.  I did say I was only going to consider it.  I am sure you and all others have recognized that I give up on things too easily and dismiss approaches that do not work well for me very quickly.  That is a HUGE problem -- I have little patience with things.  It mainly results from the intense pressure of my work....and yes, I have no one else to blaim but myself.  I am my own worst enemy.<br><br>Actually, a fascinating irony in my behavior is that I do not display this character flaw in my research.

<div class="content">David what if you asked yourself what you need? When you are maxing out in your research, it's no wonder you need a break. When I start looking for iPhone productivity apps, I ask myself what I need and usually I am lonely, needing a challenge, or anything exciting. Rather than waste time and $ on apps, I can do something more rewarding. Strange as it may be, people with workloads like yours get bored easily. What besides playing with DWM can you do at those times? I have challenged Mike to complete a procrastinated task this week. That motivates me. Would something like that work for you? BTW I am waiting for my video footage to load so it makes it a good time to post. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>I think one thing I am looking again at is the runway effect of having all of my tasks coming towards me.  I think it will help me pare down some responsibilities -- giving me hard proof that I cannot do it all, no matter how much I seem to fool myself in thinking I can.  I am not sure I can get the same feeling with AF.  I can see the lists grow, but the pressures are much less.  <br><br>At any rate, these are my thoughts on this.  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel,,<br><br>Well, I really hope that I am not just playing with DWM, but using it as desribed in my post to Alan.  Maybe it will convince me that I need to shed some responsibilites.  As the tasks roll forward and I am uable to keep up, I may actually -- for once -- be convinved that perhaps I should strive to do a little less.<br><br>Of course, you may be right -- Maybe there is a boredom factor in there and I see trying new systems as a stimulating adventure.

Eg. have 10 choices on screen, and I click one to activate it, and the program collects stats over time.

<div class="content">About paper and awareness: At work, I could track everything electronically - and still, the only thing that reminds me of getting aware of context switches is a piece of paper (for notes) between me and the keyboard (only one sheet of paper - more would be too distracting and uncomfortable).<br><br>In my experience, I tend to ignore software because it's usually hidden by a full-screen IDE.</div>

<div class="content">I was just thinking that the only way the iPhone would REALLY benefit me with contexts is if it automatically beeped at me when I got into a context where I had to do something and it reminded me. So as I'm passing the library, I get a beep saying, "Drop off your books!" Does it do that or do I have to be IN the software and looking to see if I'm in one context or another? I am going to research that a bit. If there's an app that does this, I would only use it for those few items I'm likely to forget.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>What you want is ReQall.  I read about it in the book "Total Recal" but that is a whole 'nother story ;-)<br><br>Basically you can dictate into it, it transcribes your voice and parses what you said to product intellegent lists.  So if you say "Buy xxx" it puts the note in a "shopping" list.  If you say "Meet Joe next Tuesday" it puts it in a list of things that are coming up "soon".  If you get the subscription (you get a trial with the free version) it will use the iPhone's GPS and tell you what is near you (near is configurable).  So you can say: "Buy X at WalMart" and then if you identify where your WalMart is it will present that part of the shopping list when you are there.<br><br>Now all is not strawberries and cream.  As with most things, this is in continual development and has a way to go.  We have been screaming for a connection to Toodledo and they are "working on it".  The way you set up locations with the GPS is O.K. but could use work.  It does integrate with EverNote (the paid version) and will show you the snapshots of the wine labels when you are near  the Wal-Mart if you said: "Buy Wine at Wal-Mart.  I would really recommend that you get the Free Subscription to Evernote, and this then test the hell out of it during the trial period.  It is good enough without the subscription but for $25 or so per year, if it really does work for you it would be well worth it.<br><br>Oh, and it will also let you automatically share selected notes with people ... but it only works well if you put thier email addresses in their contacts on your iPhone.  It baffles me that they don't realize that you might want to CALL people on your PHONE ;-) ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mike. I was talking about location alerts rather than a map or context list. So if I get close to the dry cleaners I would get an alert. I found 2 possibilities. GPS todo is the best for what I need but the sound isn't working. Just the pop up. Hopefully they can get that working. Pin An Action's sound works, but it doesn't have a favorite locations tab so I would have to set the pin every time unless I want to be alerted repeatedly. Neither allows you to enter an address and both apps have to be open to work. That kind of defeats the purpose for me. If I remember to open the app when I get in the car I won't need the extra reminder when I drive by the drycleaners, kwim? To be truly useful for people like us, it should alert us automatically. Hopefully future updates will help!</div>

<div class="meta">2010-03-11 9:06</div>
<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>I'm not sure I know what you mean by "location alerts".  ReQall knows where you are because you have the store as a "place" which your task is attached to.  So when your iPhone's GPS knows you are near your "place" you see those things attached to that place.<br><br>As to it being open, yeah, I get that.  I think that will be a problem with any iPhone app just because Apple is controlling such things.  I suspect that if an application succeeds it working as you desire, it might have to be on a jail broken phone.</div>
