<div class="content">I was posting to Jacqueline quite a bit at the end of a very long thread and thought it was about time for a completely new post. :-)<br><br>How are all our AutoFocused writers doing? Using RAF or sticking with AF1 or 2? Found anything that works particularly well for your writing?<br><br>Jacqueline, I know you have read a lot of books on writing fiction and I have not. What one or two books would you say are must-reads for me? I am looking for something very practical as in, "How to Write Your First Novel." I have the NaNoWriMo book, but I'm looking for more than "just write it" obviously. Thanks in advance!<br><br>I just had a thought. I teach kids writing using a method based on the Institute for Excellence in Writing. I understand a lot of public schools use this type of approach now because it works beautifully. I am just wondering if this method wouldn't get a fiction writer off and running too. The principle is that rather than tell a child, "Write a creative story" which does little more than cause panicked convulsions and crying fits for most, you have the child read an excellent short story. You teach them methodically how to rewrite the story. In a wonderful bit of reverse psychology, you tell them all they have to do is literally copy the story changing a few defined things (e.g., they must use an -ly word, a because clause, etc.). <br><br>Time and time again I have found when I give the kids permission to just copy the story, they DON'T. They end up changing the characters and much of the plot, too. If I had asked them to do this from the get-go, it would have been a disaster. So all of this to say, I wonder if a fiction writer is stuck, if taking a section of a story they love and rewriting it and improving on it in a few ways (using a descriptive adjective, etc.) wouldn't get them into the groove of really writing their own story? I think it could very possibly take adult writers from "I can't" to "I can."</div>

<div class="content">Wow. Apparently my idea is a good one. Just reading a review of Smith's "You Can Write a Novel Kit" and it said:<br><br>Smith offers a number of valuable tips that I haven't seen in similar how-to books. One of them is to practice writing out select paragraphs of best-selling authors. In doing so, you can learn a lot about proper sentence structure, good dialogue, and powerful, action-packed sentences.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Mel, I bought the nanowrimo book by Chris Baty - No Plot, No Problem.  But here's my problem...  I don't want to write garbage, and a lot of what comes out of those short programs appears to be garbage.  <br><br>I really love Elizabeth George's book "Write Away."  She's left-brained, like me - so I can relate to her.<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Write-Away-Novelists-Approach-Fiction/dp/0060560444/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1249853566&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Write-Away-Novelists-Approach-Fiction/dp/0060560444/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1249853566&sr=8-1</a><br><br>Here's a quote from her book:<br>"Lots of people want to have written; they don't want to write. In other words, they want to see their name on the front cover of a book and their grinning picture on the back. But this is what comes at the end of a job, not at the beginning. To reach that end you have to be willing just to set it aside, knowing that it may never happen at all but not much caring because it's the writing that matters to you; it's the mystery and the magic of putting words on paper that are truly important. If you don't feel this way, then you want to be an author, not a writer."<br><br>I bought the following off of Amazon, and they're somewhere in transit right now:<br><br>Novelist's Boot Camp: 101 Ways to Take Your Book From Boring to Bestseller <br>You Can Write A Novel Kit <br>Book in a Month: The Fool-Proof System for Writing a Novel in 30 Days <br><br>I'll let you know what they're like when I get them.<br><br>I got Phyllis A. Whitney's book out of the library - Guide to Fiction Writing and it's quite practical.<br><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Guide-Fiction-Writing-Phyllis-Whitney/dp/0871161575/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249852984&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.ca/Guide-Fiction-Writing-Phyllis-Whitney/dp/0871161575/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249852984&sr=8-1</a><br><br>Here's my notes on the book (sorry if it's TMI):<br>- spend 2 months planning, 4 months writing, 2 months revision (she spends 3 hours/day, 6 days/week)<br>- section a novel notebook into:  calendar, titles, plotting, characters, outline<br><br>- Calendar - daily log; # of manuscript pages and total words to date<br>- Titles - look at quotations<br>- Plotting - add to before and as you write; items needn't be connected; use free-association with a pencil; 40-70 pages for ideas to develop painlessly<br>- Characters - names, likes/dislikes, traits/types; they will come alive when you write<br>- Outline - plan/map; break down material (from plotting section) into rough chapters; decide where and when each character is introduced; break into scenes; when outlining, don't do any writing<br><br>The premise is that when you get 50 pages of notes and sections, etc., you won't get bogged down in the middle and you won't waste a bunch of time.  After your outline and plotting sections get done, you should be just itching to actually write the thing.  When my sister and I would write novels together when we were kids they would fizzle - of course we didn't know any better.  I wish she were still here and we could write together again.  :-(<br><br>I got Dean Koontz' book "How to Write Best Selling Fiction" out of the library.  It's out of print, and I am strongly tempted to tell the library that I lost it.  It really is that good.  Even if you don't care for his style of book, he is a master of pacing and language.  Same thing with Stephen King's "On Writing" - but you get the feeling that both of these guys came out of the womb with a typewriter in their hands.  Koontz breaks the process down better.<br><br>Others I have that I would recommend:  "Scene and Structure" - Jack Bickham; Oakley Hall is similar.  Anne Lamott's "bird by bird" is a classic.  <br><br>I want to get the following:<br>- Orson Scott Card's - "Characters and Viewpoints"<br>- Renni Browne - "Self-Editing for Fiction Writers"<br>- Ann Hood - "Creating Character Emotions"<br>- Monica Wood - "Description"<br><br>I hope that gives some ideas.  I've got lots more, but I have them in boxes to get arranged  into my bookshelves.<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine, don't put "Read Mel's fiction book" on your AF list. It'll get dismissed from your review list, too. LOL <br><br>Jacqueline, 18 hours a week? If I were a full-time novelist, that would be just fine, but I'm certainly not that. I wrote my nonfiction book in a summer. Not sure I am ready for that commitment! On the other hand, I know people who have spent years writing their books. I guess I will do some reading and determine via AF if it's something I'm ready to do or not. I have an idea. Does that count? LOL I know it's a gigantic undertaking from reading friend's novels. It's very intimidating. On the other hand, a doctoral dissertation is, too, and I managed to complete that with my sanity intact (barely), so I figure I CAN do it. It's just, "Do I want to?" <br><br>I will copy this to evernote for review as I go. Thanks so much!!!</div>

<div class="content">Oh no, Mel - SHE spent 18 hours a week, but that's her JOB - I have no intention of doing that right now and you probably can't either.  I'm thinking 5 or 6 hours a week is plenty if you have an outside job and family.  Fortunately for me, later this year, I won't have a job and Marc will be in school.  P.D. James got up every morning at 6 a.m. and wrote before work for years before she quit her full-time employment.  Elizabeth George wrote her first (published) novel during her summer break from teaching high school - she said that it took her 42 days writing 8-16 hours a day.  That was a 500 page manuscript though - so pretty long.  So 320-640 hours = one to two years if you're only putting in an hour a day.   But that was also a very, very good book.<br><br>It strikes me that many successful female authors did not have children.  But lots did - I think given that you are homeschooling, who knows?  You're probably like me, and have learned to sit down with the kids while they're watching TV and read a book or do some work - they don't know the difference and you all win.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>I've done LOTS of writing.........Never did all that fancy book courses etc....If you happen to THINK visually with a strong visceral component, that won't really help anyway.  I was told that even for my art, music and higher mathematics and physics courses I think in pictures while feeling it and then I transcribe it into mathematics, art, music or words.  I'm just thinking.....if you're the same way.......just let the movie roll in your head and "feel" it.....then translate the story into words.  Your brain does most of the work.....you're simply the writing utensil.  If you're brain isn't providing you with that story, just translate what movie is going on in your brain.....many times it's playing around and fleshing out things.....in the meanwhile, you're getting good at finding the most effective words to tell it.  word smithing....Pretend that you're telling someone a story about what happened to you.....use words to make them see it, feel it.....even think in it....TAKE THEM THERE WITH YOU........cuz, in a way, that's exactly what you're doing with fiction and biographies.....  This won't work if you're not a visual/visceral thinker....(we have to transcribe our experiences into words.)  I'd imagine that being auditory would be even simpler.....cuz you think in words!   I just don't see all this forced stuff except to acclimate yourself to the process of translating slices of living into words....which we do all the time but without as much careful selection/editing.....In my culture, learning how to tell rich stories was almost as important as learning how to walk!  LOL!   <br>I'm only saying.......try to see how you relate stories naturally and work with that......Don't allow formulas to stifle your natural expression.  I guess you could force a story....even ghostwriting......I put their story to my brain and let it flesh it out......I just offered my hand to type it as it told it......and helped it along fleshing it out a bit with playing around with wordsmithing to make it more real that's all..........Maybe some authors have to grunt out their work..............writers are merely expressing something....like artists, musicians, dancers, etc......It's just another medium to express a part of you (in this case, your imagination and knowledge flowing out into words......bottom line...you can't take the reader where you haven't been.....caution: be prepare to throw away lots of it.....you are your brains hands........it percolates and fleshes things out while you learn how to be a better transcriber/wordsmith....It's like any expression..........The more devoted you are to mastery, the wider the range of your experience and expressing it.<br>Good Luck.................It's worth whatever you put into it........<br>learning</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline and learning, thanks so much. I just talked with my book-obsessed 13yo son about my idea. His peer group is my target audience and it was so fun chatting. I have asked him to be my editor. He'll be a great help. He also wants to write a book which will be a great homeschool project for him. It's really fun having a teenager so far. LOL</div>

<div class="content">Mel, I'm truly wowed by your way of teaching composition to a child (or adult). If I'd had this, I wouldn't have had so much paralysis to unlearn over the years (and still address) :). I'll have to think about it some more. <br><br>I'm curious about how you homeschool and write. I basically spent the first five years of motherhood intending to homeschool, then gave up the idea because I recognise I'm self-absorbed, easily sidetracked, struggle with erratic energy, and want time alone to study (and do my own thing). Been having quite a bit of angst about my son's first year in school though. I do also have a largely absent partner, while my homeschooling friends have involved, likeminded ones - another reason I decided against it (for now at least). Sorry to hijack - point me to another thread if you've discussed this.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>I forgot a really effective aide.  If you're collaborating with someone or simply have an interested person (Mel, your son.....or Jacq....your son  LOL)....as you write a completed session , have them read it....then have them ask you any questions about it.....Who knows what they'll ask?  It might be plot directed, it might be questions about character development, it might even be a gap in train of thought  (I sometimes tend to "assume" everybody is working with the same referencing knowledge/experiential base....writing and reading what you wrote is truly affected by this.....)  Their questions will surely launch more writing....the development might be a bit kaleidescopic, but that's OK....the more you're immersed in it, the more familiar you become with it!  LOL!  It's a wonderful way to get a reader's perspective......don't censor them.....even if they offer bits of constructive critism..........you might not agree, but you do gain something by hearing their natural reactions.....<br>I wrote an entire book by someone feeding me like this!  LOL!   When you're not writing, your brain is in the background putting it all together......it's almost like two entities are writing....you and your subconscious feeding you the story elements. ....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">tip for you AF writers.....the questions and comments they write could be your book's af list......believe me, it will launch many fruitful writing sessions. The dismissal rule can't be rigid because your subconscious has it's own time requirements.  While you're writing in response to one questions, you will get gestalt type answers to other parts of the narrative/story.....For me, at least, it's like putting together a puzzle.....actually you're creating pieces of the puzzle while also joining other completed pieces....it's actually rather exciting!  They, too, become quite involved and might offer more questions because now their brains are engaged in the developing book as well!  Now, that's an AF list I'd be willing to implement if I still had the stuff to write dependably within a timeframe!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">OMG learning!  I think you just solved my blockage!!!<br><br>At the beginning of putting the book into the AF list I would write something like "plotting - chapter 2, scene 3" - this didn't work well at all and I had to push myself all the time to do these tasks.  So I put them all into AF1 and onto one page so I couldn't move past without dismissing the whole page (and in effect saying that if I didn't do this, I would never write a book.)<br><br>Then I started to write phrases like "free write about genesis of characters X and Y misunderstanding."  That's a little better.<br><br>BUT if I write something like - "will character x admit to Y that they were wrong?" I think it will go MUCH more smoothly!  In fact, I'm thinking about it now and want to get to figuring it out!  <br><br>Instead of writing "characterization" on the list, I could write "Is her name Elena?"  "Is she a child therapist?" or "What made her become a child therapist?" or "When a child is arrested for murder, do they call in a child therapist?" and "At what age is a child considered a minor in the state of Colorado?"<br><br>Is this something like what you would do?  Thank you SO MUCH for your help!  <br>What a bizarre (and engaging) list I will have!<br></div>

<div class="content">(((Jacqueling)))<br>I'm so glad for you!  I'm not sure how your brain imagines, creates, etc.......basically, find ways to engage yourself and it's imagining process.  When I'd get stuck, I'd do just like you're saying.  I'd ask it questions, or lay still with music (background mood music for your book as a movie) , etc....what ever makes it excited to both build and tell the story.  I'm not sure about you, but having someone else feed you questions from their brain (i.e. a different perspective) sometimes jogs loose stalement and also "reminds" you that essentially you're telling a story with the hopes of transporting them there right along with you.<br>Isn't it so exciting and fun?  Even when it's hard and challenging, it's still wonderful!<br>Just don't give yourself obligatory pressure or fake contrive the direction....surely that will block your creativity as surely as a backlogged todo list will!  LOL!  Also....stay current on "safe" and "good enough" for regular stuff so when creativity strikes you'll have the freedom to go with it unobstructed and without any drag of real life distracting your brain, see?  When the inspiration strikes, just pretend that you're away on vacation and your house will "hold" until you come home!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Savitri<br>In response to your question.....YES!   I did exceedlingly well throughout school.  I was an art major/mathmetics minor yet the Dean of the university tried to get me to change my major to communications.....I hadn't even taken any literature or writing classes....it was my first semester freshman year!!!!!!!   The student body was 45,000 people and he thought it was worth his bother to call me to his office to try to get me to change my major...........When you write term papers, TRY to find an angle that's exciting to learn.  As I say....you can't take the reader where you haven't been yourself.  Your assignment isn't only to learn and create a solid paper.........it's also to get the grade.......sounds shallow.........but......best way..........get the prof excited by the experience of reading your term paper!   Reality, some courses aren't really your cup of tea......the challenge is to find an angle that actually excites you to learn it and write about it to get the prof as excited as you were.  If the subject matter is boring................look HARDER....there's always an exciting angle somewhere......if not.......create it with a new perspective!<br>Good Luck!<br>p.s.

<div class="content">Learning, I was thinking about this in relation to blog / forum posts.  I was playing around writing a blog post the other day (first one, just doing it for my own interest - b/c I think most personal finance blogs are way too boring when finance is actually really fascinating if you've found out what floats your boat) - and I realized it felt too forced.  Yet posting on here is not difficult because you're just doing a stream of consciousness thing.  In fact, I can easily write 500 words in about 3 minutes in a forum post (much to Norman's dismay) - and even if a lot of it is "dross"  - I guess that's what editing is for.  :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueling<br>Yeah, sometimes what editors consider dross is part of the necessary flavor in my opinion.......but when you're serving a larger public, that's part of the sacrifice.....*sigh*<br>Do like old fashioned reporters......start with grabbing title....then succintly summarize the facts and in some cases, it's intended purpose.  Then you can flesh it out....I'm simply guessing here because I never did any reporting or blogging.....just took journalism course...but it "seems" logically germaine , yeah?<br>As for my true opinion of the value of dross within writing.............AHEM!!!!!  I'm the High Priestess of (uneditted) Dross!  ROTFL!<br>If part of your mission is to enlighten/teach....there will be some grunt work involved organizing, researching, rewrites, etc.....but, you'll still love the process because it ultimately engages you!  <br>I really used to get p.o.'d when people said things come easy to me........hell.....I've done mountains of grunting.....but I wanted to in the service of mastery or doing well for others.

<div class="content">By the way Mel, writers have been copying out passages by other writers for centuries. It's not a new idea or new method, but something that has been tested and proven effective for a long, long time. It's a way of learning style, craft, getting inspiration, etc.<br>To give two recent examples.

<div class="content">Savitri, my mother homeschooled us until the age of 6 (she was a teacher) - just the girls - she thought boys shouldn't go to school at all until they were at least 9 y.o. :-)  We were reading Dickens and other classics by the time we were four.  (I used to devour Harlequin romances at my grandmother's house.) But she only taught us until we went to school.  Then she wanted us out of the house!  I can't blame her, there were 8 of us and nobody homeschooled back then.  All three of us girls skipped grade 1 and probably should have skipped a few more grades, but we would have been too emotionally immature, I think.   <br><br>I pulled my oldest son out of school on two extended sabbaticals / vacations (each about 2 months long) over the years, and he didn't fall behind at all.  But he's a voracious reader (and I encouraged him to read by buying him whatever comic books he wanted when he was little as he has an artist's eye as well.)  I did notice a very pronounced increase in his grades when we went from a Canadian school to an "exemplary" school down in Texas for a couple of years.  I love my kid and he's smart, but to jump from B's and a few A's to straight A's down there was surprising.  I found out why when we moved back up here and realized how far behind in math he was.  He was basically reviewing grade 7 math when he was in grade 9 - no wonder it was easy.  He had a lot of catching up to do when we came home.<br><br>I don't know that it has to be an either / or kind of choice.  If you can find a school that's willing to work with you, is it possible to skip days or weeks or maybe just supplement the regular curriculum in an "unschooling" way?    Let the school be the social outlet and the real learning takes place at home.  I'm hopeful that when we make it down to Mexico or S.A. one winter for a few months, I can enrol my son in a private school while we're down there.  <br><br>I, too am not a natural born teacher, although I imagine I could be with a child who was motivated.  Unfortunately, my youngest child isn't particularly book-oriented, but although it was hard for me to understand that, I'm slowly getting over the pain.  :-)  He'd rather be outside, ripping the neighbourhood kids off selling over-priced lemonade, so I'm hoping he'll become an entrepreneur and take care of his mom one day.  <br><br>A couple of things I did with my oldest as well (he's 21) was to cut the cable for a couple of years at a time if I thought he was watching too much TV and not reading enough.  I also bought one of those TV timers (but procrastinated about installing it - where was AF then!)  There was a time when we didn't even have peasant vision where we were living and all he had was about 10 videos to watch (unfortunately, you know how kids can watch them over and over and over...)  He also shares my love of museums and history and I put him into art classes and other kinds of educational camps in the summer when he was out of school to develop his interests.  If you cut TV out of the equation, kids will find a way to amuse themselves and that way will often lead to books.<br><br>When we went to Florida last year, we managed to endure one day of Disneyworld (we all hated it), then went to other places that were entertaining yet somewhat educational - Kennedy Space Center, Medieval Times, Key West museums... on our cruise, we stopped in Puerto Rico and did tours of the parliament buildings, the old forts and old churches and the kids had a wonderful time.  My youngest son is in Science camp at the University where I work this summer and is having a lot of fun with experiential learning.  <br><br>To sum up, I don't think you have to officially "home school" to do some homeschooling in a way that works for you and that you both enjoy.  More than anything, we should just want to give our children a love of learning, that's real success in my book.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Some good advice from Oakley Hall's "The Art and Craft of Novel Writing":<br><br>Henry Miller's Commandments:<br>1.  Work on one thing at a time until finished.<br>2.  Start no more new books, add no more new material to "Black Spring:.<br>3.  Don't be nervous.  Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is at hand.<br>4.  Work according to Program and not according to mood.  Stop at the appointed time!<br>5.  When you can't *create* you can *work*.<br>6.  Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.<br>7.  Keep human!  See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.<br>8.  Don't be a draught-horse!  Work with pleasure only.<br>9.  Discard the Program when ou feel like it - but go back to it next day.  Concentrate.  Narrow down.  Exclude.<br>10. Forget the books you want to write.  Think only of the book you are writing.<br>11. Write first and always.  Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.<br><br>Steinbeck's advice on writing:<br>"Don't start by trying to make the book chronological.  Just take a period.  Then try to remember it so clearly that you can see things: what colors and how warm or cold and how you got there.  Then try to remember people.  And then just tell what happened.  It is important to tell what people looked like, how they walked, what they wore, what they are.<br>Put it all in.  Don't try to organize it.  And put in all the details you can remember.  You will find that in a very short time things will begin to come back to you, you thought you had forgotten.  Do it for very short periods at first but kind of think you aren't doing it.<br>Don't think back over what you have done.  Don't think of literary form.  Let it get out as it wants to.  Overtell it in the matter of detail - cutting comes later.  The form will develop in the telling.  Don't make the telling follow a form."<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, awesome writing advice! And who knew about you and homeschooling? ;-) I happen to agree with you. I just shared this with a friend of mine who is torn about it. I told her to remember that homeschooling or not isn't a one-time decision either. You can do it for a while and then put them in school. They won't die. My SIL HS'd for a while in the midst of their schooling and the kids adjusted very well. I do feel like I'm a natural born teacher. Every night I sat in my bed as a child teaching an imaginary class. Why I didn't pursue teaching as a profession I don't know. Although I really had no interest in homeschooling at first, I have found that it is my passion. Writing and speaking I could leave, but not teaching my children. Part of the passion is my ability to indulge my own love of learning. I adore getting to give myself the education I never got as a child. Off to get ready to start school tomorrow. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Oh Mel, I had quite an odd childhood in many ways. :-)  <br><br>My sister homeschooled 3 of her 4 children (she was a teacher, but not very long) - the girls through high school and one of her boys in about grade 3, 9 and 12 (he was a little unmotivated - the mechanically inclined kind of kid that doesn't really fit into an academic world).  They don't have the love of reading that she and I have, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. :-)  I think much of it is due to the lack of almost any television we had growing up.  I see that in my oldest son as well, as although he enjoys TV, he continues to read daily - probably even more than I do nowadays.  That's another reason why I like taking my younger son camping out in the boonies, even he will turn to reading then.<br>Here's a good article re. kids and TV:<br><a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1650352,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1650352,00.html</a><br><br>Of those 3 books I bought, "You Can Write a Novel" (James V. Smith Jr.) is the best, definitely worth buying.  Sometimes the best writers aren't the best teachers, maybe because it comes more naturally to them, where the writer who has had to work at it has had to break the process down for themselves.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">You'll get no argument from me on the TV. I gave a talk on the dangers of it years ago. That does NOT mean however that we don't have a TV. ;-) My dh likes his TV and movies even though he is one of the most active, productive people I know. I am really cracking down on the media this year. The computer games are much more addicting for my kids now than TV. Now that we're back in school, they won't have much time for it. <br><br>By the way, it was day 1 of doing school AF-style. I can't believe what a dolt I've been. I have listened to the homeschooling "experts" who are so clearly melancholy. I have been trying to fit my sanguine self into the schedule mold for years. Normally using a schedule I can't get everything done. Today without using one at all and with gobs of questions about new curriculum, etc., I was done teaching nearly a half-hour early! Amazing! I never looked at the clock and just got the lessons done in the order I felt like doing them. I can tell that I'm not going to be hating school mid-year because I won't feel my style is being cramped.<br><br>I just got You Can Write a Novel in the mail in the midst of writing this post. I'm so excited! Thanks so much for taking the time to give me great tips and resources. That's normally what I do for people. It's nice to be on the receiving end!</div>

<div class="content">I would love to! Send away! <br><br>No, you have a good habit of loving to learn. My oldest is this way. He researches everything and unfortunately prides himself on knowing more about everything than I do. LOL I'd like a dollar for every time he starts a sentence with, "Well, actually..." LOL<br><br>I will check out the parenting book. You may recall that I have a fondness for the Sanguine/Choleric/Melancholy/Phlegmatic typology of personality. I've read a parenting book on this that helped me immensely. Most of us are Sanguine/Cholerics, but I have at least one son who is Phlegmatic like the men in my family were. I saw their inability to make decisions and I just saw it as weakness. Once I understood their personality's needs and fears, it become so easy to parent my son--even to deal with friends! I have a phlegmatic friend who when she doesn't want to or isn't able to do something with you will just say, "Yeah, maybe! Maybe I can." I think that means she really wants to do it. WRONG. I've learned that when she says that it means 'no,' but she's too afraid to tell me so. It was such a victory when my son was able to tell me he didn't want me and his youngest brother to go on a hike with him for his birthday after I'd reassured him that it made absolutely no difference to me. (It didn't). I like to think I'm preparing a better husband some day. <br><br>As for using personality to construct a character, that's brilliant! Once I first really grasped these personality constructs, I realized that psychics use this knowledge to make a mint. You can tell almost immediately what someone's bent is and then wow them by seeming to know everything about them.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Mel,<br><br>Re. the blog post on AF - I am having a hard time putting my finger on the core of what to say.<br><br>It's like you could go back and look at old forum posts (when there was only AF1) where person A is telling person B not to do something (like work backwards from the end) because it will "break the system".  Then AF2 and RAF is out - and person B will be telling person A not to keep doing AF1 because RAF is so much better.   I'm embarrassed that I was kind of inflexible too about people's mods sometimes when I'm usually more of a "do what works" / "rules don't apply to me" person.  <br><br>So I was thinking - does any of it *really* matter about direction or working front to back, hopping around - really anything BUT: <br><br>a) having the right stuff on your list<br>b) dismissing what's not relevant - whether pre- / during - or a combination thereof<br>c) working on things that stand out 95% of the time and pushing yourself a wee bit the other 5%<br>The rest is commentary.<br>Anyway, your $.02 would be appreciated. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, I understand struggling with blog posts. ;-) For some reason, I can post here and blab for hours, but when it comes time to blog post I am often stymied.<br><br>My personal opinion is that it does not matter and it also does. Here's why. It doesn't matter if someone has a system that works to make them more productive AND satisfied with that productivity level. One of the things I noticed was that despite being more productive with AF1, many weren't completely satisfied with it. Therein lies a very important factor ignored by most TM experts: belief. <br><br>As a psychologist, I could suggest that a client see a psychiatrist for a prescription that I thought would help them. But if that client was repelled by the very thought of taking a drug, any benefits to be gained will be to no avail. It's the same with TM. Even if dismissal rules have a the capacity to get you working in AF1, if the individual believes the rules hamper him, the system is going to break down and most likely s/he will stop using it. <br><br>In my practice, I explored with clients why they held the medication beliefs they did. Sometimes our discussion changed their mind. I think the tendency this board has of questioning tweaks is a very healthy one. We need to make sure that someone really, really will benefit from their tweak. Sometimes a patient no way, no how wants a drug and that belief needs to be honored. In the same way, someone who cannot abide by one or more of AF's "rules" should be honored. Most likely greater productivity and satisfaction will result.<br><br>If I'm correct, then why don't we just say to people, "Make a list and use your own rules"? Because there are basic principles of TM at work in AF that are effective for the majority. Just as we wouldn't trash a drug that cured most but had side effects for some, we don't scrap the AF rules that help so many. The second reason it matters is because so many of us have no idea where to start. I remember when I first found FLYLady. I literally did everything she did in the same order, even to the point of taking a bath at night. How ridiculous, right? No. I needed a place to start before determining what aspects didn't work for me (By the way, the bath was out immediately - lol). <br><br>In order to determine the "dose" of AF that worked for me, I needed to try the recommended dosage first. AF rules are the starting dose that most of us need. Yes, some of us are too quick to adjust our dosage. But I do believe that we'll find the right treatment for our time management woes and for the majority of us AF is the drug of choice.</div>

<div class="content">Mel, that makes sense, particularly when I consider that I was slow to adopt AF at work and abandoned it after only a couple of months.  Because I didn't *need* the rules there to get me to work on things, they were more irritating than helpful.  I don't have self-discipline issues at work.  I went back to my method I've used for years of a list of 1-7 important projects to start work on or finish for the day, and an hour or so of minimal maintenance at the end of the day.  It's only when I get a bunch of little niggling tasks to do that I find I need a grass-catcher of sorts.  The remainder, I just forget about, so they are dismissed. :-)<br><br>With the reduced time that I have with AF at home, I find I'm adopting the same strategy with my A and C books now, doing those A-task(s) right when I get home, usually working without looking at the book (there's only ~20 of them left, so I know what they are, and most of the client work I can't do at home anyway).  I just cross them off the next day.  With the C-tasks, I am still using AF because I still face resistance to doing them.  <br><br>This has always been the ultimate goal that I wanted to get to in the end - to be able to work at home like I do at work.  I never thought I'd have to take such a round-about way to get to the ideal method that I knew how to do in another arena though.<br><br>I understand the need for other people to need a system though, because they don't have one that they've had years of experience with that works.  <br><br>With the writing, I've started doing it first thing in the morning for ~ 1/2 hour and a bit at lunch - the writing in the morning and the focused imagineering at lunch.  It's working great. :-)<br></div>

Isn't it interesting how we trip ourselves up doing what we think we ought to be doing rather than what we know works for us? I am NOT saying that listening to others' approach isn't valuable. On the contrary, it can be really life changing. I feel so stupid trying to hold myself to a rigid homeschooling schedule because that's what one of the leading homeschooling gurus says to do. I really respect this woman, but she is also one who teaches from textbooks. Eek! I think I have unwittingly confounded the greatest assets I bring to homeschooling by trying to fit into her mold. You're a goal setter. I think that's so awesome. Do what works for you!!</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br>I loved the quotations from Henry Miller and John Steinbeck.  Are both of those quotations in the book by Oakley Hall which you mention?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve, yes they are - they're in the Chapter called "Planning" (Steinbeck) and "Beginning" (Miller) - close to the end of the book.  <br><br>It is a very good book overall because he's not restrictive in recommendations, more of a "this writer does this, this one does the opposite, I do this, they all can work, do what works for you."  He has a quote from Kipling in the book:<br><br>There are nine-and-sixty ways of constructing tribal lays <br>And every single one of them is right.<br><br>Here's a couple of good interviews with authors on a site I haven't seen before (Academy of Achievement, Museum of Living History).  I hope it's helpful to someone:<br><br><a href="http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/tan0int-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/tan0int-1</a><br><a href="http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/mcc1int-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/mcc1int-1</a><br><br>Here's the main page for their essays on the keys to success.

<div class="content">Steven Pressfield's "the War of Art" has some great advice on overcoming the blocks to writing or any other endeavour that you're passionate about (or even just wanting to achieve), yet afraid of pursuing.   <br><br><a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=whvYxmkxwB0C&dq=steven+pressfield+war+of+art&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=d3x8taNAm3&sig=OE2upkljdcplQNK9Ga4U60izS50&hl=en&ei=w6eWSpTYO43GMJXV5IkD&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.ca/books?id=whvYxmkxwB0C&dq=steven+pressfield+war+of+art&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=d3x8taNAm3&sig=OE2upkljdcplQNK9Ga4U60izS50&hl=en&ei=w6eWSpTYO43GMJXV5IkD&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false</a><br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251386657&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251386657&sr=8-1</a><br><br>Here's an interview that I also found helpful where he discusses self-doubt and clarity and the war of internal forces within us:<br><a href="http://www.audiomotivation.com/go/steven-pressfield105.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.audiomotivation.com/go/steven-pressfield105.htm</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Here's a link to Dr. Wicked's "Write or Die" app:<br><br><a href="http://lab.drwicked.com/writeordie.html" rel="nofollow">http://lab.drwicked.com/writeordie.html</a><br><br>"Write or Die is a web application that encourages writing by punishing the tendency to avoid writing. Start typing in the box. As long as you keep typing, you're fine, but once you stop typing, you have a grace period of a certain number of seconds and then there are consequences."<br><br>It doesn't give you a lot of time to think, and it's helpful to have a vague idea of what you want to write before you sit down and use it.</div>
