<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-24 8:39</div>
<div class="content">Google alerts popped up this new link: <a href="http://www.priacta.com/troblog/2009/08/21/training/review-mark-forsters-autofocus-vs-tro/" rel="nofollow">http://www.priacta.com/troblog/2009/08/21/training/review-mark-forsters-autofocus-vs-tro/</a><br><br>It's a short review of Autofocus by Kevin Crenshaw, Priacta Head Coach and co-author of The TRO Field Guide. TRO appears to be this company's online TRO time management training ("Total, Relaxed Organization"), which uses elements from GTD and Mark's systems.<br><br>They list of some advantages and disadvantages from their perspective, drawing a conclusion that it's easy to learn and most appropriate for those with few and non-critical tasks (is that anybody?!). They then unsurprisingly suggest trying their own system instead....<br><br>I think they've scanned the instructions and come to their conclusions without trying it themselves. The extensive feedback on this forum shows that RAF can support the needs to a wide variety of people and handle heavy and time-sensitive workloads.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Jonathan<br></div>

<div class="content">Jonathan,<br><br>Good find. And smart to set up a Google Alert regarding Autofocus.<br><br>Let's use this thread to dissect the article! I'll start:<br><br><<No Focus on Next Actions. David Allen (GTD) focuses on the “single next action” for each project. Mark’s “Autofocus” lacks this, though it could be added by writing your tasks in “Project – Next step” format. You need this to overcome resistance to larger projects.>><br><br>It seems to me that the fact AF encourages "little and often" through the mechanism that *any* action on an item is enough to cross off the item and re-enter it at the end of the list is exactly the same as GTD's "next actions". <br><br>But, instead of having to think through what the next action is and enter it into a list, AF lets you decide what the next action is when you are doing something with the item. This solves the perennial problem that GTD'ers try to solve --> how do they link their next actions to their projects? In AF, instead of spending resources in figuring out all the next actions before you do them, you figure out the next action when you *are* doing.<br><br>The idea that next actions are useful in tackling a large project has merit. But once you internalize that, whenever you see a large project you think to yourself "what is the next action?" and do it. After all, isn't that what you do when you write down the next action in GTD (except that you might defer doing the next action until later)?<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">It's hard to take this review seriously when they're pushing their own software & time management system. <br><br>I never understood the "mind like water" nonsense that GTD'ers throw around particularly when discuss "next actions". Perhaps I'm just lucky. But when I walk into the kitchen, my brain does a decent job of deciding what to do next. I've yet to experience a scenario like this:<br><br>Step a: feel hungry<br>Step b: walk into kitchen<br>Step c: stand in kitchen, ponder next action to curb hunger<br>Step d: still standing<br>Step e: still hungry<br>Step f: remove my pants and relieve myself on the floor of my kitchen<br>Step g: remind myself to place a "next action" next to Project: Eat to avoid soiling my floor</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for drawing my attention to this, Jonathan. What they reviewed was the first version of Autofocus, so I have commented on their site to draw their attention (and their readers') to Revised Autofocus.</div>

<div class="content">Mark. thanks for your comment/reply on our blog. That article was released two weeks late for technical reasons, so I'm taking a look at Revised Autofocus. I'll not reply to the revisions yet because I don't want to do a superficial assessment. I gained some good insights from you in the past and I don't want to miss anything! :-)<br><br>I agree with Avrum to a point. "Mind like water" is easily taken too far. I can't be "intuitive" staring at a list of 200 unordered items (basic GTD). We solve that by adding the right kind of dates to tasks. It totally solves the focus problem. The dates are based on two questions: "when do I think I'd like to get this done?" and "when does this HAVE to be started to avoid grief, if any?" Then, since the lists are self-ordered based on those answers, stress disappears and focus is totally automatic. Why? 1) You know that you WILL be notified at the right time if something is slipping too far. 2) In the meantime, the most essential tasks (not just urgent) are always at the top of the lists; everything else isn't as critical. You work automatically--and more--on what matters most.<br><br>Those task dates are based in part on Michael Linenberger's "priority date" concept.<br><br>Jonathan, "little and often" does partly address the next action question for me, but there's a catch or two. If you don't know the next action, you can't answer the "when" questions accurately (see my last paragraph), so you lose that dimension of stress relief--you won't absolutely know that you will be notified, at the right time, that something is slipping too far and needs to be addressed. Also, people do tend to avoid large projects for which the next action is uncertain. Thinking for 5 minutes about the next action breaks that logjam. After you've done that for a few days, it becomes second nature. Autofocus-ers could "decide the next step" on those big projects to get past that, but they'd better write them down in the list that way if they do, lest they face that same hurdle the next time around.</div>

<div class="content">>> I can't be "intuitive" staring at a list of 200 unordered items <br><br>Huh? The only question one has to answer vis-a-vis intuition is: What do I feel like doing now? Though it was ingenious of Mr. Forster to formalize, what is already occurring anyway, into a system. <br><br>>> "when do I think I'd like to get this done?" <br><br>For most of my tasks, the answer is.. “at some point” or “sooner rather than later”. So dating my tasks don’t help.<br><br>>>  "when does this HAVE to be started to avoid grief, if any?"<br><br>Again, placing date dependent tasks into my calendar solves this problem.  <br><br>>> stress disappears and focus is totally automatic. <br><br>Can someone... ANYONE... show me evidence that stress disappears - hell, is lowered - by using a productivity system? <br><br>>> If you don't know the next action, you can't answer the "when" questions accurately<br><br>How is it possible that 99% of the world is getting along just fine without employing systems to decide upon “next actions”? How do they do it?  One would think that, besides those in the know, everyone else is in a state of paralysis, with spittle dripping down their chin. <br><br>Kevin, I apologize for the sarcasm. However I had to wade through these discussions on GTD boards back in 2002. There were times where it felt like an group therapy clinic for folks struggling with OCD.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-26 8:36</div>
<div class="content">I have to agree with Avrum on this one.  It seems intuitive that stress will be lowered if one gets one's time and commitments under control.  But that is only if time management is what is causing the stress.<br><br>I also can relate to the OCD comment.  GtD does seem to attract that personality.  The whole idea of contexts and next actions and an empty in-box, etc. really does sound a lot like compulsive hand washing ;-)<br><br>I strongly disagree with the comment about next actions being necessary, or even helpful.  One needs to plan a next action ONLY if one feels stuck not knowing what to do next.  Mostly the human mind is designed to work well at popping the next action into consciousness when we need to know what it is.<br><br>As to the estimated dates ... yeah, that is massive overkill.  Most of what is on my list is either "someday/maybe" or "as soon as possible".  Those things associated with a date need to be on the calendar.  If, in addition to all else, I had to estimate a date for everything, I'd just shoot myself!  ;-)<br></div>

I had a sort of epiphany the other day that the reason that I wasn't doing more to popularise AF was that 1) I felt that I needed to make money out of it somehow, but 2) making money involved a lot more work than I was prepared to put in (bearing in mind that I am supposed to be retired!)<br><br>I suddenly realised that the way to popularise AF was to give up any idea of making money from it, and to make everything to do with it completely free of charge.

We "sell" training and software, and we use principles we find that work best (we identify the source while being careful of trademarks). That's why we started watching AF--it's sincere flattery to mimic, and we may adopt/adapt RAF or principles. TRO combines best practices we've found from many systems, so it changes as methods evolve, like RAF.<br><br>An example: Our Trog Bar software lets users choose their system--it's not just for TRO. RAF isn't in the list yet, but I'm intrigued by that possibility (RAF doesn't REQUIRE paper, and simple software for it might be helpful for some folks). We may add it.<br><br>QUESTION: What does everyone think about offering software that facilitates RAF? (Trog Bar, for example.)

<div class="meta">2009-08-29 3:52</div>
<div class="content">More replies...<br><br>Mark ('wanting to make money on AF, deciding to make it open and free'): By making (R)AF open, keeping it simple, letting others discuss and add to it, I think you ensure its success because the world is intensely virtual-social now--I think it's the survival skill for the information flood because group decisions are right 92% of the time. That means that great ideas + a little uncertainty (which comes partly from simplicity) + openness = participation, which spreads the word ("viral"). If it becomes too proprietary or too precise, it ceases to spread by word of mouth, which hurts monetization.<br><br>Avrum, AndreasE: ('All time management systems have to be complicated to make money on them') Based on my last statement, I feel time management systems do not have to be complex, and they spread better if they aren't. However, too much simplicity can leave folks uncertain how to actually implement in THEIR situation (for example, GTD and Covey), and that hurts productivity. TRO isn't complex, but we use concepts that require new thinking, like priority dates (see below), and we explain the step-by-step for specific tools, and we show them how to organize their offices systems and deal with interruptions and IM and etc...., so training is valuable in organizing the whole person.<br><br>Mark, AndreasE: ('Wanting to sell something means it's hard') Hmmm. I just think it means they want to eat. Pet Rocks were easy, but someone sold them.... The "5 Steps to Making Money Off of Twitter" program was easy, but someone sold it successfully.<br><br>AndreasE, Mike, Avrum: ('Dating tasks has been proven useless, massive overkill,' "sooner rather than later") TRADITIONAL task dating is a waste, but TRO doesn't do that. Instead, TRO uses dates as a prioritization trick, not an actual date.<br><br>This isn't obvious, so read closely. Asking yourself "When do I think I MIGHT LIKE to get this done?" creates a "loose goal" date that weighs the Covey urgency and importance dimensions--without having to think about it. These dates are NOT estimated dates, so you don't need to shoot yourself, Mike. It's as easy as the AF "what do I feel like doing now?" BUT you only ask it once per task (3 seconds). "Sooner rather than later" is "maybe next week," so you choose that. You also don't update those dates later. When your lists are ordered by those first guess dates, they become astonishingly stressless. No scanning. Focus at the top of the list all the time.<br><br>Also, "At Some Point" or "Someday" is a date. You can easily keep those tasks out of your face until the right time without losing touch with them.<br></div>

<div class="content">Still more replies (great discussion!)...<br><br>Avrum: ('Next actions not needed') When a person procrastinates on a project, if they ask "why?" the answer is enlightening. We put it off because: 1) the time is wrong (this ISN'T procrastination, it's smart, and RAF addresses that nicely), 2) we aren't sure what to do next or have the wrong next step in mind, and in the case of the really big next steps 3) we don't have enough time allocated for that action. If you have a big thing and a little thing in front of you and you're pressed for time, which one will you do? For these cases, identifying the (small) next step may help, whether you use RAF or TRO or something else.<br><br>Mike: ("stress will be lowered [by time management] ... only if time management is what is causing the stress.") You can do SOMETHING about almost any stressor. The worst pain is suspense. If you 1) ask yourself what you CAN do about the stressor, 2) decide what that next step is towards that end, and 3) schedule that step in a way that 4) you know you actually will do it, and 5) you know that you will keep doing the next and the next steps, the stress drops off immediately, because you know relief is coming. Any approach that satisfies 1-5 would reduce the stress, as TRO does.<br><br>Avrum: ("The only question one has to answer vis-a-vis intuition is: What do I feel like doing now?") I believe different personalities respond to different methods. "Maximizers" want to know they're doing the MOST effective thing right now, so they can't be intuitive scanning a big list. They freeze up, worrying if there is something more important somewhere in the list. I'm not sure RAF can address that fear for them.<br><br>Avrum: ("placing date dependent tasks into my calendar solves this problem") If you can easily put all your date-dependent tasks in your calendar, you probably don't have a lot of them. Your task list can be an extension of your calendar in an intuitive way.<br><br>Avrum: ("Can someone... ANYONE... show me evidence that stress .. is lowered - by using a productivity system?")<br><br>Yes.

<div class="content">Hi Kevin,<br><br>I'm curious to find out how your system handles these soft 'might like to get done' dates!<br><br>You say these dates don't have to be changed. So how does your system prioritise tasks using these dates? Do you simply sort by these dates? That would make tasks that you don't do go to the top of the list after a while which might not be what you want. Is the date of task entry used to determine priority as well?<br><br>Or is this top-secret and should I go buy the training? ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Cruisader: (lol) Not top secret. We're considering open forums to discuss enhancements, etc., and even a full outline of the TRO process that can be downloaded free. The online training does a whole lot more than that.<br><br>About soft dates and stale tasks: With TRO you essentially end up with three lists: Must Do, May Do, and  Someday/Maybe. Tasks automatically separate out into those lists, you don't have to think about it. You look at Must Do daily. You look at May Do at least weekly. You look at Someday/Maybe at least monthly. The May Do list has the soft-date-only (loose goal date) tasks.<br><br>When using Trog Bar, it sorts them partly by the soft date, entry date, last-changed date, etc. for the reasons you mention. Stale tasks move down that May Do list over time automatically.<br><br>However, if you sort by soft dates only (Outlook or paper system, for example), you're right, the old, undone tasks remain at the top. So, weekly, you look at the top, cross off anything no longer applicable or move to Someday (5 min. max). Not hard.<br><br>Note that soft (loose goal) dates can be grouped roughly: this week, next week, this month, next month. That eliminates entering "dates" that can freak people out. In that case, in your 5 min weekly scan you make a second pass to see if anything should be bumped up to the next group.<br><br>This is where we're especially scrutinizing AF/RAF right now, to see where Mark's methods might automatically remove stale tasks (or elevate others) in paper May Do lists. With Trog Bar it's a cinch, but with paper it needs human effort. A 5 min weekly review isn't a burden and is actually rejuvenating, but the simpler the better.</div>

<div class="content">Kevin, many thanks for coming here and contributing so positively to the discussion. It's raising some good ideas and I'd certainly encourage you to try RAF within your company, even while Mark continues development. The concepts of bringing in Forward and Review mode occasionally are very powerful, keeping the all-in-one-place strength of AF but not forcing tasks to be deleted, rather waiting in Review mode for occasional revisiting.<br><br>Jonathan</div>
