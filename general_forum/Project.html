<div class="content">I'm a big fan of DIT and have some sympathy with those who are articulating a preference for it over AF.  But AF does overcome one objection to DIT: what does one do with projects?  I find I can just write out an entire workplan for a project ona page or two in my AF notebook, as structured as I like, and the various steps in it will present themselves naturally as the pages are repeatedly visited.</div>

<div class="content">Good point, David. That's exactly how to take best advantage of the AF system.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>That sounds rather interesting.  I have just been going through the forum looking for discussions on how to bring project management and AF together.  I somehow do not like the idea of having specific project-related tasks spread out all over my "main" AF list, especially if they constitute dependent tasks.  The thought of having what I would call major prompts in my main AF system (e.g. "Work on project X") sounds, on the one hand, much more sensible to me.  But then, what if that is too big or too vague to unleash AF's power for this specific project?  What if it only creates resistance?<br><br>That's where I find your approach very interesting.  Project-related stuff stays in one place - I can easily spot it all if I want to -, it's part of my one AF list that I am working with, and it's specific enough to trigger the needed release ("little and often").  <br><br>There is one aspect of project-management that I would wonder about in the setup you described: what do you do about changes, steps that introduce themselves later on, etc?  As far as I understand the system, they would have to be introduced at the very end of my AF list - dislocated from the rest of the project planning.<br>How do you deal with this aspect of project planning? <br><br>I would be very interested in your (or anyone else's) feedback.<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Joshua</div>

<div class="content">Just as almost any work can be broken into smaller steps so can small bits be added together into a project. The level that works best for a particular piece of work for you may not be obvious at the start. I just write the action I'm thinking of; sometimes that's a small step, sometimes it's a big project. AF allows you only to do a bit of what you have written. So with some projects, I just have the title and do small bits as they come along. With others (and because I use software that allows it) I will later split a project into smaller steps as structured as I want and all these smaller steps are just 'sub-items' or 'clarifications' in my mind. Keeps everything together, I don't spend more time working things out than I need to and maintains the cognitive simplicity of AF.</div>

<div class="content">Totally agree with Dm<br><br>Joshua, there are some similar questions and responses in the following threads which you may find helpful<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623306" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623306</a><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387</a> <br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Is there perhaps something to be said then for using AF specifically for projects? With DIT as more of a specific daily plan.</div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>I think that part of the real POWER of AF is that you enter "items" on the list and are not restricted to what those "items" are.  With GtD, for example, the admonition is to make every item an "action".  I understand the reason for that, but I have always known that what I mean by "plan X" is: "Call Joe", as that is in my mind as the next thing to do in the process of "plan x".  This has always been a point of contention between GtD advocates and myself.  An "action" is whatever you think it is, in this context.  Level of detail is a personal, and largely contextual, issue.<br><br>One reason I love AF is precisely because I can have, on the same page:<br><br>"Call Joe"<br>"Conquer the World"<br><br>The fist is a single active step ... the second RESULTS in the next obvious step to me, when I read it.  I don't need to spend time fussing with well formed actions ... unless there is a reason to.  Sometimes I need to plan, and sometimes I don't.  It all depends and the AF system gives the flexibility to do what is needed when it is needed.<br><br>The power of AF is its simplicity!</div>
