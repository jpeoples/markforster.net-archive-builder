<div class="content">I finally rebuilt my PC onto Windows 7 yesterday (FV made me do it) and have lost the colour coding of new and guru posts. <br><br>Is there an easy way to switch these back on, or am I doomed to learning to live in a world of red and greys from now on?</div>

<div class="content">Is that going to become the new excuse for everything?<br><br>"FV made me do it."</div>

<div class="content">Yup.<br><br>(Admittedly, not a great way of avoiding blame, as I am heavily implicated in the operation of my FV lists. But you've got to respect our traditions, and what could be more traditional than blaming the system? Infinitely preferable to acknowledging your own contribution, which puts you in grave danger of actually learning something. But I digress...)</div>

<div class="content">The script was written by Andreas Hoffman. I *think* the latest version was posted here <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1671341#post1684994" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1671341#post1684994</a> . Look towards the end of the thread...</div>
