<div class="content">When I was young and full of hope for a glorious future, I did study a design discipline at frollege.<br><br>There I learned something about rules in design, but also in general, that helped me in my dealings with the time management systems by various inventors, Forster, Allen, Covey, etc<br><br>Rules are there to be broken. But this comes with a caveat. You have to know where and when to break the rule. And in order to get there, you first have to learn the rule. Internalize it, before you stab it in the back.<br><br>This is why I used the time management systems always strictly according to the rules. Sticking to the rules like a stubborn zealot. Why? In order to internalize them and their functioning and two discover the underlying thoughts of the inventor.<br><br>Only then, after I had a reasonable grasp of what was meant, I would depart from it.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I think it's important to get a good feeling for the dynamics of the system. The rules and their interactions create a set of dynamics. With time management systems, it's really helpful to adopt the position of an impartial outside observer. Step back and observe the effect the rules have on your own emotions and reactions to the tasks and the work. See how resistance and motivation wax and wane. <br><br>Even with this approach, I am constantly surprised at how things play out. I am always quite certain that some rules will cause problems and so I am reluctant to try them - but then when I do try them, I find they don't cause the problem at all!  This actually happened with Serial No-List.  I had the idea for Serial No-List for at least a year before I actually gave it a try.  I was so worried that the lingering old pages would be a serious problem.  But in practice it has turned out to be a non-issue.  <br><br>Also, I have found another guiding principle to be just as important as adopting the attitude of an outside observer. It's the idea of forming hypotheses and doing experiments, as opposed to simply running off with the latest "tweak". If I have an idea how to improve my method, instead of immediately running with it, I first pause and take a moment to write it up like a scientist might write up an experiment plan.  <br><br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=scientific+experiment+template" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=scientific+experiment+template</a><br><br>Even if I don't use a formal template like that, I find it really useful just to pause long enough to think about it along these lines. I started doing this consistently about a year ago and it's been really helpful in my own experimenting.</div>
