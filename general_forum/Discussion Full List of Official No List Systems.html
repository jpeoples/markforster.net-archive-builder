<div class="content">Alan Baljeu:<br><br>"Okay, which do you feel is the smoothest and most reliable?"<br><br>I'm nearly finished testing and experimenting with all the current "No-List" systems and should have some answers when I'm done.</div>

<div class="content">Don R:<br><br>"This is amazing. Thank you for putting this together. (Somehow I also missed the entire No List FVP discussion which started 11 months ago in the FV/FVP forum.)"<br><br>Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">"Oops, sorry. I replied on that other thread. If Mark wants to move my post from there over to here (or remove it), that's fine."<br><br>That's alright. The main thing was to prevent a discussion there.<br><br><br>"One system I didn't see on the list was no-list autofocus: <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/29/no-list-and-autofocus.html"" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/3/29/no-list-and-autofocus.html"</a><br><br>Thanks for pointing that one out! That's the one I missed. I just spent some time creating posts for that system and its Rules update and have posted them to the list. That system came right before the May 9th system and hopefully I can get those posts edited later into the correct order.</div>

<div class="content">Okay the list is complete!  Which do you like, people?</div>

<div class="content">I've been using No-List FVP (I missed it the first time it was discussed) the last 2 days and I'm loving it.  However, I have said that often after 2 days, and it remains to be seen how it goes in the long run.</div>

<div class="content">I've locked the "Full List" to prevent further discussion on it, rather than here. I'll put a link to it in the "TM Systems" top menu item. Many thanks to Michael B. for collating all this.</div>

<div class="content">I would invite you to consider using the ASEM algorithm with the No-List approach... I think it is very effective...</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I had to look it up myself. It's "Another Simple and Effective Method" <a href="../blog/Another Simple and Effective Method.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html</a><br><br>I still use it myself occasionally, but I'd forgotten it was called that.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: <<How do you combine them?>><br><br><br>I've always liked ASEM. Unfortunately, if applied to a quite long catch-all list it starts to work non so well, because, as Mark reported, you tend to be confined for too much time at the beginning of the list.<br><br><br>What I discovered is that this defect disappears if you apply the algorithm to a short daily list. It has a very good balance between obbligations to execute tasks generally at the beginning of the list and a decent degree of freedom in choosing tasks generally at the end of the list.<br><br><br>So, I act like this:<br><br>1. at the beginning of the (working) day a make a (new) list of the tasks I want (must) execute by the end of the day (tipically, between 15 and 25).<br><br>2. I can add new tasks in any moment (without the obbligation to activate them immediatly), but it is mandatory to have a strong commitment to execute these tasks by the end of the day.<br><br>3. I process the list with the ASEM algorithm.<br><br>4. I start a new list every day<br><br>(I use calendar and tickler file as support to the daily list).<br><br><br>I'm really very satisfied .... nearly happy ... ;)</div>

<div class="content">Introducing a no-list approach to Autofocus:<br><br>1. Tasks are added by "standing out" when you are at the bottom of the list (or starting a new list, which is equivalent).<br><br>2. You can rewrite recurring or unfinished tasks if you think you will do them again today.<br><br>3. Once you are at the bottom and nothing stands out that's not already on the list, you draw a line underneath the last task and then start scanning from the top to see if anything stands out.<br><br>4. If you get to a line without doing any tasks in the last block, the block is dismissed (deleted). It follows that if you make it through the list without anything standing out, the entire list is dismissed and you start fresh.</div>

<div class="content">I didn't realize there is already a method similar to AF. Nevertheless the one I proposed is a bit different, and, I think, more like AF.<br><br>I haven't seen it acknowledged before, but Spinning Plates is a no-list system.</div>

I could see that working well.<br><br><< I haven't seen it acknowledged before, but Spinning Plates is a no-list system. >><br><br>Spinning Plates is based on the Rotating System, on which I designed about four different no-list systems. So it's very closely related to them.</div>
