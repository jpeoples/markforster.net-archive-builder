<div class="content">With the release of AF2 I took the leap and declared a backlog and started a new list. I started with 7 tasks on my new list, which is now almost 3 pages long.<br><br>I understand the reason behind returning to the end of the list after completing a task, but I'm struggling with it and I wondered if anyone else was having the same problem.<br><br>One of the features I liked about DIT and AF1 was the gap between identifying a task and working on it because it enabled me to think about it and decide if I really wanted to do it. However with AF2 I could return to the end of the list and find a task I added a few moments previously which is likely to 'stand out' because I've only just added it.<br><br>I want to implement AF2 with no tweaks (at least to start with ;-) ), but as I've been working on my list, I have found myself wanting to continue through the list in AF1 style. Then when I make myself return to start I'm telling myself to ignore the last few tasks I've added so I don't end up just working on new tasks.<br><br>This doesn't feel right, so have I missed something in the instructions?</div>

<div class="content">What I've begun to find is that as the day goes on the tasks earlier in the list begin to loom larger in my mind and exert more of a pull, and I become more urgently aware of the tasks that are on notice of dismissal. What is happening as a result is that I am now skimming over the tasks at the end of the list and it is tasks earlier on that are standing out. I think this is why Mark stressed the need to read through the whole list at the start of the day, and how the system works to achieve a balance between older and newer tasks over the course of the whole day. That's how it is turning out for me anyway.</div>

<div class="content">Kate:<br><br>That's what AF2 is about. If a task has just been added and it stands out, then do it. What's the problem? It's got to be done sometime. If it doesn't stand out then don't do it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I think it is a good feature of AF2, but I feel that I'm starting to get into a cycle of doing the fun things on my list because once I've done them they are added to the end again. Or maybe I'm worrying because you did such a good job of convincing me of the benefits of that gap from DIT!</div>

<div class="content">Kate:<br><br>I find that the system just naturally brings up the type of task which is appropriate for the time of day, and the time I have available. I've had a week of having to concentrate on one project so a lot of things which I normally do have been put on hold. Now that I've got over the most hectic phase of the project (organising an Arts Festival), the system is starting to bring up the things which were put on hold. All this happens without my consciously having to prioritise.</div>

<div class="content">Okay I'll trust the system and see what happens</div>

<div class="content">I've only been doing AF2 for two days, but I really appreciate the starting at the end of the list.  Often, those things on the end of the list stand out for a reason.   The fresh things may be urgent or necessary for a very good reason.  The balance comes from the "pull" of not wanting to dismiss things or even get things on the dismissal list.  That draws me back into the list.</div>
