<div class="content">I don't think it's been mentioned here so I wanted to mention I found out there's an audiobook version of Do It Tomorrow. I saw it on Audible and bought it with one of my credits; listened to about an hour of it so far (length is about 5.5 hours).  I just thought that was pretty cool and wanted to share.</div>

<div class="content">Just bought it. I'm really enjoying returning to these ideas. As I recall, I found this method really helpful and I have maintained certain aspects of it over the years. Going to give it a try for real again.</div>
