<div class="content">This morning I had to delete a post which did not come up to the standards of courtesy which I expect on this list. It's only the second time I have done this. However I just want to make it clear that I will delete posts which I do not consider are up to the standard of good manners which is normally shown on this list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and David<br>Thank you both!  Yesterday was so challenging with the pain that I contemplated being a Kamikaze pilot volunteering for ANY available mission!  *blush*  Today is much better.  I think that is the cue for my monkey mind to emerge to demand my obedience!  LOL!  Sometimes wrestling with my monkey mind is as challenging as breaking through pain bouts!  *blush*<br>My monkey has 12 more minutes to visit Uncle Mark and friends......then back into his cage while I chunk down the remainder of the scut cap.  Luckily he's in total agreement with today's regular work!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>
