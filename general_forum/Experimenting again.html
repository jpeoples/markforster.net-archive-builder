<div class="content">I hope your new system is as digital friendly as SF3/AF1 (if not more). If I have to move to fully analog, I would really miss the nice digital features: (i) easy reentering by dragging tasks, (ii) complete chronological notes attached to each task, (iii) hiding of done tasks,  (iv) easy filtering of tasks by search keywords or tagging, and (v) collapsible outlining views of pages/tasks.<br><br>Your new Magic Notebook gets me excited, especially if it is really included in your new experiment. <br><br>My current carry everywhere todo lists/devices are: <br>(1) One A4 page folded into A7 size (16 sub pages) - this is my disposable capture device, one subpage for list of immediate urgent stuff, other subpages for free form capture of stuff arising while doing things that can't/shouldn't be interrupted,<br>(2) One A7 size flip-up paper notebook - this is my archivable capture device, chronological log and notes of events/meetings/studies.<br>(3) One 7" or 4" mobile android - where my SF3/AF1 list mainly resides (same list accessible via web from other devices)<br><br>I'm stoked about your new experiment. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Currently, I am using a Moleskine notebook.  I was using AF4 revised the last 2 months and dividing into New, Unfinished, Recurring.  I used different Moleskine notebooks for each, but found that this was unnecessarily complicated.   So I have this month been keeping everything in one notebook, and creating a monthly, weekly, daily calendar as I go along when I need it, I have daily, weekly, checklists, and projects and projects notes.  The pages grow organically, chronologically.   Recurring became checklists.  I have some trouble determining whether an item is Unfinished or New.  If a new task belongs to a project, which is it?  Perhaps it doesn't matter.  Sometimes the task goes on a project page.  I keep an index in front.  I find keeping everything in one book simplifies.  I can carry it around.  I tried a ring binder with dividers, but gave up after a day - too clumsy.  <br>I have been using computer software for 11 years to manage my time, but this summer am experimenting with paper.  Looking at a computer screen with the bright light and small print is getting hard on my eyes and fatiguing.  Paper is less stressful.  I do have to scan the pages daily, as there is no search or tagging.  <br>I tried AF1 for two months, when it came out, and come back to it off and on.  I can go on that the whole day and never run out of things to do.   I don't find it good for urgent deadlines or time-consuming projects.   I end up not putting enough time into these when the deadline approaches. <br>I also tried Superfocus for a few months.  <br>I seem to do better when I have a list of things that have to be done today or this week, and a list of projects with deadlines, in addition to the rest.</div>

<div class="content">matthewS<br><br>Thanks for responding to my post.  <br>I use a Moleskine ruled notebook, 5 by 8.  There are 31 lines to each page.  When I need a calendar for a day, I draw one, using each line as a half hour.  When I need a calendar for a week, I draw one on two pages.  When I need a calendar for a month,  or a checklist for the month, I draw one, one day for each line.  Each one on the next available blank page. <br>When I start planning a project, I start a new page for one on the next blank page.   <br>I write new tasks on a separate page.  When I need to write down what I must do today, and write the llst on a new page.  <br>This means that projects are not together, and new tasks are not together, and checklists are not together, and calendars on not together, on consecutive pages. <br>I number the pages.  I have a table of contents on the first page.  If I want, I put the page number and description on the first page so I can find it. <br>I date each page. The pages will then be in chronological order of when I started each one. <br><br>I thought of using a 3-ring binder, and using dividers to separate each section, but I quickly gave it up after a day of trying it.  Flipping pages in a Moleskine is so much faster than a binder, a binder is more cumbersome to carry around.  There is still flipping of pages even with a binder with dividers.  <br>Checklists save paper.  However, keeping recurring lists and rewriting and crossing off a la AF1 perhaps is more likely to get the task done.  <br>I hope this helps.  Maybe not the perfect system, but it does have the advantage of keeping everything in one book, easy to carry around. I generally work backwards, from last page to front.</div>

<div class="content">markhedm,<br><br>Your free-form notebook of lists/calendars/notes/plans sounds intriguing. I like the idea of a bound notebook and just creating a new page for whatever you need at the moment, with all the organization in the chronology and table of contents. Not sure it would work for me – I tend to write notes on index cards, engineering pads, email and article printouts, etc. so I need to maintain an Active/Pending stack of paper, which I don't carry around all day like I do with my pocket AF notebook.<br><br>How many pages are in your notebook? How long have you been using this method?  What happens when you run out of pages – do you carry around two notebooks for a while, or transfer what you need into the new one?<br><br>Sorry I have so many questions. Perhaps you should start a new post on this topic, as it's not really related to Mark F.'s experiments (I don't think)…</div>

<div class="content">The mix has changed again a bit today. AF2 is out and AF1 back in. The DIT and AF4 (revised) elements have been strengthened, and DWM reduced, Dismissal has been re-introduced and the waterfall is out. I've made some minor changes to the order in which things happen so as to speed up the processing of new tasks.<br><br> What I'm engaged in at the moment is bringing all my work into the system, so the load on it is gradually increasing.

<div class="content">Coincidentally, I've arrived at a similar point. Starting with superfocus, I've slowly made little tweaks, passing through that AF on a planner, back to something like AF4R (  <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1325521" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1325521</a> ), except with Old/new running like AF1.

<div class="content">Zane,<br><br>Mark has recommended separate notebooks for separate places before. I like the "cave deposits" method (stalagmite/stalactite) where you list one context top-down, and the other bottom-up on each page. When the two sublists meet, draw a heavy horizontal line to separate. I hope the new experiment will allow this type of context separation.</div>

<div class="content">No dismissal at all? This is not something I expected to hear from you. I look forward to seeing how the new system handles all the good things that dismissal does.<br><br>I'll accept your definition of pipe dreams, but also point out that Dreams helps us look at pipe dreams (the castle by the sea) and decide if they should stay that way or enter the process of being refined and made real. I've moved a few pipe dreams to action over the years, and been very glad I did.<br><br>Definitely looking forward to seeing the new system.</div>

<div class="content">That video is amazing, especially the first bit when each ball does three things. If you want the first note, you get two others, and they have to work.</div>

<div class="content">Animation or not, from what I saw of the first bit, if a ball is thrown it makes all three sounds.<br><br>Somewhere there's a Japanese commercial of Pachelbel's Canon in D Major done by a ball falling down a series of wooden blocks, but I can't find it.</div>

<div class="content">Hugo,<br><br>That's a great video. The song is "Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring" by Bach, not Pachelbel's Canon, so I'm not sure if it's the one Cricket remembers. It's interesting that the tempo varies quite a bit, even though they obviously took a lot of care to keep the slope constant, and built longer pieces of wood for longer notes. So if anyone tries to replicate one of Animusic's concepts in actual hardware, with pipes and balls rolling and bouncing, they would need to take this type of variability into account.</div>

<div class="content">Haven't been there for a while but what a surprise, a new system!<br>In fact I have tried most of Mark's systems, some lasted weeks and others months, but never a whole year. I guess they were too compulsive or not efficent enough (this balance is hard to get).<br>I am eager to try this new 2 to 7 thing, the sooner the better (^o^)/</div>
