<div class="content">As I am always striving for the simplest system, I was trying to see if I could devise a time management system so simple the instructions could fit on a 3 inch by 3 inch post it note.  You can see the post it on my website, here is what it says.<br><br>Write everything you have to do or manage and all of your notes in one place (legal pad or spiral notebook) with pages that tear out so you can file them in your A-Z filing system.  It is ok to scan things and have an electronic filing system.  Do not use things like stuff people send you for reminders instead use your notebook for everything you must do.  Look at it often.<br><br>It is an interesting exercise to see if you can boil something down into simple terms and have it be useful. <br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Lots of contingencies in there. You could easily shorten that by choosing the specifics (eg spial notebook) you wish to adopt and only write those.</div>
