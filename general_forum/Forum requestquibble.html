<div class="content">I don't know if this is a limitation of Squarespace or not... currently when I tick the "notify me of follow-up comments via email" box, I get notified for ALL forum postings, not just for the topic that I was responding to. Is it possible to set things up such that we can "subscribe" to specific topics?<br><br>Thanks in advance!</div>

<div class="content">I had that happen to me once, but then another time I only got replies to the one thread I wanted.  In the first case, I was the person who started the thread, and in the second case, I only replied to a thread.  So that might be the difference.  Definitely a bug, I think.</div>

<div class="content">We had some trouble with this a few weeks back but it appeared to be only a temporary glitch. I'll do a bit of experimenting and see what exactly is happening so I can report it to Squarespace.<br><br>What is supposed to happen is that you only get notified of follow up comments to the one post. But additionally Registered Commenters can subscribe to the whole comment feed. It sounds as if those two are getting mixed up a bit.</div>

<div class="content">Ok I've signed out now and am posting as an unregistered commenter. I should get notifications from this thread only. Could a few people please put test comments below this please.</div>

<div class="content">That's ok. I've just received a notification of michael's reply and no other comments.<br><br>Now I'll try opening a thread as an unregistered commenter.</div>

<div class="content">It occurs to me that I've been commenting as unregistered (because I forget to log in and then just deal with the captcha). That may well be the difference.</div>

<div class="content">I've now tried ticking the follow up comments box as an Unregistered User both for a new thread and for a comment within another thread. It seems to be working fine, so I think it must have just been a glitch.</div>
