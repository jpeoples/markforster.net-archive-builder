<div class="content">FV is best for momentum, getting on a roll, defeating procrastination.<br><br>AF is more Tao; doing what stands out<br><br>In the pursuit of the Tao, every day something is dropped.<br>Less and less is done<br>Until non-action is achieved.<br>When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.</div>

<div class="content">AF brings more ease, non-striving and unforced action. This is a real test for  strivers, achievers and strugglers.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, AF does that, but it doesn't deal well with urgency, and it doesn't have a mechanism to prevent the list from growing faster than one's ability to process it.   Dismissal helps but the mechanism works only if you revisit pages frequently.   If one process one page per day but adds two new ones, one never revisits pages at all.  (Speaking from experience...)<br><br>The tricky part about AF is that it is so absorbing that one does not immediately realize how far behind one is getting.<br><br>If one's goal is to be in a constant state of flow and a feeling of happy accomplishment, AF1 works great!!<br><br>If one also has the goal of accomplishing specific tasks by a certain deadline, AF1 can work great, but not in an environment of great urgency or too many incoming tasks (i.e. too many commitments).   <br><br>AF1 can handle small to medium doses of urgency quite well, and it can even cure a mild case of overcommitment, but too much of either urgency or overcommitment renders AF1 ineffective.  The "ease, non-striving, and unforced action" turns into uncertainty and panic as soon as one realizes one has dropped important urgent tasks and missed important commitments.</div>
