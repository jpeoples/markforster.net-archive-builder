<div class="content">I've decided to try something new. Long list systems tend to overwhelm me or I get busy with busyness and I can't communicate on overview to my boss of where stuff is at.  So here's my new plan....<br><br>- all my undone stuff is now a backlog<br>- new stuff is going on a DIT list but with sections for<br>  - commitments made to others<br>  - things I think of on my own<br>  - things I must do in the day<br>  - things I'd like to do in the day<br>  - diary for day<br><br>When I get to work tomorrow I'll (from memory) write down things I must do and would like to do in the day and I'll copy out my outlook meetings for the day.  During the day I'll capture the tasks for tomorrow in the commitments to others and things I think of sections.<br><br>The day after tomorrow once I've done my initial brainstorm then I'll work the list in the following order: must do, commitments to others then whatever I like.<br><br>I'll be scanning my e-mails all day because I get messages like, "this afternoon's meeting is now in meeting room 8" that I need to have read.<br><br>Wish me luck.</div>
