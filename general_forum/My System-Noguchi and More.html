<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I'm a busy grad student, so I keep a Noguchi filing system at home and then use a mobile Noguchi on the road (portable file case).  Everything has gone well, but I was surprised to find that the single envelope for each class is insufficient and adding more envelopes won't work well.  I also tried removing outdated info from the individual course envelopes but that didn't alleviate the problem.  <br><br>Unfortunately, I'll be switching to binders I believe, but thought I'd post what I'm doing in case it was helpful to someone else.  It'd definitely be useful to students/faculty who have few hard copy things to keep track of and want to stay organized.</div>
