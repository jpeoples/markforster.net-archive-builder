<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-05-16 0:09</div>
<div class="content">Bit of a long post here - but posting helps me think through things, so bear with me...<br><br>A few people have discussed keeping separate 'project lists' for project related tasks. A good idea in theory - you get key projects a) organised, and b) integrated into the AF way of working - which actually gets them done, whilst stopping the lower level tasks which make up these projects from congesting the AF list itself.<br><br>The problem is that it is not trivial to prevent these separate project lists from hampering the AF 'flow'. It is quite easy to get distracted by all those extra lists, and lose the 'trusted system' aspect of AF (which to my mind relies on there being only one list - or at least only one per location). So I've developed a set of workflow 'rules' for dealing with project lists, which I think retains the flow of AF quite nicely.<br><br>The key point I noticed (and I'm sure others have too) is that the feeling of starting AF is very different, and in many ways more liberating, than working a more mature AF system. Having had this feeling a number of times when re-starting a new notebook, I've realised it's not a novelty thing - It's actually a feature of working AF with a very small list: It's really liberating (not to mention productive) when faced with a mountain of tasks, to just write one or two down without worrying about completeness or priority, and simply start working, knowing that the list will develop and priorities arise naturally as you go through.<br><br>I realised that you can get the same effect at any time within standard AF by turning to the last page and allowing yourself to work off the end of the list - I call this 'last page mode', although if you go over a page turn it's actually more like 'last couple of pages'. This is used to avoid the procrastination which might otherwise arise when meeting a big project-type task on the list.<br><br>Anyway, I've created various project task lists (within Evernote in my case) for 'project' type tasks. The key for these projects is not to over-engineer the concept: the projects arise of themselves whenever I feel that there are a lot of smaller-scale tasks in a given area which should be grouped - either to rationalise the AF list, or to get the benefits of better organisation and reportability within the project.<br><br>My workflow 'rules' for dealing with these are then:<br><br>1. As I come across a 'Review Project X' task - I always use 'review' as my verb - and it stands out, I mark it by placing a dot to the left, as usual, and then open the project list in Evernote<br><br>2. After reading through the project list, I delete any tasks which have been completed, or which I feel no-longer need to be done<br><br>3. I next quickly check the items on the AF page just above the task I've just marked, to see if there are any items belonging to this project which should be added to the project list (the reason for this step will become clear by the end). If there are, I add them to the project list, and delete them from the AF page.<br><br>4. Moving down the project list, I see if a project task 'stands out'. If it does, I write it at the end of the AF list. I then start working on the task. (Essentially I'm now working in 'last page mode', but with my page marker still at the point I left off in the list with the original project task). I would only not write down the task if it was really trivial to complete quickly. I then carry on working off the last page - additional tasks spawned from the original project task get added here, as do new tasks which 'stand out' from the project list again, as do unrelated tasks which I think of.<br><br>5. I continue working in 'last page' mode 'for as long as I feel like' - although I find it helps to timebox this. After I'm done, or when no further project tasks stand out, I re-write the original 'Review Project X' task at the end of the list, and then return to the page I left, crossing the original project task off, and then continuing normal AF with that page. (This is why I include item 3 - because tasks immediately above a project task are often tasks which have been thrown up the last time I worked on that project, and so might belong on the project list).<br><br>For the rest, it's standard AF, although I use the following 'tweaks':<br>- Moving an isolated task to a project list counts as taking action on the task<br>- I make sure I have a task on the list to 'review projects', so that I know what project lists I have, and can reorganise them if necessary<br>- I occasionally work in 'last page mode' - as above - with urgent tasks which arise, and which then spawn other tasks, and also with tasks which weren't necessarily associated with a project list, but which nevertheless start breaking down into sub-tasks as I work on them. Again, timeboxing is really useful here.<br><br>Well, as I said, sorry for the long post. I hope it helps some people - although my motivation is mostly selfish: not only did writing it clarify my thinking, but I now get the benefit of everyone's expertise and comments!</div>

<div class="content">Ed<br><br>Thanks for spelling out in full exactly how your approach functions.<br><br>For me, it looks too complicated.  Would you consider leaving the actions taken on the project exactly where they are in the project folder and working from there whilst you are on that project?  What value is there in transferring those actions to the AF list before you do them?  Furthermore, as you observe, it forces you to work in "last page mode" during the time you are on that project.  <br><br>Mostly, when I am working on a project, I am focused totally on that project and my AF list is left totally aside (especially if it is a project that feels familiar to me.)<br><br>When I am temporarily finished working on the project and needing to re-enter at the end of AF, it helps me to include a reminder as to where I am up to with the project.  (E.g. Garden revamp - clip hedges.)<br><br>Does this approach frustrate any aspect of your method that would be important for you?</div>

<div class="content">Jim,<br><br>I don't think it 'forces' me to work in 'last-page mode'. Rather, I find this gives me a positive benefit, similar to the feeling of release from having to choose the most optimal next action which I got when I was first starting my AF list.<br><br>I think the main reason you're thinking it's over-complicated is the example project you gave. Something like a garden re-vamp has fairly clear next actions, and I suspect there's no real pressure to try to find the most efficient next action. I probably wouldn't use the method for this type of project - my house renovation for example. I'm thinking more of work projects, which for me tend to be more cerebral. Here, starting on one project action immediately makes me think up about 10 others, going in multiple directions. I need to be comfortable that these are being captured so that I can focus on the task at hand, and the trusted capture location is my main AF list. (Otherwise I'm constantly thinking - should this task be added to the project list? or the AF list? or another project list?... Also, having the project lists in non-paper form is an advantage, but not when it comes to adding tasks to them, where paper is far more efficient).</div>

<div class="content">Ed<br><br>My garden example was not a real project, just one that is concrete and easy for illustrating the point about using an AF entry to remind me where I was up to with a project.<br><br>Actually, I imagine that the more complicated the project becomes the less likely I would be to feed the threads back into AF.  If however your project tracking consists of lists kept digitally then I understand your dilemma a bit better.  However, when you say you find yourself "going in multiple directions" I wonder if some form of "mind-mapping" might serve you better. <br><br>Like you, if I felt that ideas that were not directly related to the current project were coming up, then I would certainly add them to the AF list to be dealt with at another time.<br><br>Ed, your post seems to raise again the question of whether AF can be used as a project management tool.  You seem to have found a clever way of using it to do just that but I tend to shy away from using AF for that purpose if the project is anything more that just a few very simple steps or if I need a trigger to take me back to the project as a whole or else to some active and independent sub project that is a part of the whole project.</div>

<div class="content">As with many things, your mileage may vary. I personally have never really got on with mindmaps, or any other planning tools, because I usually want to 'dive in' and start working on things. Partly this is because in most cases I find it's not obvious from the start what needs to be done, so it's easy to get bogged down and start over-planning. The great thing about AF for me is that the planning happens organically as I go through.<br><br>(As an interesting aside on over-planning, I read somewhere that the US marines don't make detailed plans for operations for precisely this reason. Although then again, looking at Iraq, maybe they're as wrong on this as I am!)</div>

<div class="content">Ed:<br><br>I don't know about the US Marines, but military planning is always subject to the principle: "When the enemy has two possible courses of action open to him, he'll do the third".</div>
