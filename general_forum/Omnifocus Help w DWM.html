<div class="content">As a therapist using DWM, I enter the following information into Omni iPhone after seeing a client:<br><br>$$$ (money owed for today's session)<br>Context: blank<br>Project: Client's name<br>Start: Today's date (so I remember the day I saw the client for billing purposes)<br>Due: 31days (following the DWM rule for new items)<br><br>That's it. However my list becomes overrun with individual client entries. Very annoying. One option would be to have one item on my DWM for each client with the subject: Bill Client. Perhaps I could keep an account of what people owe me in Evernote or in a paper journal instead of Omnifocus. However I would like to keep all this information in one place. <br><br>Any thoughts on this matter?<br><br><br>That's it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum,<br><br>Maybe you need to have the following in your routines/closed list:<br><br>Daily Routine: client bill processing<br>Weekly Routine: review client billing and payments<br>Monthly: client account review (who owes how how much)<br><br>Maybe a simple spreadsheet would keep things going, generate daily, weekly, monthly, year-to-date information.  I assume the iPhone has a spreadsheet facility.<br><br>Your accountant can maybe help with setting things up that meets your needs and his - NB, always meet your own information needs (legal!) first, then the accountants!</div>

<div class="content">Since you're not now utilizing the context field, what if you did? Name it something like "money owed", then exclude it from your main work view.<br><br>I'm using OmniFocus quite happily with multiple contexts, even though contexts are not officially part of  DWM.<br><br>My main OF perspective is Grouping=DUE, Sorting=DUE. This gives me a long list, from today on into the future, regardless of any assigned context. You could do this, select ALL contexts, unselect the one you don't want to see, then save the result as a new perspective.<br><br>You'd probably want to add a task: check "money owed" context!</div>
