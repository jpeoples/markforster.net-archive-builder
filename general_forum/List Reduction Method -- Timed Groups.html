<div class="content">I've used this method on and off for a few months, and it's time to go for it. Not for everything, but for the areas it works. It won't eliminate my lists totally, but it drastically reduces them.<br><br>Many of the tasks on my lists are left-overs from an attempt to schedule everything. My weekly schedule erratic enough that I can't do the same thing on the same day each week. It's open enough that I don't feel the pressure to get things done while I can. Cleaning and paperwork are good examples. As long it's comfortable and the bill are paid, the pile just keeps growing.<br><br>Also, many of the tasks are hard to predict. No sense mopping the floor on Monday if did while cleaning a spill on Sunday. Needed more often in the summer or if we have guests.<br><br>Each group is an area that needs a variety of work done. Be aware of the nature of each of the tasks. Some need to be done more often. Some can usually wait another day (and under most systems keep getting put off). Some are long. Some are predictable.<br><br>Include at least one trigger task, which you have to do often. It works best if the tasks have some variety in frequency and length. Include one backlog or long-term project that can be done in small bits.<br><br>Pick a reasonable time, between 15 minutes and 2 hours.<br><br>Example: Kitchen.<br><br>Daily dishes is the trigger. First, the tasks that obviously need doing (dishes and new spills); then things that build up but can usually wait (bottom of toaster); finally the big project of deep cleaning each cupboard. (I don't have to start with the trigger, but usually the trigger is the most important thing in the group.)<br><br>Some days, it takes more than 15 minutes to clean the dishes. If so, finish the dishes and call it done. Some days cleaning one spill leads to pulling out the stove. Other days, I spend mostly on the cupboards.<br><br>Experience shows that 15 minutes a day usually gives me enough time to do 10% of the cupboards every week, so in 10 weeks I'll finish every cupboard. At that time, I'll probably add shelves from another room.<br><br>Example: Paperwork<br><br>The order is: Scan inbox, urgent, rest of inbox, finish accounting in order that makes sense. The backlog is the big pile of filing that needs thinking. When that's done, I'll purge my old files.<br><br>I still don't have a trigger for this one, but when I do 60 minutes twice a week I pull ahead nicely. I used to do 30 minutes a day, but find it takes so long to get into the zone that an hour less often works better.<br><br>Variation: Before Leaving the Room<br><br>FlyLady likes this one. Every time you leave a room, take something with you. I'll add to that. Before you leave a room, deal with two things. That works for most of our rooms. If a large pile arrives (clean laundry), it needs attention. Otherwise, two things a few times a day keeps ahead of it.<br><br>Variation: Pick an Area<br><br>Pick one at random and do 15 minutes. Stay there the whole time. It's amazing how many things you ignored for years will become visible. They aren't sitting there clogging up the list. You don't need to add them to the list so you don't forget them. They're just there waiting for you to take the time to look. If you realize an area needs extra attention, skip the random bit for a few days.<br><br>++++<br><br>This method means I don't need to list every single thing to ensure it gets done, and things not on the list also get done. I actually get to my backlogs and things that don't strictly need to be done today, since I'm stuck there anyways. <br><br>So far, so good.</div>

<div class="content">Like. The before leaving the room reminds me of one of those Good Boyscout rules that I grew up with, you know, before leaving a location, at least pick up one piece of trash and take it out with you...</div>
