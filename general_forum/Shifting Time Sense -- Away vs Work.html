<div class="content">After a month of driving to appointments and errands, I finally realized something.<br><br>I need a different time sense for errands than I do for work in one place.<br><br>It takes an hour to drive my daughter 15 minutes. I need to finish what I'm doing and prepare to leave the house (often includes close file or put in supper). Her teacher insists "there's time to do one last thing before you go," so I have to say I'll be there 15 minutes before I really need to, which means I need to actually be there. Then there's allowance for traffic and parking.<br><br>Then I look at my list of quick tasks, and it feels like it will take forever to prepare to make a few quick phone calls.</div>
