<div class="content">Hi Mark, everyone: <br><br>Sorry to start tweaking so soon, I know sometimes it seems counterproductive :(<br><br>In my large moleskine I plan to try the following layout - <br><br>Left page: labelled 'new/recurring' at the top, items listed from top to bottom.<br><br>Right page: labelled 'unfinished' at the top (I plan to set a Work in Progress type limit of 3 for focus - but limit could be set to more or less than 3 or no limit set at all), items listed from top to bottom. <br><br>Right page: labelled 'today' (or 'urgent') at the bottom, items listed from bottom to top. <br><br>I like the sturcture to this, can anyone see any potential pitfalls?</div>

<div class="content">I don't get this "today" label.  By my understanding, you should be going through several pages today, and doing stuff on both sides.<br><br>I don't see anything special happening by sorting the right side into urgent and unfinished.  If it pleases you to see, go ahead.</div>

<div class="content">Yes Alan, <br><br>Urgent label is better, didn't really think it through fully...<br><br>My brain seems to like visual catagories and chunks and hoped the idea might serve some value to others also.</div>

<div class="content">leon:<br><br>I don't see that this will damage the system, but equally I can't see any real advantage in doing it this way. But as Alan says, if it pleases you to see, go ahead.<br><br>One thing I do not recommend is setting a limit for the unfinished tasks. As I've said before the system forces you to think about what you put in Column 2.You will lose this advantage if you set an arbitrary limit.</div>
