<div class="content">While I am enjoying using AF2 to plow through my work, I'm still trying ot find the optimum solution for billable time.  I work from home and I try to put in 4-6 hours of billable time daily.  If I follow AF (any variation) I end up with a mix of billable and non-billable tasks.  All of them need to be done eventually, but I want to make sure I am meeting my minimum of 4 billable hours per day.  I've tried using the calendar to block out project time, but this does't always work. I may block off 2 hours to work on a project only to find out that 30 minutes into it I need to clarify something with the client before I can proceed.  <br><br>I always have enough work to fill in the hours, but how can I make it stand out from the rest of the tasks on my list?  Should I run a separate list for billable items?  That doesn't seem worthwhile because sometimes items that start out as non-billable end up being billable once I start working on them...like "Call client abc" who then says go ahead with the changes which sometimes I do on the fly while on the phone with them so they can review them instantly in their browser.<br><br>Does anyone have any thoughts on using AF to manage this?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gretchen,<br><br>I am in exactly the same situation - I am an accountant!<br><br>My AF list, as yours is, seems to be have billable & non-billable time mixed together so I think I'm in the same boat as you!</div>

<div class="content">I used to find that a problem when I was doing consulting work from home and found Above & Beyond (mentioned elsewhere on this forum) to be a good application.  However I frequently had multiple projects or sub projects on the go at any one time which could be worked on sporadically, particularly when clients called with specific questions, and with AF there is the tendency for similar erratic work patterns.  <br><br>I think what I would do were I in that situation at present would be to produce a basic daily spreadsheet with a list of projects and just add a tick for each billable time block worked.  Then just add the ticks to identify actual time worked and add a task to AF to action the administration aspect of that billing process.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jason.  The approach I'm using now is to block off time on my calendar for billable hours and then I cherry pick from my AF list so I'm only snagging items I can bill for.  It sort of works.  I just hate blocking off my calendar for this, but I can't find a smoother way to do this and still make sure I meet the number of hours I need to pay my bills.  :D</div>

<div class="content">I keep my billable client tasks on separate pages in my AF book.  Using AF Condensed, I pull smaller tasks that I can do remotely onto my daily list and when I have all day to work in the client's office, I work straight from my AF list.  <br><br>I record my time worked on a one page monthly calendar.  But ordinarily I do blocks of time and then some daily one-offs that I just estimate a round # of hours for.  I've become pretty good at guesstimating billable time after having done it on and off for 18 years.  I used to be really bad about eating time.  <br><br>When I had a lot of clients (audit / accounting / tax), I kept time logs and spreadsheets (days of month on rows and client names on columns) - it made billing really easy.<br><br>How do you want the billable tasks to stand out Gretchen?  Is it that you're not doing enough billable time, or you want the *amount* of time you spend to stand out?<br><br>Are you guys using a digital application or paper AF?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the ideas...I already keep client work as a separate list, but now I'm thinking I need to have one page/list per client.  That would help me keep a specific punch list for them and I can note on each line how much time was spent on the task.  If I don't finish it, I can add the time spent, mark it off and re-enter it.  <br><br>I think my main concerns are figuring up if I spent a total of 4+ hours doing actual billable work.  I add items to invoices as they are completed, but there's no way to get a total amount of hours billed for the day from the invoicing. I think the calendar is still the best approach for me to make sure I have the available time to get to the billable work.  I'll still keep a work AF list for the non-calendered time.  I'm going to try this now as I'm coming up on my billable block in about 10 minutes.  Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">I am in a similar situation.  My billable tasks are marked by a category heading. A(dministration) B(illable, business) H(ouse or is it home), .... It started as a way to make the description of a task more complete and identifiable. <br><br>Besides that I use Paymo (thanks Joshua) to register billable time. It is easy for computer related tasks as it marks computer inactivity, allowing to count or dismiss time after a period off keyboard. Paymo allows to report by project and by week.<br></div>

<div class="content">I use SlimTimer (<a href="http://slimtimer.com)" rel="nofollow">http://slimtimer.com)</a> to track time spent on projects. When I make sure the list of projects in there is complete, it's very easy to switch time-tracking between projects, even when work on a specific project is interrupted by a phone call about another project.</div>

<div class="content">I work from home as well, and have to track everything I do for a two-month trial we're running with my company, with me as the guinea pig.<br><br>A lot of my work is writing, which as most have discovered, isn't always possible for hours on end. I have a ton of stuff assigned to me, and the only way I can get to it all without the last-minute-essay-panic feeling is by using AF2 and breaking everything I have to do down into manageable bits.<br><br>But sometimes after a few 'sessions' of working on various writing projects I need a break or feel like doing something else just to keep my brain fresh. For all of this stuff I started using Klok, which runs on the Adobe Air platform (basically flash for your desktop). <br><br>Although it's not the greatest-designed interface ever, the nice thing about it is that you can right-click in the system tray, have a list of your 10 monst recent projects pop up, and just pick any one of them and start logging time. Then of course you can add comments and move things around and round up or down and everything else later.<br><br>There are also times when I need to close the computer and draft copy on paper, and I can put my laptop on standby, turn it back on later, and Klok will adjust its tracking without a hitch.<br><br>Best free solution I've found so far. I had to find a solution that required a really minimal amount of clicks in order to track time (anything web based or too complex is just too much overhead), and this was it.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a lawyer and have the same dilemma about needing to get in enough billable time everyday.  I use Responsive Time Logger (<a href="http://www.responsivesoftware.com)" rel="nofollow">http://www.responsivesoftware.com)</a> to track my billable time, do invoices, etc.  You can set it so that you can see the total number of hours you've billed so far that day when you look at the program at the bottom of the screen (to the left of the system tray).  But I have the problem that I'm more resistant to doing billable tasks than non-billable ones, so putting in enough billable hours is always a big challenge.</div>

<div class="content">I know I'm digging up an old thread, but I had a little brainstorm about this today.  I've been blocking time on my calendar for client projects (a la the Mick McCool and Joe Slobb example from DIT).  <br><br>I think the missing piece for me is being able to connect the calendar with an invoice...and today it hit me.  When I add the client to my calendar, I can add the open invoice number after their name like this: ClientName INV#12345.  This allows me to search Google calendar by client name to see all appts or by client name/invoice number for a specific project for them or just "INV#" to see all billable timeblocks in a list. <br><br>And to clarify what I decided on form my original post, I keep separate client lists and then block off time to go through as many items on the list as possible.  I keep repeating the timeblocking until the project gets completed.  This makes my billing much more accurate and gives me a history of when and how much time it took me to do various things.  If I think of something for another project while I'm working, I just add it to my active AF list and process it to the appropriate client list later.  This seems to work the best.</div>
