<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Just to make sure that I have this correct -- I think I have seen several variants on here -- when one should proceed to the next page.  So I have done the rapid scan on a page, then gone through and done the slow scan, and have picked a task that is standing out for me.  Let's say this is on the middle of the page.  I make a notation where I was on the page.  I now have completed that task and I am back at where I left off.  I continue the scan down the page.  Now here's my question.  If I do not see anything else that stands out on the remainder of the page, do I go back to the start of the same page, or do I now proceed on to the next active page?<br><br>I am finding AF to work better each and every day!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David.<br><br>This question was asked, and answered.  I can't find it in the forum, but I know it's been addressed by Mark.  If you continue to the bottom of the page, and don't find anything else that stands out you are to continue to the next page.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>You continue going round the page until you have gone through the complete page from top to bottom without any item standing out. That allows you to do the items on the page in any order, but still looking at them one at a time.</div>

<div class="content">Looks like I crossed posts with you.  I understood it the way I have it written.  That seems to be working well for me.  <br><br>By the way, thank you Mark, this is one of the best systems I've tried, and I've tried many, so very many.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David - was writing an answer to another post before I got here but see you have the answer!<br><br>Silvia, if you find any helpful links could you add them to the FAQ's post - that would be really helpful.<br><br>In case you all thought I had forgotten I will do a Links Summary shortly (and the MBTI stats list!)</div>

<div class="content">Hmm....seems to be a little bit of confusion here.  So Mark, you state that one should go back to the top of the page you are on and go through it all again...instead of going on to the next page.  I just want to be sure of what is best to do and in accordance with your design.  <br><br>I do think the there needs to be some stark clarification on this posted so that we all don't do it apart from what Mark had designed.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, you start at the top of the first active page, scan it quickly, and then pass through it more slowly.  Take some action on the first task that stands out. Move down the list and take action on the next task that stands out, then the next, then the next and so on 'til you reach the bottom of the page.  You then start the same page again and repeat the process. It is only when no further tasks stand out on that page that you move on to the next. <br><br>hope that helps ....</div>

<div class="content">Okay -- this was good clarification, Christine B.  Thanks!  I would suggest adding this to the FAQ as I cannot be the only person that has had some confusion on this.<br><br>Thanks again for your help, Christine B!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Perhaps something like this?<br><br>"Continue going round the same page in the same way. Don't move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out."</div>

<div class="content">This is very good Mark.  It is amazing that a really simple concept can be confusing.  But I think this is more my fault than yours!<br><br>This along with Chritine B's comments have really made it clear.  Cheers!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Well actually that was para. 5 of the Quick Start from the original instructions!</div>

<div class="content">hehehe, I noticed immediately MF was quoting himself! I followed the instructions, read the quick start and then, after practice, the whole text. On the second or third day I spent time reading for the second time the detailed instructions carefully, with all attention.  This helped me a lot.</div>
