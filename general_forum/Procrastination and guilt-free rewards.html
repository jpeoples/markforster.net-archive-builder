<div class="content">First of all, I promise this isn't a tweak! (well, not really)<br><br>One of the great strengths of AF (both types) is the inclusion of less nasty 'rewards' - meaning that you get 'guilt-free play' (in the words of Neil Fiore's 'The Now Habit') built in.<br><br>But if 'as long as you feel like' for some of the more nasty tasks means 'until you get stuck', and then you move off to a nicer task, then you've effectively rewarded yourself for your procrastination. Do that often enough and your 'guilt-free rewards' are increasingly not guilt-free at all!<br><br>What I'm doing is, when a nasty task 'stands out' (as they frequently do!), I not only mark that task with a dot, but also then look for and mark a reward task. (Actually, if the reward task is not on the final page, I'm crossing it out and re-entering, with a mark, on the final page). I then set a timer to do at least 30mins on my nasty task, knowing that I've got a nice reward task on the last page that I've committed to doing when I've successfully done my stint. I'm finding this quite a good way of pulling me through the stuck task.<br><br>I wonder whether identifying the 'next' task, as well as the one you're about to work on, might help people focus more as a general approach than as a specific strategy for the 'stuck' nasty tasks.</div>

<div class="content">If I follow AF rules to a "T", guilt and mindfulness guide my actions. For example, I have "surf the web" on my list. Pre-AF days, I'd mindlessly surf the web until:<br><br>a) I had a client<br>b) a pressing deadline was upon me<br>c) it was time to go to bed<br><br>With AF, I'm "forced" to highlight "surf the web", and then reenter it as a task at the end/beginning of my list. This provides enough of a gap to help me choose to do something else, probably more aligned with my goals. <br><br>The key is to follow the rules.</div>
