<div class="content">Hi all.<br><br>As some of you know, I am the author of FocusPad, an iPhone app that can be used instead of paper to implement all versions of AF.<br><br>Just thought I would let you know that I have released an update to FocusPad that syncs with the web. This was the #1 feature request, so I am sure this will make many of you happy.<br><br>The web version of FocusPad is at <a href="http://focuspad.ws." rel="nofollow">http://focuspad.ws.</a> You can use it with or without the iPhone app. Just use your Google account to log in (it uses Google App Engine).<br><br>Note that the web version is still under development, and it is bound to get slicker and faster over the coming months. <br><br>(The next update to FocusPad will have multiple pads, ticklers, and search. I hope to have that ready in 4-6 weeks.)</div>

<div class="content">I have been using FocusPad on my IPhone and I really like it. It is simple but that is ideal for me--keeps me focused. Looking forward to trying it on the web as well. Thank you.<br><br>Lauren</div>

<div class="content">With a few more functions: tickler and search (my dream would be to have an computer software option and tags), this setup is going to kick a**. I've dropped The HIt List, and come back.</div>

<div class="content">Tony - one long page, and Firefox search, satisfies my needs (at least when using FP online).</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Tony.  I am really looking forward to the next release, as it is just possible that it may be the final step to achieve my perfect TM system!!   AF3 plus FocusPad are proving a very effective combination for me.  I like the short pages, which allow all tasks to be seen by just one action, swiping, without scrolling too.  Clearing the oldest tasks and closing off short pages is a great incentive to keep the list moving. Many thanks for your development time Tony.  I am sure I'm getting rather more than 59p worth of value from your efforts!  Maybe 2010 will be the year when I do indeed get everything done ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I've just had a look at the web interface--not the iphone app yet--and: very nice! Is this intended for pre-AF4? It seems to me the metaphor of pages is no longer necessary???<br><br>Mabe that's the reason for the "one long list" requests?<br><br>I'm going to play with the web version for a while, but I'm sure I'll want to buy the app. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi DS,<br>FocusPad is fine for any version of AF, in the same way as a notebook is.  I just happen to use AF3 as it suits me better than AF4.  Re the pages, in my view this is a distinctive feature of FocusPad compared with many of the other list apps available which are just 'one long list'.<br>Jane</div>

<div class="content">Nice work, Tony. Thanks for improving the app icon, too - it fits in much better on my home screen now.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all. Thanks for the kind words about FocusPad.<br><br>I myself find pages to be an incredible motivator. I was so happy yesterday when I finally trimmed the blackberries and I could delete a page that had been there for weeks. So even though AF4 does not require pages, I still find tremendous value in them.<br><br>That said, I have had many requests for "one long page", so I will try and make that an option for the next version.</div>

<div class="content">For me Focuspad is the best software for Autofocus money could buy. Especially with web sync. Highly recommended for iPhone owners.</div>
