<div class="content">Motivation which is aligned with a dream and passion is natural will. But I'd suggest it is not a will to get a result but to be a certain state of being. What I think Mark would call "pull" mode is really permission to be more of who you can be. For many of us though "Will" is forced into "get yourself together", "make it happen" and works against natural desire and motivation to express ourselves creatively. <br><br>We separate out a slave driver to make us do things we don't want to do. This forced will is working against yourself; is motivation by the whip (the slave driver) against other parts of yourself, endlessly pushing you toward a future which is assumed to be successful and achieving, but which is often disappointing and tiring because it doesn't address the need to release your potential to create and express, only the need to get concrete tangible stuff.<br><br>The essence of all dreams is surely the state of being it allows, not physical results.<br>The NOW is where natural desire, motivation and passion can unfold to being in this state.<br>The concensus says you are being stupid when you take this view, which erodes natural will.</div>

<div class="content">In _The Power of Habit_, Charles Duhigg discusses this at length, and even gets into the neurobiology of it.   <br><br>The basic premise is that one has a limited resource of willpower; you can only exert so much willpower before you get tired and have a harder time continuing to exercise willpower before one needs to rest and rejuvenate.   And there is a neurological basis for this.  Thus if one is faced with constant new decisions, constant new inputs that need processing, it can be very taxing and exhausting.   If one has to decide every day what to do when getting out of bed, you can start the day with a willpower deficit.   <br><br>In contrast, habits live in the basal ganglia, not in the cerebral cortex, so don't engage the neurological center of will.  Once they are triggered, they just follow their usual course, without an effort of will; in fact, it takes an effort of will to oppose it.   For example, establishing a morning routine that you always follow becomes a habit and does not require taxing your reserves of willpower.   <br><br>The book talks a lot about how to create regular habits for several purposes:<br>1. Changing your routine behavior to be healthier, happier, more productive, etc.<br>2. Identifying keystone habits - which tend to lead naturally to the development of other habits.   For example, for many people, establishing a habit of regular exercise leads to all kinds of other healthy behaviors, from diet to budgeting to being more able to handle respinsiblity in general.<br>3. The steps to follow to actually establish new habits effectively, and to replace undesirable habits.<br><br>One can create "pull" by establishing desirable habits and other supporting systems.  In this way, it does not require motivation to achieve the desired results.  When motivation appears, one can make use of it, but if one *depends* on motivation, one is constrained by the finite nature of willpower.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the book suggestion, Seraphim. I've downloaded a sample, and fear I might be spending $13 for the whole thing soon.<br><br>I actually visited the forum this morning because I've been slacking off in some of my daily habits related to productivity and exercise, and hoped to find some inspiration here. So this topic is apt. It seems right now that I *do* need willpower to re-establish and strengthen the good habits.<br><br>OK, back to work!</div>
