<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-01-27 22:26</div>
<div class="content">Hello All,<br><br>I am a Sales Professional and on the go - very mobile - taking lots of notes throughout the day. I have begun to use Autofocus, and do so by beginning from the front half of the book with my note-taking and starting from the back half of the book with my AF lists. I have not yet caught on with the Autofocus process though. I thought I understood it, but then used the demo PDF and saw the use of lines, and closed lists and didnt recall that from the initial instructions, so I'm still trying to figure it out. I have lots of tasks and lots of projects. <br><br>I'm reluctant to have separate AF lists for home, work, etc. Why is that necessary? I like it all in one place.<br><br>Also, should I be using AF2 or AF4?<br><br>Thanks in advance for your advice. Anyone else out there with lots of projects? They dont seem to fit as neatly in the AF system, but I may just need more practice.</div>

<div class="content">Suggest using AF4.  The PDF is connected to AF4.<br><br>You may have only one list if you like.  Many people would rather not consider "Clean Bedroom" when at the office.  This is especially an issue when it's time to dismiss a list because you took no action on it.  Do you really want to throw out your chores because you're in the wrong situation to do them?<br><br>Now if you are free to go home midday and tackle some chores, no problem.  Otherwise, one book two lists is the way to go.<br><br>If your projects require planning, keep the plans outside AF.  In AF put project tasks you plan to work on, or else just put "work on project X".</div>

<div class="content">Mark in Texas,<br><br>In my experience (with AF 4) I would agree with Alan's obserations. On the other hand one list can work if you can 'put time in' consistently (but not necessarily equal amounts) at both locations, otherwise I've found the open list gets longer and longer because you cannot adequately address the tasks in the closed list. I'd say, experiment and see what works for you. Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br><< Do you really want to throw out your chores because you're in the wrong situation to do them? >><br><br>Whatever form of AF you are using, you would have to have failed to do your chore for some time if were going to be dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">Mark in Texas:<br><br>Just to make the choice more difficult, I suggest AF3 with a tweak as described here:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/988459" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/988459</a><br><br>:-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark, if you have two locations, tasks on your closed list diminish over time, but eventually one place is done, and you must dismiss the tasks on that other place.  This must be true even if you don't neglect *any* of your commitments, unless you are able to switch contexts at that moment you return to the closed list.</div>

<div class="content">Alan<br><br>"eventually one place is done, and you must dismiss the tasks on that other place"<br><br>That can happen but it's far from always the case. If, say, you finish all your home chores in the closed list one evening, you can move on to the open list for any further home tasks you want to do. <br><br>Then the next day, you can work both the open and the closed list at work. Provided that you make sure that you finish your work either in the closed list or near the beginning of the open list, you will have all your home tasks available to you that evening.</div>

<div class="content">Doesn't this mean that from the point you finish all the closed home tasks, you only have an open list? So you can only ever close a list once before going to the other place? I can imagine that might be a problem for people who do mainly work during the week and home stuff at weekends, for example. <br><br>Unless I'm missing something, this looks like a strong argument for separate lists.</div>

<div class="content">I've tried it both ways.  I often work from home, and can take a break mid-day if needed to deal with some personal tasks, as long as I get my work done for the day or make up for it in the evening or on the weekend.  So it works great for me to have all my tasks grouped in one list.<br><br>But if work and personal were more segregated, like you are describing Will, (work during week, personal on the weekends), then it would make more sense to have two books.<br><br>I think that's pretty much what Mark has been saying all along...</div>

<div class="content">I must need more time to learn the process, or this is the onset of ADD, because I have a hard time following the responses above. <br><br>With any method it seems like the problems you had without one will continue once you try to implement one. Thus, I'm still struggling to look at my list often enough and havent yet grasped the significance of closed lists, drawing lines, etc. AF is a big list of stuff I dont have time to think about - much like my GTD lists were.<br><br>Thank you for your responses. I tried to decipher the "AF3 with a tweak" idea but it bewildered me even more. (Has anyone seen my left brain?)<br><br>I will keep plodding...</div>
