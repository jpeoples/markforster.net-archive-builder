<div class="content">Many of us have spent years on Mark's forum. So it wouldn't be a stretch to assume we'll be around (God Willing) in 2016. I think it would be interesting to tap into the power of accountability and use this forum to post our hopes/wishes/desires for 2015. What goals, self-improvement projects, etc are you hoping to tackle by 2016?<br><br>If more than two of you agree to engage in this process, I'll do the same.</div>

<div class="content">My first thought was a goal to settle on one system to keep track of my ideas and goals, but I realize that I probably won't do that. I recently make a list 3 goals for my personal life and 3 for my work life. <br><br>I have been watching this forum for years and have learned many things that I use everyday even without a goal in mind. Thank you all.</div>

<div class="content">My big goal is to get the first volume of a homeschool curriculum I'm writing published. I will be thrilled if I complete that goal. I have found that the more singular my focus, the more successful I am. While I would like to keep up with a decluttering/organizing calendar and finish some<br>scrapbooks, I will be satisfied with the one. How about you, Avrum?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim - due to my love of all things MS Excel, I call this "IF... THEN".  <br><br>IF I wake up in the morning (sure hope so!), write out the novel prompt for the day.  IF I don't get the novel outline prompt writing done during my morning commute, do it at lunch.  IF I have plans at lunch, do it first thing when I get home.  (Also have a Seinfeld "don't break the chain" in there).  That's what I'm doing for my January outline.  I've got a different process tagged for February - August for the actual writing.  And a different one for editing for Sep-Dec. <br><br>So yeah, that's my only goal this year that I'm not sure I can do/have never done before under regular circumstances - to write a novel that *I* think is good..</div>

<div class="content">I fluffed mine out a bit. <br><br>1.	Set up a system to organize my drawings, as they come in, in progress, scanned and shared.<br>2.	Make my site a showcase of my work including recent work, selected pieces and older work.<br>3.	Find new projects would benefit from simple sketches or how-to illustrations.</div>

<div class="content">Update re; The Elements of Focus course.<br><br>Shawn seems like a good guy. But I stopped watching after two videos. It all sounded VERY familiar. Also, if you're going to offer advice such as: "Lay out your clothes the night before", it's probably best to let people decide if it's worth their time. Claiming that this act is "...deeply profound", makes me think it isn't so. We rarely need to tell people something is profound when it is. <br><br>Also, when he wades into the marriage/parenting/relationship area... I think he's overreaching (a problem that many self-help authors fall victim to).<br><br>Which is why I still find Mark's ideas to be far more creative and helpful that the rest of the pack. They often feel fresh, well thought out and he lets the user decide if it's helpful or not. <br><br>Onwards...</div>

<div class="content">Mark - <br><br>I've always liked how you combine research in human behavior with your own experimentation.  Most time management books / systems are short on the research side.  They might craft a nice system that seems to have all the right features, and provide some insights and useful techniques - but really lacking on data to back up the principles espoused, which might account for their limited audiences / staying power.   GTD, 7 Habits, 12 Weeks, Michael Linenberger, all come to mind.<br><br>Your books don't always cite the research in great detail -- or at least I haven't noticed it.   But there are so many concepts built in there that sometimes seem counter-intuitive but have been proven through research to be effective.  Colley's Principle comes to mind.<br><br>One author that includes a lot of research is Charles Duhigg - The Power of Habit.  And he combines it with a practical method for establishing new habits.   Great book.<br><br>There are a lot of books that are somewhere in the middle.  Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's book on "Flow" is like that.   He starts with some very interesting research, and comes to some very valuable conclusions.   But then he spends the remaining 80% of the book extending the concepts into areas where they really aren't applicable, basically claiming that the "Flow" concept is the foundation the complete happiness of the human race.  (I don't think I am exaggerating!)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim - <br><br>My problem with research - particularly in the fields of mental health, social psychology and productivity - is that much of it is probably bunk. The problem is, do you have the background to suss out the good from the bad? Very few do.

I did find one study that suggests that for certain people, struggling with depression, self-help performs as well as therapy (I'm assuming CBT).

<div class="content">Seraphim, avrum:<br><br>My method has always been basically to try out ideas for myself (sometimes sparked off by other people's books/articles, sometimes not) and if they show promise to find ways to combine them with other things that work for me. I consider myself to be a fairly normal member of the human race and so what works for me should work for at least some other people. I try to avoid sounding like some form of holy writ as far as possible.<br><br>I'm usually pretty sensitive to when people are going way beyond the evidence (which in the case of governments is always), but claim no infallibility in this respect. However nothing in the "debunking" articles which avrum links to surprises me in the slightest.</div>

<div class="content"><<I consider myself to be a fairly normal member of the human race and so what works for me should work for at least some other people. >><br><br>Mark:<br><br>I think your work (and fans/followers) is a testament to the efficacy of your approach. <br><br>I wrote Learning to Commit - with Family Systems Theory as it's base - because it worked for me. And I figured, if so many other ideas/interventions didn't work (for me), then I have enough gumption to think others will benefit from this approach as well.</div>
