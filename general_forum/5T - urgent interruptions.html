<div class="content">How do you handle urgent interruptions in 5T?<br><br>Perhaps I should just throw away my current 5T list, and fill it back up again with the items that comprise the urgent interruption?<br><br>Any other ideas?</div>

<div class="content">The system I am using is 5Ux which you can find in the discussion forums. As I wrote there:<br><br>"The system is a list of five tasks plus a reserved slot for any urgent task that comes. Therefore, you can have theoretically up to six tasks at a time, but that is not the "natural" state of the system; ideally, it should only have five.  Also, once you have six items already on the list and another urgent matter comes, if you want to tackle that new urgent matter using the system, you have to cross out one of the tasks in the list and write the new urgent task down so that the total never goes above six items."</div>

<div class="content">Hi nuntym,<br><br>This sounds like a reasonable approach, but I'm wondering if anyone has found a way to do it without changing the basic rules of 5T / implementing a hack like this.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I'd add it to a dynamic list and pick it up on the next pass of the 5T list.<br><br>If it couldn't wait, I'd add it to the 5T list.<br><br>Not sure whether to:<br>- allow the 5T list to grow<br>- strike out a task to pick up on the next pass or<br>- cut the list down to 2 and add the urgent task + 2 others<br><br>All this is theoretical. In practice, I'd probably step outside the system.<br><br>I'm very interested in Mark's response.</div>

<div class="content">LOL<br><br>Nike.<br><br>So basically it's the advice Mark has been giving since the beginning of the AF's.<br><br>Just do it.  <br><br>I mean you have the 5T list to remind you what you have been doing before the interruption.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I missed something in your original post. "fill it back up again with the items that comprise the urgent interruption".<br><br>Wouldn't the individual items go on a dynamic list?</div>

<div class="content">"Nike" makes sense for a single short interruption.<br><br>But in practice, for me at least, urgent stuff comes in batches.   So trying to apply "Nike" quickly turns into "winging it".   And that leads to me getting disoriented, like a "deer in the headlights".   <br><br>After giving this more thought, I think a new batch of urgent tasks comprises a change in circumstances."  <br><br>So I think I will just invoke this 5T rule: "You can also start a fresh list any time that you feel that a change in circumstances has made your current list inappropriate."</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>If you are getting plagued by a batch of urgent tasks, then I suggest you drop 5T altogether and adopt the emergency procedure described in Get Everything Done.<br><br>This consists of the following procedure:<br><br>List all the tasks<br><br>Grade them: as follows: <br><br>A - Must be done today <br>B - Should be done today <br>C - Could be done today<br><br>You may need to select a shorter time period than today, e.g. before the conference this afternoon.<br><br>Do the A's straight off.<br>Feed the B's into 5T during the course of the day<br>Leave the C's until things have settled down again.</div>
