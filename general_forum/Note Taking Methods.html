<div class="content">(Copied from Blog Comments - MF)<br><br>Seeing as you're talking about set-up, I'm in a personal debate, which to use as a note taking method? The camp is divided on the new TEUXDEUX pitted against ANY.DO I was using TASKPAPER for all of Marks iterations and methods. except that it doesn't deal well with tasks that really need dates assigned. Which is where Teuxdeux excels, plain lists against a simple calender, is just about perfect.<br>I tried for a while to not apply dates to tasks- by re-defining the tasks and the questions over them - but ended up in the conclusion that my definition of task was askew. A task 'starts at the start - is worked on - & is finished when finished' is my current reckoning, so as soon as I need to apply a date to anything in my TUTMS, it's ripped off the list into the calender. It's my way of acknowledging a commitment over a goal/task (and gets me through lists faster!).<br>But then Any.do has its "moment" feature and a nice way to maintain lists *and* a schedule with the same task set!<br>both let me do a dictation to generate a new task, which as a farmer, is my best input method (dont ask what my hands are covered in!:) I input my task into 'today' (the quickest entry) and then shift them to my new list the next morning with the any.do 'moment' - its amazing how often what i thought was a task, wasn't. A few hours to vet the consequences and definition of tasks is gaining importance with me!<br>Thanks to Mark for your work in this field. I struggled for such a long time to discipline to any old "priority" markers, it so regularly does not apply when I'm working *with and in* the fickle outdoors environment - 'humble-me' assigning priorites on nature? (laughs!)<br>All of these methods have been far superior in managing not only myself, but my other labour resources too!<br>Is anyone able to offer a opinion on my two options?<br>July 16, 2013 at 2:25 | Unregistered CommenterWade (wade@humblehouse.biz)</div>

<div class="content">Wade:<br><br>"Is anyone able to offer an opinion on my two options?"<br><br><br>... Yes. I have tested Any.Do and TeuxDeux with enough list-setup scenarios and tasks to break them both. In the words of renowned philosopher and poet Charlie Sheen, TeuxDeux is "Winning". <br><br>Compared to TeuxDeux's first release, the new website and app are cheetah-fast, reliable, customizable, and intuitive. TeuxDeux now has recurring tasks, clickable links, and endless customizable drag-and-drop task lists. <br><br>You can use top or bottom lists for most of Mark's systems, including DIT and AF4R. Other bottom list creative uses:<br><br>• Kanban/Sprint Boards<br>• Values Lists<br>• Habit Lists<br>• Routine Checklists<br>• Capture lists for each area of your life or roles<br>• Monthly and Weekly Lists<br>• Reference Lists<br>• Contact Lists<br>• Conversation Plans/Notes<br>• Logs<br>• Short Notes<br>• Idea Lists<br>• Expense Lists<br>• Project/Outcome/Result/Target/Goal Lists<br>• Blank lists to add visual separation between lists<br>• Personal and Professional Lists<br>• Location-Based Lists (Work, Home)<br>• Or use a list under the current day for should or could dos and the top list for must dos<br><br>It's your calendar and lists at-a-glance in a stylish, minimalist paper-like digital app.</div>

<div class="content">Why thanks Michael!<br>I've gained some vision on using those free form lists, appreciated. even the logging of done items in a very crude way is really useful in Teuxdeux. I've referred back many times now and got a date against the task, Any.do doesn't let me do that very well.<br>I used to use taskpaper a lot, but the formatting options requiring the user are less onerous in teuxdeux!! <br>Your right, with more days at the coalface of this dilemma, That minimal, designy to-do app is winning (and yes it is FAST!).</div>
