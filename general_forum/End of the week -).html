<div class="content">Well firstly apologies for the title to all in the US and further West who are still slogging through Friday (or flying through it with AF?) but here in the UK my working week is done so I thought I should take time to give some feedback on the system!  I don't think I have anything radical to add but I guess as a 'beta tester' it would be good to let you know how I'm getting on.<br><br>I work in software and my experience of beta testers is that they only get in touch if there's a problem - well, not so here.<br><br>I didn't get going until Tuesday so I've worked with AF for four days now.  I had initial anxieties about 'important' tasks getting lost in there and about only doing a bit of something with a deadline and then it slipping to the bottom of this list but they have proved unfounded.<br><br>Quite a lot of my more urgent work arrives in the form of email so I spend blocks of time working on that and go back to my AF list at other times.  The astounding thing for me is how it has helped me get on with important things that I usually make such a meal of - doing a bit, wandering off for a cuppa, finding some busy work to do instead, doing a bit more, etc.  There were a few of these tasks on my first page and I found that:<br>a) I couldn't with any integrity skip over them when going through the list, and<br>b) once I'd got going on them I just wanted to complete them since I was anxious about them going to the back of the list!  (Obviously these weren't massive tasks but were things taking a couple of hours.)<br>This has meant it took me three days to get off page 1 but I shifted some real nasties.<br><br>And, my boss commented on how intensely I've been working!  Good except it makes me wonder what he thought beforehand ;-)<br><br>Now I'm looking forward to next week as the system starts to settle down. <br><br>I'm going to have a go at a home list this evening.  I was resisting this because I have what I think of as a good home system - but then yesterday I had some time and I was paralyzed about what to do next because there seemed to be so many possibilities  and I ended up doing nothing - and I thought I why aren't I trying AF at home?  So, here goes.<br><br>Good luck to everyone and thanks Mark,<br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Lucy. That's very encouraging. Good luck with the home list!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Lucy - you have inspired me to create a home list now! Next week I will add some more tasks to my work list/<br><br>Unfortunately quite often I tend to work 'in my head' i.e. react to things which means I forget about some things - this has been the case this week. I will have a go next week to try to put down all the tasks and try to get some ticked off!</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br><br>Well, almost three weeks further on and the system is great at work.  I've been really productive and much more focused.  Also I find I can keep my concentration for much longer periods of time.  I haven't quite finished any pages yet but I'm very close on a few which is further motivation to keep moving!  I think it has been slow to get into because, like other people have commented, there were quite a few larger long-outstanding tasks in the early pages which once I started I just wanted to complete.  I'm finding more recent pages have more momentum.<br><br>So, works great for work but AF at home just isn't happening for me.  I am really, really resisting it - I avoid even opening the notebook!  But I don't want to give up so I've been reading around the forum and found a few ideas to try.<br><br>I read a comment from Mark that said when you do something other than open the notebook, add that activity to the end of the list.  I'll try that as well as generally adding more 'treat' tasks in there.  <br><br>Also, my home notebook only has 17 lines per page and I'm wondering whether that's part of the problem.  I think I might be less overwhelmed with less but longer pages?  My work book has 22 - only a few more but it's a completely different beast.  Might try a similar book at home.<br><br>I think mainly I just need to work the system at home instead of thinking about it.  I keep worrying whether various things are on the list (I know, just add them) and then that I can't trust the system.  Why is this?  I trust it at work where it really matters if I don't do certain things.  Whereas nobody will even know if I don't do X domestic chore or read Y book that has caught my interest.  Hmmm ...<br><br>Anyway, apologies for a bit of a brain dump but I'm hoping it gives me a bit more clarity.  I was excited about seeing the great results I've seen at work at home too and I don't want to give up on that yet.<br><br>Any other procrastination tips welcome!  Well, I mean anti-procrastination of course - I can do procrastination with the best of them ;-)<br><br>Best wishes<br>Lucy<br></div>

<div class="content">Lucy<br><br>I can totally relate to this - I have exactly the same experience.<br><br>For me, I think this is not so much a fault in AF, more that I just do not have very much discretionary time. With 3 young children, the only time I have time to even look at my home AF list is after 8.30pm.<br><br>By then, my energy levels are so low I rarely feel like doing anything. Having said that I do keep the list going and have had some success (notably backing up my photo collection).<br><br>However, this is not a new issue – it existed for me prior to AF. I would get to 8.30pm and, despite my best intentions, would rarely get much done other than reading a book or watching TV.<br><br>I wonder if this is partly about being realistic and maybe the answer is to get into the habit of at least reviewing the list, even if it means dismissing items on the basis that if I can’t muster the energy to do anything on a page then maybe those things aren’t actually that important.<br><br>Mark suggested to me to try and include lots of fun things. I have done this, including putting some “habits” on there as these are quick wins that I know will get done. So I have items such as “Read book”, “Watch DVD” along with “Daily stretches”. I know I will always do my “Daily stretches” (I am a runner) as it is already an ingrained habit when I get dressed in the morning but at least it gives me a “win” every time I review the list.<br><br>Regards,<br>Andy<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Lucy<br><br>Just a thought, and I have no idea if it will work, but could you try reading through your home lists at work when you are in AF mode to see if that kick starts it for you.  I have everything in one list which makes it easier but sometimes if I am away from home and review my lists and see a task that I want to do, somehow that gives me more motivation to do it when I do get home.<br><br>Also, put a few really small items on the list, e.g. make coffee, put slippers on, etc.  having a few items to tick off starts the momentum going.  Tesco do a great notebook for AF - in their Extra Special range (called an Executive Notebook) which comes in A4 (£4.00) & A5 (£2.50).  I use the A4 at home for everything and the A5 for travel to record thoughts and ideas as required and then transfer it to the A4.<br><br>It is hard to get going in the evening after a long day - the advantage (?) of working at home with AF is that it is a lot easier to keep going - too easy sometimes!!</div>

<div class="content">OFF TOPIC - but I have a tip about this for other working moms (or could be dads too).  This works amazingly well for me.<br><br>It's audiobooks!  I usually have one going at all times.  Usually fiction.  When I've worked all day, cooked and put kids to bed, I swear that I sometimes see cleaning the kitchen as a treat because I can't wait to get back to my 'book',  I use this for all physical mundane housework.  But it doesn't work for things that need my concentration.</div>

<div class="content">I use audiobooks too.  I have had the same experience -- looking forward to mindless tasks so I can listen to an audiobook (or a folder full of podcasts).</div>

<div class="content">Now, audiobooks to accompany those boring tasks sounds like a good idea.  I use audiobooks to relax with so this sounds great to me - they could help me relax while doing housework, rather than feeling bored and wound up.  Thanks for that idea.</div>

<div class="content">Being the contrarian that I am ;-)<br><br>Another approach to the mindless and boring is to embrace it and make it a mindfulness meditation.  I used to jog in the mornings and would be plugged into a Walkman (remember those, way back when?)  I realized that I was wasting valuable meditation time and I followed the advice of some meditation writers and focused on being in the moment and experiencing each step and breath ... etc.  It made all the difference to me.<br><br>But I acknowledge that this also might be an issue of personality as well.  Just a thought.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi there<br><br>Good thinking Andy - I've added lots more things to my list, habitual things and fun things, and I am finding much less resistance to it.<br><br>I've also moved to a bigger book which I'm more comfortable with.<br><br>As for you Christine - that was a truly inspired idea!  It kind of primes me for getting home from work and gets me past that half hour post work when I just feel tired and like I don't want to do anything.  As long as I get going on something I usually find that I then become enthused to do a lot more :-)<br><br>I'm listening to the Alexander McCall Smith online novel, Corduroy Mansions, at the moment.  I've got lots to catch up on so I'm looking forward to my mindless tasks this weekend :-)  I also love audiobooks for long drives.<br><br>Thanks all<br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lucy<br><br>I'm really glad that worked for you - it certainly is easier to keep going once you start on something it but getting started is not always easy!  Hope it all continues to go well for you this weekend - enjoy the novel!</div>
