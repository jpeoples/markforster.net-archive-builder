<div class="content">hi all,<br><br>I'm rereading DIT and starting to use it for handling my workload.  I do have a question though.  <br><br>I have my daily checklist list and my on-off list for tomorrow.  I should be saving up emails to do as part of my daily list, along with voicemails, etc.<br><br>Say I've been waiting for an email from John with information in order to call a client and give them the information. I get that email at the end of the day and save it in my email in order to work on as part of my daily list tomorrow.<br><br>Tomorrow comes and I'm working through email and come across this email from John.  I then call my client and tell them the information I received in the email.<br><br>Is this correct according to DIT?  Or, should I add the phone call to my tomorrow list when the email comes in at the end of the day?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>brett</div>

<div class="content">If I can deal with something quickly then I just deal with it.   If it requires more thought or research or a lengthy reply, then I'll push it to my "tomorrow" list.</div>

<div class="content">brettypooh:<br><br>You basically have three choices:<br><br>1. You can call the client as part of actioning your email. As Seraphim says you would usually only do this if it is quick and easy to do it straight away.<br><br>2. You can make calling the client a separate task which you put on your list for tomorrow.<br><br>3. You can make calling the client a "same day" task which goes "below the line" on today's list. You should only do this if there would be a significant downside to leaving it to tomorrow.</div>
