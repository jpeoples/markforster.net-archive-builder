<div class="content">Hi I am currently using Dynalist for Mark’s FVP system. Dynalist works well for this in my experience but I am wondering if anyone has set up Obsidian for the same purpose. As I am sure some you know Obsidian is made by the same developers but works on local markdown files and as a note taking app it seems to be quite at the forefront of ‘linked thinking’ note taking apps which I am quite interested in, I suppose I am hoping that I might be able to consolidate my app usage to a fewer amount of apps. Also Dynalist feels quite clunky on IOS! Really enjoying this forum and Marks ideas are just great as is the community around them, thanks in advance</div>

<div class="content">No.<br>I’ve tried Dynalist, ListPro, HanDBase, Workflowy, Carbonfin Outliner, My Life Organised, EssentialPim, Trello, AnyList, Google Tasks, Remember The Milk, Task Coach, Informant, Any.do, 2do, Microsoft Todo, Onlinelistmaster, Apple Notes, Apple Reminders, Evernote, OneNote, Leadertask, Notion, Google Keep, Toodledo, SwiftoDo, OmniFocus, Todoist, TickTick, and Pomodoro.<br>But I’ve not tried Obsidian. Maybe when the iOS app is out of beta.</div>

<div class="content">Obsidian is great for note-taking and creating rapid links among notes. For FVP, I think it could work just fine, maybe with use of boldface font for dotted tasks. You can then link the items in the task list with notes using the Obsidian hyperlink notation. Could work very nicely!</div>

<div class="content">You should definitely try Zim-Wiki. See https://zim-wiki.org/ and https://github.com/zim-desktop-wiki/zim-desktop-wiki/. It's quite similar to Obsidian, but faster and more mature.<br><br>I have a dedicated page for a FVP master list. Each entry has a checkbox that can have 3 states (indicated either by a checkmark, cross or arrow forward). For dotting I use "arrow forward". For placing existing tasks to the bottom I either copy and paste them, or use the "Line Sorter" Plugin, to move them down, line by line, with a keyboard shortcut, see https://zim-wiki.org/manual/Plugins/Line_Sorter.html. This is a default plugin that you have to enable in "Options > Plugins", if not enabled already.<br><br>For complex projects I link tasks from the master list to another page with detailed step-by-step tasks. This keeps the master list decluttered.<br><br>All content is stored in plain text files and can be easily read and manipulated by other apps. My preference on Android is Markor. See https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gsantner.markor and https://github.com/gsantner/markor. Don't forget to select the Zim-Wiki format, when reading Zim-Wiki pages in Markor.<br><br>Enjoy!</div>

<div class="content">Ged,<br><br>Firstly, I forgot to list Checkvist.<br><br>As for the best one, if I could divest myself of my craving for a mobile (ios) version, and possibly my hatred of workarounds, I would most likely settle on the one you're using currently, Dynalist, but the fact that you can't duplicate items on the otherwise excellent mobile version is enough to put me off. I also love My Life Organised, and do use it for non-discretionary items, for which it excellent, and I would use it for FVP, Autofocus or the like, but again the mobile version doesn't quite cut it for me.<br><br>The one I WAS using very happily was the system I write about in this thread:<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2770698#post2770729" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2770698#post2770729</a><br><br>But unfortunately the ios version (Swiftodo), has become buggy very recently after the latest ios update, or possibly something Dropbox have done. However, as with much "Donationware", the developer is very much on the ball and I'm confident he will restore usability very soon. Until then I am a bit of a lost soul in terms of digital solutions and can't quite bring myself to forgo the features that apps provide and revert to pen and paper.<br><br>I would also mention Notion in dispatches. Some overhead and learning curve involved to set up an FVP system and if only I wasn't so pernickety as to object to it adding "Copy of" to copied items it would be perfect. Actually, reading that back, I think I've just persuaded myself to ignore that plaint and give it another try.</div>

<div class="content">The Mac Power Users podcast has devoted some recent episodes to Obsidian and other personal knowledge management apps, and there are good tips there on how to use it (and why the hosts prefer it over Roam). Co-host David Sparks is a lawyer and is using Obsidian to manage the info related to his cases.<br><br>However, they're using Obsidian exclusively for PKM, notes, etc., not for task mgmt. They prefer dedicated task mgmt apps (like Omnifocus). <br><br>I've spent so much time and money over the years on applications going back to Lotus Agenda for DOS and Ecco (old-timers from the late '90s will remember those) that I'm doing an apps fast right now. Just using what I already have (Apple Notes, Evernote, pen and paper); my life is really not that complicated, my ego just likes to think it is. <br><br>It was always (and still is) fun to try out new apps and see how they work; I always enjoy hearing how members of this forum are finding ways to digitize Mark's systems.</div>

<div class="content">IF you haven't tried workflowy in a while, you may want to check it out. They have added dates, mirroring and backlinks. Mirroring is great to keep an FVP list and then making new dynamic lists along the way, info will be updated in all places.<br><br>Backlinks work well for project management. You can link any task to a project node and it shows the date and the lists they are in from the project node. They are also built on mirrors so updating in one place allows it to update everywhere.<br><br>I am using pen and paper these days for actions and workflowy for reference, but I love these features for both tasks and reference.</div>

<div class="content">Mike Brown:<br><br><< I've spent so much time and money over the years on applications>><br><br>I hear ya brother. <br><br>A couple of years ago - when my entire workflow system centered around journaling (and still does) - I needed some way to track niggly tasks, reminders, etc. Purchasing an Apple Watch coupled with SIRI led to my decision to take full advantage of Apple's Reminders. It works wonderfully. Example:<br><br>"Hey dad, don't forget I need stamps for school tomorrow."<br><br>Me: "Hey Siri, remind me to pick up stamps at 8pm tonight".<br><br>Cj Chilvers does an excellent job describing why this simple solution works so bloody well:<br>https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/my-adhd-wearable</div>

<div class="content">I read this discussion with interest, and even came across a few apps mentioned which I'd never heard of. Funnily enough, I'd been having a look at Obsidian just about the time Ged made his first post in this thread.<br><br>I use apps for just about everything in my life - except for time management. Electronic time management is just too fiddly for me. What's more, it tempts people into over-designing their time management methods. <br><br>When I want to do a task, say "Tax Return", I just want to write Tax Return at the end of a list without colour coding it, highlighting it, linking it, adding a tick box, prioritising it, marking it up, or any of the myriad other things which electronic methods encourage one to do.<br><br>I quite often get asked how I manage to do so many tasks during a day, and part of my answer is that the system itself must take the minimum of time and the minimum of thought. Not being electronic is a major part of that.<br><br>For example take Ian S's post:<br><br>"I’ve tried Dynalist, ListPro, HanDBase, Workflowy, Carbonfin Outliner, My Life Organised, EssentialPim, Trello, AnyList, Google Tasks, Remember The Milk, Task Coach, Informant, Any.do, 2do, Microsoft Todo, Onlinelistmaster, Apple Notes, Apple Reminders, Evernote, OneNote, Leadertask, Notion, Google Keep, Toodledo, SwiftoDo, OmniFocus, Todoist, TickTick, and Pomodoro."<br><br>I'm not getting at Ian, I've been guilty of the same thing myself, but just think of the amount of productive work he could have done in the time which he spent testing all these apps out.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><<just think of the amount of productive work he could have done in the time which he spent testing all these apps out.>><br><br>I've tried it all as well... including paper/pen (I have fond memories of doing AF and DWM). But my experience is that productive work - however one defines it - is a complex mix of variable that far exceeds the meaning of any tool. <br><br>Take David Sparks... a cursory look at his work background would suggest he's primed to do a lot of things, and quite well. A lawyer, an author (many times over), a podcaster, an online trainer, a musician... the mistake some people make is thinking that Obsidian (or Omnifocus) make the man. I'd wager Sparks - even as a young man, was very driven. He simply likes to tinker with gear. And as David Allen is fond of saying: There are worse ways to waste one's time.</div>

<div class="content">I like keeping things simple.  Which is why I am disposed to using exactly one tool for self-organization.  In my case, DynaList.  It doesn't do everything, but it has enough power and I adapt my work management to fit the tool.  This of course only makes sense when the tool is close to how you want to work anyway.  Before DynaList the best option I didn't really have a satisfactory solution.</div>

<div class="content">Really excellent comments and insights here. I think I will probably stick with Dynalist for now Paper and pen is excellent no doubt .. tried it many many times. I think perhaps that the ability to link to project files directly from my FVP list (from within Dynalist’ and the ease with which one can structure ones own lists within Dynalist means that I will stay mainly digital for now. For sure I have been ‘over tooled’ in the past! At the moment I am using Dynalist for 2 FVP lists (one for work one for personal) and then each day the chain I select feeds a short pen and paper daily list. Best of both worlds hopefully. Let’s see!<br><br>Alan would be curious to hear more about out you structure your Dynalist and any particular tips! I’m still relatively a newbie with the program. <br><br>What a great community and forum this is. Thanks again for the advice</div>

<div class="content">I found this old thread because it is suddenly very relevant to me. I've been a Dynalist user for years, but I've left it and now I'm all in on Obsidian.  I don't use it as a Zettlekasten in the purist sense but the ability to easily create and  relate note files is amazing. <br><br>Here is how I've been using it with FVP principles  and sometimes randomization..  I create  a separate note file for each project. I also have a note file  for each person I regularly  meet with.  Obsidian excels at linking notes together with hyperlinks so I can easily link project files with people files. My job as an IT manager is to work with people and projects.  For the one-off tasks that only I can do, I put those  in a note file with my name as the file name.   I currently have about 50  active people and project note files for work. <br><br>The way Obsidian displays the list of files makes it easy to read through the file names like a list. All the files are listed vertically down the left side  in the app.  Obsidian allows you to sort this "list" by last modified date. Keeping the oldest modified file on top ensures that I don't let any project or person go too long before checking  in on it/them.   I can treat this list of files like a FVP list.  The way I select the file is to simply open it and it opens a tab within Obsidian. I make sure I right click and chose "open in new tab".  <br><br>Per the FVP rules the first item on the list is always selected first so this is my oldest file. (I only do this in my "active files" folder.)  The opened files open as tabs horizontally across the top in Obsidian. Sort of like a web browser.  In FVP fashion, I can keep going down the list asking the question and open the file that I want to work on  before the last selected file.  Then per the FVP rules,  I can then work the tabs  right to left once I have all the selected files open.  Right to left is because these tabs stack horizontally as I open them.    To show I  actioned something about the project or person file,  I simply update the file with a relevant note.   Then I can close it.  This effectively moves the file to the bottom of the list because it now has the most recent modified date.  If the project is done, I can delete the file entirely or move it to another  folder.  I only use FVP on the "active files" folder.  Within each note file I often have a list there as well but I usually use my intuition on the tasks that might be within the file. <br><br>I suspect you could do this method with any text editor and a filing system but the <br>Obsidian app has a nice layout that seems to keep it all together nicely  and I'm really becoming quite fond of markdown syntax.  Obsidian also  has a cool open random note feature that I often use when I'm feeling indecisive.</div>

<div class="content">Very neat use of obsidian, Brent. I am a family as well, but never was able to get a workflow that stuck with it. <br><br>I see that you were using Dynalist, I switched back to Workflowy a little over a month ago and have been so happy with it. They really added and are continuing to add pretty quickly great quality of life and feature improvements, including sorting of bullets. Although they still cannot sort by modify date, I can put a date tag and sort by that. Work Flowy has had backlinks and "mirroring" which allows you to put the same item in different spots. A task in a FV list and also keep it in a project list, for example. And checking it off in one place checks it off in all places. Not recommending you go to Work Flowy particularly if you found a way to get Obsidian to work for you. But I guess I'm just mentioning this because I'm really impressed with its latest changes and have been pretty happy with my workflow these days. <br><br><br>Also happy to see some activity on the site. I miss Mark and all the comments and ideas from this group.</div>

<div class="content">I was notified this thread had picked back up and thought I'd share an update. I've been using Obsidian for 4 years now and followed Mark's blog pretty closely when I was still working. After retiring, my task list changed dramatically - fewer urgent priorities - so I drifted away from this blog and FVP.<br><br>The recent comment got me to revisit the system. I needed a reminder of how things worked so I gathered all of Mark's rules, FAQs, and answers to questions and had Claude (AI) create a summary for me. That's when I caught a mistake I'd been making: I was asking "what do I want to do more than X?" instead of "what do I want to do before X?" <br><br>That small change (of course) has made a big difference. Now with the correct question and my Obsidian experience, FVP feels productive and engaging again. With Obsidian, marking tasks and moving through the list is quick and easy. The combination works well for my current retired-life task list, which still gets surprisingly long despite the different pace.</div>

<div class="content">@vegheadjones Good to hear from you again.  Sounds like Workflowy seems to have continued to improve since I last used it.  I think Workflowy would be the winner if I ever return to an "outliner".  For now I've really enjoyed thinking and working in more of a long form narrative way rather than bullet points and lists.  Obsidian's note structure has encouraged me to write more.  In a way it has been like Mark's "Dreams" book where he basically had conversations with himself through writing.  As I've been writing narratives that mostly documents  my projects, I'm finding a lot of clarity on some previously stuck, blocked or stagnant projects.  An added benefit is that the more I have documented some of the stuff I do, the more easily I've been able to hand of things  to other team members.  My Dynalist lists were getting pretty brief and cryptic.  So the change has been good for me.</div>
