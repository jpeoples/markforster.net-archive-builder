<div class="content">+ JMJ +<br><br>Months of using MFME showed me an interesting way of minimizing dependence on a list, at least if you are using your list more at home: make a habit of going around the house to pick up visual cues on what to do next. <br><br>I mean really, do I need to write "laundry" in my list to remind myself to do it, when I could have just looked at the overflowing hamper? :)</div>

<div class="content">I started that a few weeks ago, but I'm in one of those phases when nothing seems to stick. It worked well for the few days it was new, and still works for the two rooms that became routine.<br><br>A variation is pick a room and work in it for five or fifteen minutes. Set a timer. It's amazing how many things you put on your list last decade so you wouldn't forget them, and the subsequently ignored, get done that way. My problem is picking which room and how long. Wrong answer: Can't decide so spin wheels. Correct answer: Pick room that feels right, or at random, five minutes unless there's daily or weekly work due, in which case 15 minutes.</div>
