<div class="content">Yesterday afternoon a thunderstorm with  heavy rainfall flooded several rooms at the office where I work. Had to deal with this event immediately and I abandoned my AF list for the rest of the work day.<br><br>Do these kinds of events change anything about how you work with AF2? Of course, if it has to be done at once, then do it at once, as in AF1, but is there anything else I should consider?</div>

<div class="content">That scenario sounds familiar. Do you live in Baden-Württemberg? The Stuttgart Media University was flooded too: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9rN4ydpu98" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9rN4ydpu98</a><br><br>I think such a situation is a perfectly valid reason to abandon the AF list. You could put "deal with flood" at the end of your list and then work on that for the rest of your day, but I don't really see the point. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">One thing: I wouldn't count that day against the dismissal rules of AF2.</div>
