<div class="content">My reaction to his quoted statement: He's half-right.  Civilization advances by increasing the number and quality of things  that can be done without thought... only by applying thought to things that you are doing with an object of improving them.</div>

<div class="content">Since the quote appears in the "To Think About..." spot which is changed regularly, I'd better copy it so others know what Alan is referring to:<br><br>"It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them." Alfred North Whitehead<br><br>I think Alan's point is actually what Whitehead meant. To put the quote in context, it's from his "An Introduction to Mathematics" (1911) and he says elsewhere in the same chapter: "By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the race."<br><br>And no, I haven't read the book!</div>

<div class="content">It also applies to music notation. I mark theory books for a kids' choir. All the smart ones ask why we don't just letter the 12 notes ABCDEFGHIJKL, and why we always put the sharps and flats in the same illogical order, and why the 4th sharp goes on the line rather than the space lower down, and why they have to put the strokes / counts directly over / under the notes.<br><br>I tell them it's tradition, and it's also part of a bigger pattern, then show them some truly nasty piano pieces. "Our accompanist can sight-read this because it follows the patterns he's used to."</div>
