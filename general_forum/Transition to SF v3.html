<div class="content">Existing AF pages can't be used well with SF because it expects the second column to be mostly empty.  Plus, SFv3 insists a full page must be dismissed immediately.  So what's a good way to get started?  <br><br>I created an active task "Grab stuff from old list".  The effect is a little bit of ping-ponging.  Each time I advance to the next SF page, I do the task "grab stuff from old list", scan the old list for something else that needs doing, then return to the SF page, work through it, and move on.<br><br>At the moment I each time pick something that ought to be done now and put it into the action immediately.  Maybe later I'll pick things for the end of the SF list instead.  <br><br>(In my peculiar case, I also happened to have 4 half-full pages which I grabbed to jumpstart the process.)</div>

<div class="content">I'm doing something very similar.  <br><br>I started a new list for SAF.<br><br>I entered an item, "Few items from old list", that I regard as "recurring" rather than "unfinished".  <br><br>I am wondering whether your approach -- treating it as unfinished -- will be more effective than my approach -- treating it as recurring.<br><br>Treating it as unfinished would certainly process the old list faster, and get it into the SAF list quicker.  But that's a little daunting for me -- I'm not sure I WANT to get all that old stuff into my list faster.   <br><br>Hm, here's what I think I'll do.  I'll change it to an unfinished task, "transfer all important tasks from old SAF book".   After I process the "important" stuff, I can figure out what to do with the rest of it at that point.  (Probably just dismiss the lot.)</div>

<div class="content">" Plus, SFv3 insists a full page must be dismissed immediately"<br><br>Only if the 2nd column is full, right? If the 1st column is full, you can just do one task from it and keep the page active like always.<br><br>Of course, if you've written many tasks out to the far righthand edge of the page (somehow i do this all the time), then there may not be space in a typical AF1 page for a 2nd column, which indeed makes the switch a little dicey. <br><br>But nonetheless this should only be a temporary problem.</div>

<div class="content">OhNine: I typically use 8.5x11" paper and write tasks down two columns.  So SF won't accept these pages.</div>

<div class="content">When I discovered a few weeks ago that SuperFocus would require a 'Column 2' I started using only the right-hand side of my notebook to enter tasks, leaving the left-hand page blank, and now I use that for SuperFocus's column 2.<br><br>My notebook is approximately A6 size and has 18 lines per page, but I draw a vertical line to divide it into two columns and I therefore get 36 tasks on the right-hand page , and the left-hand page (column 2)  can potentially take 36 tasks.  I think this will work well.</div>

<div class="content">If you have problems with getting the 2nd columns into your notebook, you can do without them: Just have two separate sheets of paper in addition to your notebook. One is called "urgent", the other one is called "unfinished". Then work through your notebook in the normal way, using the urgent list in addition as the second column of the current page. Whenever something from the page or from the urgent list is done but not finished, put it on the unfinished list. Whenever something urgent comes to your mind, put it on the urgent list. If the urgent list is completely done, go to the next page in the notebook and swap the lists: urgent (which is now empty, i.e. all the items are crossed out) becomes the unfinished list, and the unfinished list (which contains the unfinished tasks from the previous page) becomes now the urgent list. Then work on the current page and the urgent list as before.<br><br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">My own recommendation would be to start a new list, and just add things as you think of them or as they come up. This works on the basis that, if you never think of something and neither does anyone else, it's not likely to be very important!</div>

<div class="content">Will:<br><< I'm using Outlook tasks, with column 2 tasks flagged as low priority, and "pages" grouped by due date. >><br><br>Will - I'm also using Outlook tasks but I've set up categories for AF to simulate pages (AF-1, AF-2, etc.).  That also allows the lists to sync nicely with Toodledo (I'm currently using stars to mark the urgent items (right side) of the lists.  I've written a few macros in Outlook to automate the process of adding urgent items to my current page, as well as automating the process of moving unfinished items to the next page, marking them as urgent (starred).<br><br>How and why are you using due dates to group pages and how do you differentiate those items from items that are ACTUALLY due today?</div>

<div class="content">Mark: that may work if you're not running a business where customer satisfaction is based on you remembering to do for them what you promised!  Those promises are recorded in the old list so I can't drop them.</div>

<div class="content">Yes all my short-term commitments are exclusively tracked in the list.    Pre-AF, I have no idea how that would have managed, but currently there isn't much need to go beyond.  In fact, it would seem like unnecessary overhead to have another place that tracks this.</div>

<div class="content">Are you gusy keeping work and home seperate or together in one list?  I'm not sure if this new version works better with everything in it, or just focusing on one thing.  <br><br>I work from home mostly, and am wary of taking my focus off work during the day (I don't often need much of an excuse!) however I also have a tendancy to sit for too long so having other tasks in the mix may make me get up and do something else occasionally which could be good for my health!!</div>

<div class="content">Mark wrote:<br><<<I don't think I would ever have relied on just my time management list to keep track of the commitments I'd made to clients.>>><br><br>For the work side of the things, yes Mark that's true.  The teams that I run have Action Item lists and quarterly deliverables that we track in every meeting.  Usually my SAF list only points me to review those lists, and maybe copy a few of my own action items to my list.<br><br>But for home, I don't have action item lists and deliverable lists that I review with my wife and children.   (Maybe I should!!)   These kinds of items just go into my AF list -- where often they get neglected, but at least I know they will get some kind of attention, sometime.  (With SAF hopefully better and sooner!!)   I usually write my wife's name all the way to the right-hand margin next to each of these tasks, so I can scan for them when she and I are discussing things.<br><br>I could rewrite a list of all these items separately, and review that separate list with her, and copy my own tasks back into SAF -- but it's a pain to do all that by hand.   For work items, it's all on the computer so it's easy.   But pulling out my laptop to discuss our plans for the garden and the children's schoolwork and the broken telephone line and who's going to take my son to football practice and my daughter to her college class, and whatever else, seems like overkill.   Plus, we just don't have the systems in place to make that effective (and since my wife doesn't ever use any computer, we probably never will have any computerized systems in place for this kind of stuff.)<br><br>So, personal tasks lives in my SAF list.<br><br>Any suggestions?  I am very open to them!</div>

That's why I always liked the stalagmite/stalactite method for other versions of AF.  <br><br>The separation helps me stay focused on appropriate tasks.  I often work from home, which can tend to blur the division between work and personal.  One can sometimes feel that one is never working with 100% attention, but never free from work either.   Since I've worked from home for many years, I learned that I must draw a very strict division between "work time" and "personal time", to avoid this blurring.   So, my lists must maintain a clear distinction between work and personal.<br><br>But at the same time, I like to stay aware of the other list, in case anything urgent needs dealing with.<br><br><br>For now, I'm trying something new for this problem, rather than stalagmite/stalactite or backwards/forwards.   I am using separate pages, but all in the same SAF book, and all in one sequence.    So far it's working just fine.  <br><br>For example, when I started up the new SAF list a few days ago, I started a new Personal page, and also a new Work page.  As new tasks come up, I put them on the appropriate kind of page.  (Right now, I have two active pages of each type:  first a Personal Page, then a Work Page, then another Personal Page, then another Work page -- all interspersed.)<br><br>During working hours, I process my Work pages, following all the rules strictly.  I glance through my Personal pages whenever I happen to pass through them, especially the 2nd column, and I might take some action on this or that, but it is purely a matter of "taking a break" for a few minutes -- or in one or two cases, to deal with small but urgent personal tasks that arose during the day like calling the phone guy to come fix our phone line (can't call in the evening!).   I do not enforce ANY of the SAF rules on those pages, and usually just skip through them.<br><br>Likewise, on personal time, I process the Personal pages, strictly following the SAF rules, but still might glance thru the Work pages, especially the 2nd column.<br><br>Sometimes there's a bit of confusion on handling the urgent tasks.   Let's say it's working time, but I realize I need to make an urgent personal phone call in the next hour or two, and it's going to take more than just a few moments.  Do I write it on my Personal page, 2nd column?  Or on the Work page, 2nd column?   I've decided to just write it on the 2nd column of whatever page I happen to be on, not paying any attention to whether it's a Personal or Work task.<br><br>Another kind of potential list-confusion:  If I am at home with the kids, but I remember some urgent thing I need to do at work the next day, which 2nd column do I write it in?   In this case I write it on the next open Work page, 2nd column.<br><br>In the end it doesn't seem to matter much which 2nd column it goes on, since no matter which "context" I am currently in, I am still scanning the 2nd columns of the other "context" also.   So it has worked great so far.<br><br>(But it's only the third day, so maybe I'll find other issues!)</div>

Are we talking here about how to transit to the latest verson of SuperFocus, or about how to manage those commitments in general?>>><br><br>The topic of this thread is transition, so I'll stay on that.  I'll start a separate thread on handling family commitments, where we don't have project management systems set up for them, like we usually do for work projects.<br><br>The examples I gave are admittedly not the best.  Here are some better ones.  Generally they include specific details.  For example, it would be easy enough to drop "Research scholarships for daughter", because that topic will come up again, certainly.   But there are several tasks with specific leads on organizations that would be good to follow up on.  This research hasn't got to the point where it's large enough of a project to start up a folder and keep all the materials together -- it's just a list of some organizations and ideas.   That's why it lives in my AF list for now, with scattered entries here and there.<br><br>There are other tasks like that.  Do post-mortem with candidates on 2010 election" keeps popping into my mind, because we are planning for the next election cycle.  This task itself would not be at risk of disappearing from my list.  However, some of the specific actionable feedback I've already received from candidates and precinct committeemen is in my old AF list, and I don't want to lose those details.   And this is another case of a project that's still small enough to live in my AF list, and creating a special project folder would just add overhead.  <br><br>General activities and priorities are not at risk of being lost.  It's the ***specific, actionable details*** that I don't want to lose.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, I'm not sure what you asked then.  Anyway, if it's on my list and it's important, it WILL get done.  If it's not on the list yet important, it might not.  Currently I have important stuff that was on my list but got moved into a backlog.  This requires me to take care to get through that backlog to pick up these things.<br><br>Incidentally.  Since day one, I've been running this OneNote system wherein the details of each task are embedded in the task itself.  It works extremely slick.  It has also limited the need to create a system of organizing stuff outside of the task list.  It still would be useful to have such a system for reference materials, but I haven't mastered that topic.<br><br>This also means the list is much more important to me than others, because of the embedded materials.</div>

With SAF, it's quite likely, in fact.  <br><br>I'll lose the details if I don't copy the items forward to the new book.  So the chance of their getting actioned is zero.  It's also possible that I'd remember that there is (or might be) some detail in my old AF book, so I'd write it down in my new SAF book:  "go find that old detail".  And then I'd resist that for as long as possible, since it's so tedious to look through old AF notebooks for one needle in a haystack, and then finally spend the half hour or whatever to find that old detail.<br><br>I think I'd rather just knock out the task once for all by writing "clear out old AF books" as a single task that will get copied into column 2 repeatedly till it's done.</div>
